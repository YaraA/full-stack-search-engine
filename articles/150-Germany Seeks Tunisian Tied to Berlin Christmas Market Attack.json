He traveled to Germany in July 2015 and applied for asylum in April this year, receiving papers that allowed him to stay in the country temporarily. He lived for a time in housing designated for asylum seekers in the city of Emmerich am Rhein, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, and in Berlin.\n\nAt a news conference in D\u00fcsseldorf, Ralf J\u00e4ger, the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, said that federal prosecutors had been observing the Tunisian man \u2014 he did not use Mr. Amri\u2019s name \u2014 on suspicion that he might have been plotting an attack. When the man moved to Berlin in February, state authorities there picked up the monitoring.\n\nThe man was to have been deported in June, Mr. J\u00e4ger said. But because he did not have a valid passport, and because Tunisia did not initially acknowledge that he was a citizen, it was not possible to send him home. (Only on Wednesday did the Tunisian authorities issue a passport, he said.)\n\nMr. Mayer, the lawmaker, said the Tunisian man had spent a day in custody pending deportation, but because the authorities were unable to establish his identity \u201cbeyond doubt,\u201d he was released. \u201cThis is a person who apparently was known to be potentially dangerous and who apparently was to be deported,\u201d Mr. Mayer said.\n\nIn August, Mr. Amri was arrested in the southern city of Friedrichshafen with a fake Italian document and released a short while later, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation.\n\nVideo\n\nAn identity document found in a wallet left on the floor of the truck led the German authorities to seek the Tunisian man, said Frank Tempel of the Left Party. The document showed that the suspect had been allowed to remain in Germany but that he had not been granted full asylum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral of the men involved in the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, in Brussels in March and in Nice in July were of Tunisian origin, but the number of Tunisians in Germany is low.\n\nMr. Amri is believed to come from the impoverished south of Tunisia, on the edge of the Sahara. His father told a Tunisian radio station, Mosa\u00efque FM, that his son left Tunisia about seven years ago and served four years in prison in Italy after he was accused of setting fire to a school. The son was sentenced in absentia in Tunisia to five years in prison for violent robbery, the radio station reported.\n\nTunisians make up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and Libya and have held leadership roles in the Islamic State. Tunisian security officials say the militants have been active in recruiting young volunteers in Tunisia and have links to immigrant networks in Europe.\n\nA prominent Tunisian commander in the Islamic State, Boubaker al-Hakim, who was wanted in connection with terrorist attacks in Tunisia and was linked to the January 2015 attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, was reported killed last month in a drone strike in Raqqa, Syria.\n\nAccording to the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the Tunisian man being sought in Germany had lived in the city of Dortmund with a man named Boban S., who has been arrested and accused of involvement with the Islamic State.\n\nPhoto\n\nBoban S., in turn, is reported to have connections with Abu Walaa, the Iraqi who is known as \u201cthe man with no face,\u201d because he often preached in Arabic and in poor German, with his back to the camera. The authorities arrested Abu Walaa on Nov. 8.\n\nAbu Walaa, who has also been identified by officials as Ahmed Abdulaziz A., made his base in Hildesheim, a city of 100,000 south of Hanover, where he drew an increasingly devoted following and even offered his own app in 2014.\n\nHe was charged with recruiting terrorists and openly supporting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Tuesday, the authorities arrested a 23-year-old Pakistani man who had applied for asylum in Germany, but they released him hours later, citing a lack of evidence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Merkel and other officials have emphasized that they did not want the attack to jeopardize Germany\u2019s commitment to a free and open society, and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier reaffirmed that idea on Wednesday. \u201cWe want to uphold this way of life, and not let it be destroyed by anyone, not even whoever was responsible for what happened here,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nChristmas markets in major German cities appeared to heed a call by Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re, the interior minister, to stay open. In Bonn, crowds continued to show up under the watch of the police. In cities like Dresden, the Berlin attack had its ominous presence felt with large obstacles to keep vehicles from getting among the stalls. The same was true in Vienna\u2019s two famous markets, in neighboring Austria.\n\nPhoto\n\nLaws and traditions in Germany strongly emphasize personal privacy, and the identities of the victims of the attack have barely begun to emerge.\n\nOne of the victims was a 65-year-old woman from Neuss, a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, according to news reports.\n\nFabrizia Di Lorenzo, an Italian transportation specialist who has been living in Germany for three years, has been missing since Monday, and her father, Gaetano Di Lorenzo, said he feared the worst.\n\n\u201cWe are here with my wife, waiting for the DNA results,\u201d he said in an interview with the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. \u201cWe are waiting for confirmation, but I am not deluding myself.\u201d\n\nThe daughter\u2019s cellphone and transit pass were found near the scene immediately after the attack, her relatives and friends reported on Tuesday on social media.\n\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the attack \u201cmay have claimed the life of an Israeli citizen.\u201d He was referring to Dalia Elkayam, who has been missing since Monday and whose husband, Rami Elkayam, was seriously injured in the attack.\n\nAnother victim of the attack was a Polish truck driver, Lukasz Urban, 37, who had a wife and young child and who was found dead in the cab of the truck. He had been stabbed and shot."}
