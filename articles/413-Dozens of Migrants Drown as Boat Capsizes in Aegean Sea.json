Of the 15 children found dead, four were infants, the official said. The victims\u2019 nationalities were not immediately known.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nAfter nightfall, Coast Guard vessels continued to scour the area for survivors. Rescuers were also searching for four children who had been missing since Saturday after their boat capsized off the island of Samos, north of Farmakonisi.\n\nSunday\u2019s wreck was the latest in a catalog of drownings that underscored the desperation of thousands of refugees fleeing war and of migrants seeking better lives in Western Europe. For most of those who make it, Greece is just a stop on a journey through the Balkans aimed at wealthy nations like Germany and Scandinavian countries like Sweden known for generous welfare programs.\n\nGreece has long been a favored entry point, along with Italy and Malta. But the influx into Greece increased drastically this year, partly because of continuing strife in Syria and other parts of the Middle East. In the first eight months of the year, 230,000 people were intercepted by the Greek Coast Guard, compared with 17,500 in the same period last year, according to the shipping minister, Nikos Zois. Last week, Greece asked for emergency funding from the European Union to improve its response to the migration crisis and to set up additional reception facilities.\n\nFigures released by the International Organization for Migration last week stated that more than 430,000 migrants and refugees crossed the Mediterranean to Europe this year, with 2,748 drowning or going missing on the way.\n\nSpeaking earlier Sunday on Lesbos, another Greek island that has borne the brunt of a seemingly relentless flow of migrants, Greece\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Vassiliki Thanou, dismissed criticism of the country\u2019s efforts as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d She called on critics to \u201cconsider the size of the responsibility of guarding European borders that stretch along 16,000 kilometers of coastline.\u201d\n\nHer statement came a day after Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany called on Athens to intensify its attempts to protect the European Union\u2019s external borders. \u201cGreece needs to assume its responsibility,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Greece, which is struggling with an enduring financial crisis as well as political upheaval, the surge in arrivals of migrants and refugees could not have come at a more challenging time. Islands like Lesbos, Kos and Samos, which are closest to Turkey, have been particularly overwhelmed and lack the resources to accommodate the thousands arriving daily at their shores.\n\nTensions peaked on Lesbos this month with scuffles between police officers and migrants in the main port. The situation improved last week after more than 20,000 migrants were transferred by ferry to Greece\u2019s main port, Piraeus, near Athens, relieving the pressure on the island of 80,000 residents.\n\nMost of the migrants are now camping in squares across the capital, planning the next leg of their journey deeper into Europe.", "summary": "ATHENS \u2014 The Greek Coast Guard recovered the bodies of 34 migrants, including 15 children, on Sunday in the Aegean Sea after their wooden boat flipped over in strong winds as it attempted the short but often perilous crossing from nearby Turkey.
