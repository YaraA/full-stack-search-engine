Their chants of \u201cWir Sind das Volk,\u201d or \u201cWe are the people,\u201d have both struck a chord and sent a shudder throughout Germany.\n\nNerves were rattled last Friday, when three buildings newly renovated for a few dozen refugees in Vorra, a village of 1,000 near Nuremberg, were burned in what appeared to be arson attacks. A swastika and an anti-refugee slogan were daubed on one of the burned structures.\n\nVideo\n\nThe hand-wringing over anti-foreigner and right-wing sentiment crested in the last week. The three most prominent television hosts each devoted a whole show to the protests in Dresden, which are led by a group known as Pegida, a German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against Islamization of the West.\n\nOpposition parties \u2014 the Greens and the Left Party \u2014 have accused Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc of Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, of being too tentative in criticism of the protests because they fear losing votes on the right.\n\nThe German justice minister, Heiko Maas, a Social Democrat in Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition government of center-left and center-right parties, called Dresden demonstrators \u201ca shame for Germany.\u201d The majority of Germans, Mr. Maas said Monday, want to welcome refugees \u201cwho have just lost everything.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Every February, on the anniversary of the Allied bombing of 1945, Dresden is the venue for Germany\u2019s biggest annual far-right protest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPolitics in eastern Germany, where memories of Communist rule are still strong a quarter-century after reunification, are notoriously febrile, and it is unclear whether Alternative for Germany can reach the 5 percent threshold needed for any legislative representation in Berlin, either in coming western German state elections, or in national elections to be held in 2017.\n\nOver the weekend, Alternative party leaders clashed over whether to heed the Dresden demonstrators. One leader, Alexander Gauland, said in a telephone interview that he would go Monday and talk with Pegida marchers. \u201cI would like to know who they are,\u201d he said, condemning other politicians for dismissing the Dresden crowd as out of hand.\n\n\u201cObviously, for the most part, these are normal people from right in the middle of society,\u201d Mr. Gauland said."}
