Running from a far-left party that got 1 percent of the vote in the last election, Mr. Poutou had little to lose.\n\nThere was going to be trouble.\n\nIt came like a Scud missile, as Le Monde put it.\n\nMr. Poutou turned to Ms. Le Pen, whose surging National Front appears on the verge of a historic breakthrough, all but guaranteed a place in May\u2019s presidential runoff against the other probable finalist, the former economy minister Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAt the same time, her party is mired in twin corruption scandals, one involving fake jobs at the European Parliament, the other fake campaign-expense billing reimbursed by the state. Close associates have been charged.\n\nMs. Le Pen, a supposed \u201coutsider\u201d candidate from a populist party, has refused to answer a police summons, invoking \u201cparliamentary immunity.\u201d\n\nThat angered Mr. Poutou. He didn\u2019t bother with honorifics or first names \u2014 another sore point for the offended television commentators.\n\n\u201cAnd then we\u2019ve got Le Pen, next to me, Le Pen, dipping into the public purse,\u201d Mr. Poutou said. \u201cIt\u2019s not here, it\u2019s Europe, and now for somebody who is anti-European, the worst is that the National Front, which calls itself anti-system, it doesn\u2019t give a damn. It protects itself thanks to the laws of the system, thanks to parliamentary immunity, and so refuses to answer a police summons.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s Vote: The Basics The presidential election will be held in two stages.\n\nThen he scored what was acknowledged as the evening\u2019s bull\u2019s-eye, aimed squarely at Ms. Le Pen: \u201cWhen we workers are summoned by the police, we don\u2019t have worker\u2019s immunity. Sorry about that. There it is. Here we go,\u201d Mr. Poutou said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe didn\u2019t look as if he was joking. The studio audience burst into applause. Ms. Le Pen, visibly flustered, was left uncharacteristically silent. She had been attacked by a factory worker for being a privileged child of the system \u2014 a nuclear hit against a rabble-rousing candidate whose rallies are always framed by banners with the words \u201cIn the name of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe blow,\u201d Le Monde commented, \u201cwas sharp.\u201d\n\nEditorial writers across France hailed Mr. Poutou, and his sally lit up social media.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He scored the winning hit. This is what will be remembered.\u201d\n\nMr. Fillon, the candidate of the R\u00e9publicains, and at one time the race\u2019s front-runner, was hardly spared by Mr. Poutou. He has dropped steadily in the polls since being put under investigation, and now criminally charged, over accusations that he used public money to pay his wife for a phony job as a parliamentary assistant.\n\nRevelations that a political fixer recently bought him two fine suits for over $13,000 at one of Paris\u2019s fanciest tailors have not helped. Mr. Fillon\u2019s image of probity has been shattered, and his platform of austerity for France is the object of ridicule.\n\n\u201cFillon. Right. He\u2019s sitting across the room from me,\u201d Mr. Poutou began. His target shifted uneasily in his seat, a tight smile on his face. \u201cNothing but revelations,\u201d Mr. Poutou continued. \u201cThe more one digs, the more one smells corruption and cheating, and then, it\u2019s these fine folk who explain to us that we need rigor, austerity, and all the while dipping into the public purse.\u201d\n\nLe Monde heard Mr. Fillon mutter furiously, \u201cI\u2019m going to sock you with a damn lawsuit, you.\u201d\n\nAfterward, the television commentators in Paris sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t think Philippe Poutou deserves any honors,\u201d said Anna Cabana, an analyst on BFMTV. \u201cHe acted very disrespectfully.\u201d\n\nBut that was not the verdict on social media. And Mr. Fillon is now in danger of losing even his third-place perch in the first round of voting April 23 to another insurgent far-left candidate, the veteran Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, whose relatively unbridled style and populist fervor have caught on.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Poutou was enjoying his new celebrity Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit surprising. We\u2019re not used to it,\u201d Mr. Poutou, a mechanic in the maintenance and repair department of a Ford factory, said in a brief phone interview, dashing between appointments. \u201cIn the streets, it\u2019s very striking. People are saying bravo, thanks so much. We realize it\u2019s touched a lot of people. It\u2019s what people are thinking, but these things are almost never said to politicians\u2019 faces.\u201d", "summary": "Le Pen, whose surging National Front appears on the verge of a historic breakthrough, all but guaranteed a place in May\u2019s presidential runoff against the other probable finalist, the former economy minister Emmanuel Macron.Le Pen, a supposed \u201coutsider\u201d candidate from a populist party, has refused to answer a police summons, invoking \u201cparliamentary immunity.\u201dShe had been attacked by a factory worker for being a privileged child of the system \u2014 a nuclear hit against a rabble-rousing candidate whose rallies are always framed by banners with the words \u201cIn the name of the people.\u201dHe has dropped steadily in the polls since being put under investigation, and now criminally charged, over accusations that he used public money to pay his wife for a phony job as a parliamentary assistant.And Mr. Fillon is now in danger of losing even his third-place perch in the first round of voting April 23 to another insurgent far-left candidate, the veteran Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, whose relatively unbridled style and populist fervor have caught on."}
