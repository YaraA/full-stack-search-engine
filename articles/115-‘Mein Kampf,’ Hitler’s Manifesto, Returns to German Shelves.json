Chancellor Angela Merkel has found herself struggling to maintain popular support for her migrant policy amid concerns about the social and economic costs of accepting the new arrivals, as well as over religious extremism and national security.\n\nThose tensions were brought to the surface this week after reports that women were sexually assaulted and robbed on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne by groups of men described as having \u201ca North African or Arabic\u201d appearance.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, voters are increasingly turning to far-right and other populist parties after years of economic stagnation, dissatisfaction with mainstream parties and questions about national identity in the face of open borders for much of the Continent and an influx of migrants from outside it. Some far-right parties have appropriated Nazi imagery and texts.\n\nSome historians and education experts welcomed the new edition as part of modern Germany\u2019s pledge to \u201cnever forget, never repeat\u201d the atrocities committed under Hitler, through education and critical examination.\n\n\u201cWe concern ourselves with clarification,\u201d said Winfried Nerdinger, the director of the Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism in Munich, which opened last year. \u201cOur understanding of the critical publication is that it will do the same.\u201d\n\nCritics argue that issuing a new edition, even one that contains thousands of painstaking historical notes, is but a further step in a process to defang Hitler and lessen the crimes for which he bears responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably inevitable \u2014 the process of \u2018normalizing\u2019 Hitler into just another tyrant, whose words are to be parsed and contextualized,\u201d said Ron Rosenbaum, the author of \u201cExplaining Hitler,\u201d considered one of the definitive examinations of the Nazi dictator\u2019s mind. \u201cNonetheless, it feels deeply disturbing, especially when Hitler\u2019s image has returned in hate rallies around the world.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nJewish groups in Germany have been split over the publication. The Central Council of Jews in Germany, which has long warned against further publication of the original work, welcomed the critical edition on Friday as an effort to counter anti-Semitism by placing Hitler\u2019s ideas in historical context. But the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany called for an absolute ban on any new editions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor many survivors, a new publication is a fresh slap in the face that damages Germany\u2019s international reputation,\u201d said R\u00fcdiger Mahlo, the German representative of the claims conference. \u201cSuch irrational racist slogans should not be spread anywhere, least of all in Germany.\u201d\n\nThe introduction to the new edition describes Hitler\u2019s writing as \u201chalf-baked, incoherent and difficult to read,\u201d partly because of the many grammatical errors. It goes on to examine how the work laid out the four ideas on which Hitler based his worldview and that later formed the basis of Nazi ideology: race, space, violence and dictatorship.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Each historian was assigned a chapter, he said, but the final notations were discussed and agreed on by the group.\n\n\u201cOf course there were differences of opinion, but these were mostly productive,\u201d Mr. Hartmann said, crediting the assistance of dozens of international experts.\n\nFor example, a passage in which Hitler refers to \u201cthe black-haired Jewish boy,\u201d is marked with a reference to a historical note that remarks, \u201cThe image of the \u2018black-haired Jew\u2019 was a widespread clich\u00e9.\u201d It goes on to cite other authors who used the phrase in the early 1930s, as well as a clinical study by the anthropologist Rudolf Virchow from the late 19th century that sought to debunk the myth.\n\n\u201cI think that German society is really ready for such a critical examination of the work,\u201d Mr. Hartmann said, adding that despite the intellectual nature of the new edition, the historians made an effort to ensure that it be accessible for a wide readership, whether in schools or society.\n\nExcerpts from \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d as well as letters and other Nazi texts, similarly critically annotated, have long been taught in German schools. Last month, the president of the German Association of Teachers, Josef Kraus, argued for integrating the new edition into high school classrooms, as part of efforts to educate young Germans about the dangers of extremist thinking and the atrocities carried out by previous generations.\n\n\u201cSchools cannot ignore \u2018Mein Kampf,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Kraus said, noting that forbidding the work would only drive up interest in the original volume, easily available online. \u201cIt is far better they be introduced to \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019 by trained, experienced history and political teachers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the edition\u2019s heft \u2014 the two volumes together weigh more than 10 pounds \u2014 and an announced price of 59 euros, or about $64, sales have already exceeded expectations. The Institute of Contemporary History had to increase its initial run of 4,000 copies after receiving about 15,000 pre-orders before Friday\u2019s release, Mr. Wirsching said.\n\nEven so, the book sold out within hours on Amazon\u2019s German site, where it was listed as \u201cnot available, due to limited publication.\u201d\n\nIan Kershaw, a British historian who has written about Hitler, noted the importance of finally having an annotated version of the work for German and historical studies, but cautioned against expecting too much from the new edition. Calling the interest surrounding its publication a \u201cnine-day wonder,\u201d he said it would not have a lasting impact on the myth surrounding the original in many parts of the world.\n\n\u201cThe countries that abuse \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019 will continue to do so,\u201d Mr. Kershaw added. \u201cI don\u2019t think this edition will discourage or prevent that.\u201d", "summary": "The republication, even with critical annotations, of a work that advocated an Aryan \u201cmaster race\u201d comes as Germany finds itself at a crossroads after one million migrants, many fleeing conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan, crossed its borders over the past year.
