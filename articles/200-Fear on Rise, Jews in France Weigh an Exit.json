{"title": "Fear on Rise, Jews in France Weigh an Exit", "authors": ["Dan Bilefsky"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/13/world/europe/fear-on-rise-jews-in-france-weigh-an-exit.html", "body": "France was the largest source of Jews moving to Israel last year, according to the Jewish Agency for Israel, which coordinates migration to Israel. Its director, Natan Sharansky, predicted that up to 15,000 French Jews would emigrate this year, and that more than 50,000 French Jews would leave in the next few years. There are roughly 500,000 Jews in France, which has Europe\u2019s largest Jewish population.\n\n\u201cThere is enormous anxiety, a lot of anger and bitterness and a feeling that the Jewish community in France is under siege,\u201d Mr. Cwajgenbaum said. \u201cIt has become evident that there is an internal war against the Jews being waged by Islamic radicals in this country, and people are very upset that the judicial system and the security apparatus were not able to thwart the attack.\u201d\n\nEven before this latest attack, many Jews were afraid after Mohammed Merah, a Frenchman with Algerian roots, killed seven people in 2012 in southern France, including three children and a rabbi at a Jewish school in Toulouse.\n\nIn January 2013, Dieudonn\u00e9 M\u2019bala M\u2019bala, a comedian of French and West African heritage, had a series of his shows shut down by the French authorities. He had said it was a shame that a Jewish journalist had not been killed in the gas chambers. He has also drawn criticism for popularizing a gesture that strongly resembles a Nazi salute.\n\nMore on the Paris Shootings\n\nOn his Facebook page after Sunday\u2019s unity march, Mr. M\u2019bala M\u2019bala wrote: \u201cAs far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly,\u201d alluding to the \u201cI am Charlie\u201d rallying cry that took hold after the terror attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said Monday that it was investigating to determine whether Mr. M\u2019bala M\u2019bala had promoted terrorism.\n\nThe French authorities said Monday that thousands of police officers and soldiers would be deployed to protect Jewish schools and other \u201csensitive sites,\u201d in one of the country\u2019s biggest peacetime security operations. In the Marais district of Paris, two soldiers wearing camouflage gear and holding guns were seen patrolling near a Jewish school.\n\nFrench leaders, fearing the consequences of an exodus of Jews from France, have issued robust expressions of support. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Saturday that \u201cFrance without Jews is not France.\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, wearing a skullcap, joined Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at a commemoration event at the Grand Synagogue of Paris on Sunday. He had already deplored the attack as a horrific act of anti-Semitism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Jewish residents said the new security measures were not enough to restore frayed nerves. Some said they were already planning to pack their bags for Israel, urged on by Mr. Netanyahu, who told French Jews on Sunday that they would be welcomed with \u201copen arms.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Netanyahu stopped by the targeted kosher supermarket and met with one of the rescued hostages. A large group of Jewish residents roared its applause and waved Israeli flags.\n\nMr. Netanyahu, like many Jews here, singled out Islamic terrorism as the biggest threat to Jews in France and beyond. \u201cA direct line leads between the attacks of extremist Islam around the world to the attack that took place here at a kosher supermarket in the heart of Paris,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said the attack was an act by a fanatic, and that most French Muslims were appalled.\n\n\u201cWhat happened has nothing to do with Islam,\u201d he said. But a nearby Jewish resident rejected that argument, and asked him why more Muslims had not come out to voice their disapproval.\n\nMr. Sharansky said the attacks in Paris had helped reinforce the deepest insecurity among French Jews since World War II. He said a record 7,000 French Jews emigrated to Israel from France in 2014 \u2014 the largest number since the founding of the State of Israel in 1948 and the largest last year among global Jewery to make \u201caliyah,\u201d the Hebrew word for immigration that means \u201cto ascend.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nHe said that 1,000 people had arrived by 1 p.m. at a Paris fair on emigration to Israel held at the agency on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt is not just because of one terrorist attack, but a series of attacks against Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready, rabbis have been telling people not to wear\u201d their skullcaps on the streets.\n\nWhile some critics have accused Mr. Netanyahu of exploiting a tragedy by encouraging French Jews to flock to Israel, Mr. Sharansky argued that Israel, as the Jewish state, had a moral imperative to offer safe refuge to Jews. He said that Israel was not seeking to use terrorism to encourage people to emigrate, as \u201cterror is bad for Zionism, as it encourages Jews to be afraid and to assimilate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany Jews in the crowd outside Hyper Cacher on Monday said their French identity existed proudly alongside their Jewish one, and complained that criticism of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinians was being projected on Jews. They said that the recent passage by the French National Assembly of a nonbinding resolution recognizing a Palestinian state had fanned tensions.\n\nSylvain Zenouda, the vice president of a French organization that campaigns against anti-Semitism, was among the crowd gathered to meet Mr. Netanyahu. He said he was having flashbacks to the 1960s, when he and his family fled Morocco for France amid fears about violence against Jews.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, we packed our bags overnight and fled,\u201d said Mr. Zenouda, who has three children. \u201cThis time we will take our time and won\u2019t flee in the night. But Jews will leave for Israel where we can feel safe.\u201d\n\nAmong the victims of the attack at the supermarket was Yoav Hattab, 21, whom the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration said was the son of the grand rabbi of Tunisia. He was studying marketing in Paris, and often went to the supermarket on Fridays to prepare for the Sabbath.\n\nMyriam Hattab, Yoav Hattab\u2019s cousin, said Yoav had been brimming with ambition and excitement to live and study in Paris, and that the family, who had come from Tunisia to Paris to mourn, no longer felt safe here. \u201cI have always loved France, but when I see that there are terrorists who can commit such acts in the heart of the capital, I am afraid,\u201d she said.\n\nSome Jewish residents said that in recent days they had found themselves looking resentfully and fearfully at women wearing head scarves and at young Muslim men.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel fear,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cI feel hatred.\u201d Yet, she said, for the time being, she will not leave France. \u201cLeaving would be caving in to terrorism,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we leave, the terrorists win.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cIt has become evident that there is an internal war against the Jews being waged by Islamic radicals in this country, and people are very upset that the judicial system and the security apparatus were not able to thwart the attack.\u201dEven before this latest attack, many Jews were afraid after Mohammed Merah, a Frenchman with Algerian roots, killed seven people in 2012 in southern France, including three children and a rabbi at a Jewish school in Toulouse.The French authorities said Monday that thousands of police officers and soldiers would be deployed to protect Jewish schools and other \u201csensitive sites,\u201d in one of the country\u2019s biggest peacetime security operations.Some said they were already planning to pack their bags for Israel, urged on by Mr. Netanyahu, who told French Jews on Sunday that they would be welcomed with \u201copen arms.\u201dSome Jewish residents said that in recent days they had found themselves looking resentfully and fearfully at women wearing head scarves and at young Muslim men."}
