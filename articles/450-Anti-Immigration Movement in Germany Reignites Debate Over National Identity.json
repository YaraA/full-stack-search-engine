Just in the past month, it has become possible for the first time for almost everyone born in Germany to foreign parents to hold dual citizenship.\n\nThis is not the first time that identity issues have surfaced in Germany. After the Nazis were defeated in World War II, millions of ethnic Germans were driven from parts of Eastern Europe. There was never any hesitation about taking them in because their heritage was provably German.\n\nLater, when the new, bustling West Germany needed workers, Turks, Greeks and Italians arrived as \u201cguest laborers\u201d \u2014 and many never returned. Instead, they founded families or brought them from home, living in tightknit communities largely isolated from Germans except in the workplace. That sentiment of separation lingers to this day.\n\nIn 1990, East and West Germans reunited and discovered how different they were, despite both laying claim to German identity. Almost immediately, record numbers of war refugees arrived from the Balkans, complicating the already costly and difficult task of reunification.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEast Germans were unaccustomed to foreigners: Only 1 percent of their 17 million were foreign. Dresden\u2019s location, as the only major East German city that could not receive West German television, reinforced its isolation. The city has often been a site for right-wing rallies, and the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party of Germany has been elected at least twice to the state legislature.\n\nVideo\n\nBy 2000, there was a full-throated debate going on about what constituted being German. The newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung this week recalled that in 2001, four years before she became chancellor, Angela Merkel endorsed a party political paper that refused to identify Germany as a country of immigration. It stipulated that newcomers could not integrate without accepting \u201cthe value system of our Christian-Occidental culture, which was marked by Christianity, antique philosophy, humanism, Roman law and the Enlightenment,\u201d all phrases now heard from Pegida.\n\nOn Monday, the thousands who marched did so despite an unusually direct plea from Ms. Merkel to boycott such rallies, whose organizers, she said, had prejudice and \u201ceven hate in their hearts.\u201d\n\nIt is not just Ms. Merkel, and her Christian Democratic Union party, who has shifted markedly in the past 15 years. According to a new study on the role of religion and identity in contemporary Germany, based on the questioning of 8,270 representative Germans by the Berlin Institute for Integration and Migration Research at Humboldt University, \u201cbeing German today is something that can be learned and acquired,\u201d and is therefore no longer a matter of that ethnic heritage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Marchers spurned the news media, and few would be interviewed, but those who did expressed concerns that the country was being overrun by foreigners. It bothers them, some have said, to hand off a changed country to their children and grandchildren.\n\nBut in Dresden, capital of the southeastern state of Saxony, just 2.2 percent of the population are foreigners, and even fewer are practicing Muslims. By comparison, Germany over all has 8 percent to 9 percent without citizenship, many in cities like Berlin or Cologne, where counterdemonstrators outnumbered small Pegida rallies.\n\nGermany\u2019s shift toward a mix of cultures and backgrounds was evident last summer, when the country\u2019s World Cup-winning soccer squad returned to Brandenburg Gate in Berlin with their trophy. Stars like Miroslav Klose, Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira, just three of the 16 million or so Germans of immigrant background, were a vital part of the team. The players were feted by the country\u2019s No. 1 female singing star, Helene Fischer, born in 1984 \u2014 in Siberia."}
