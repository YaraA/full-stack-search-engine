Such tools are by no means limited to them, and are also used by migrants from Africa and the Middle East to Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nTraffickers advertise their services on Facebook like any legitimate travel agency, with dynamic photographs of destination cities and generous offers.\n\nOn the Arabic-language Facebook group Trafficking to Europe, one trafficker offers a 50 percent discount for children under 5. The 1,700 euro price of the journey from Istanbul to Thessaloniki, Greece, about $1,900, includes travel by car to and from each side of the border with a two-hour walk across.\n\n\u201cWe have cars going every day,\u201d the trafficker boasts. One user asked whether there was a family discount for multiple passengers. And in case one doubts the offer\u2019s veracity, the post has 39 \u201clikes.\u201d\n\nThe Trafficking to Europe group, with 6,057 members, is merely one small corner of an entire new world of social media available to Syrians and others making the perilous journey to Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSyrians are helped along their journeys by Arabic-language Facebook groups like \u201cSmuggling Into the E.U.,\u201d with 23,953 members, and \u201cHow to Emigrate to Europe,\u201d with 39,304.\n\nThe discussions are both public and private, requiring an invitation from a group administrator. Migrants share photos and videos of their journeys taken on their smartphones.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe groups are used widely by those traveling alone and with traffickers. In fact, the ease and autonomy the apps provide may be cutting into the smuggling business.\n\n\u201cRight now, the traffickers are losing business because people are going alone, thanks to Facebook,\u201d said Mohamed Haj Ali, 38, who works with the Adventist Development and Relief Agency in Belgrade, Serbia\u2019s capital \u2014 a major stopover for migrants.\n\nOriginally from Syria, Mr. Ali has lived in Belgrade for three years, helping migrants and listening to their stories. At first, he said, most migrants passing through Serbia had paid traffickers for most or all of their trip.\n\nBut as tens of thousands completed their journeys, they shared their experiences on social media \u2014 even the precise GPS coordinates of every stop along their routes, recorded automatically by some smartphones.\n\nFor those traveling today, the prices charged by traffickers have gone down by about half since the beginning of the conflict, Mr. Ali said.\n\nThe only part of the journey that most migrants still pay traffickers for, he said, is the crossing from Turkey to Greece. Many migrants now feel able to make the rest of the journey on their own with a GPS-equipped smartphone and without paying traffickers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ali noted the popularity of Facebook groups such as \u201cSmuggle Yourself to Europe Without a Trafficker.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSyrians are not idiots,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Aljasem, encountered in the park, said he kept in touch with his 21 siblings in five countries through WhatsApp, which requires only an Internet connection. Their private messaging group is called Our Family.\n\nOnce he left Syria, Mr. Aljasem said one of the first things he did was get a new smartphone, because it was too dangerous to travel with one in Syria. Soldiers at government checkpoints, as well as at Islamic State checkpoints, commonly demand Facebook passwords, he said. They look at Facebook profiles to determine one\u2019s allegiance in the war.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Krzysiek said that because of the water crisis, posts on the group\u2019s Facebook Syria page had reached 10 times as many people as regular posts about the group\u2019s activities.\n\nAccording to a Facebook analytics report, the committee\u2019s map of safe water distribution sites in Aleppo was seen by 133,187 people, and received 14,683 clicks and 4,859 likes, comments and shares.\n\nAnother example Mr. Krzysiek gave was a popular Facebook page in Syria reporting real-time counts of mortar rounds falling on Damascus and maps of their locations, allowing users to avoid certain areas.\n\nMohammed Salmoni, 21, from Kabul, Afghanistan, who had stopped to charge his phone at a newspaper kiosk in Belgrade, credited it with saving his life.\n\nHe used it to navigate a 40-hour walk across the Afghan province of Nimruz to the Iranian city of Zahedan. \u201cIt was very dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nFor others, cellphones are an archive of still deeper connections.\n\nShadad Alhassan, 39, said he had \u201clost everything\u201d when his home was bombed in Damascus, where he once worked installing electrical inverters in a skyscraper under construction.\n\n\u201cMy wife died in the bombing,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have nothing left besides my two sons.\u201d He indicated Wassem, 10, and Nazih, 9, sitting with him on a sleeping bag on the dirt in the park.\n\nHis smartphone held photographs, his only connection to the life he once lived.", "summary": "Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends. \u201cRight now, the traffickers are losing business because people are going alone, thanks to Facebook,\u201d said Mohamed Haj Ali, 38, who works with the Adventist Development and Relief Agency in Belgrade, Serbia\u2019s capital \u2014 a major stopover for migrants.
