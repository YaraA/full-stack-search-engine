Some Scots say they are not quite sure what he believes in, other than Scotland, and some women on Mumsnet, a website for parents, described him as patronizing. Asked if Mr. Salmond could be elected as the leader of an independent Scotland, Mr. Quinn said that he was not sure, but that a new Scotland would need Mr. Salmond at least to negotiate terms of the divorce from London. \u201cHe\u2019s a clever man to negotiate, with a background in economics and business as well as politics,\u201d Mr. Quinn said.\n\nOne of his cleverest moves in this campaign has been to associate independence with Team Scotland and those who wish to remain in the United Kingdom with Team Westminster, as if preferring to keep the 307-year union was somehow \u201cun-Scottish.\u201d\n\nEven if the independence movement falls short, Mr. Salmond plans to remain as Scotland\u2019s first minister.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was born on Hogmanay, the Scots\u2019 word for New Year\u2019s Eve, in 1954. His grandfather spoke to him of local figures joining the 14th-century resistance to English rule that culminated in 1314, at Bannockburn, where the Scottish king, Robert the Bruce, destroyed a larger invading army of the English king, Edward II.\n\n\u201cMy granddad told me how things should be, more than how things were,\u201d Mr. Salmond said in an interview last spring. But Mr. Salmond only became an activist with the fringe Scottish National Party at the University of St. Andrews, where he studied medieval history and economics.\n\nEven there, at one of Scotland\u2019s fanciest schools, he began a campaign for student body president against a Conservative and nearly won. It was, Mr. Salmond said, the only election he has ever lost, and clearly he does not intend to lose to another well-born Conservative, Prime Minister David Cameron, on Thursday.\n\nMr. Cameron and the other two leaders of Britain\u2019s main parties, Ed Miliband of Labour and Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, on Tuesday again pledged, in a letter in The Daily Record of Scotland, \u201cextensive new powers\u201d for the Scots if they vote to stay within the United Kingdom.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there were few details, because the party leaders were still negotiating their offer among themselves. Mr. Salmond was dismissive. \u201cIt\u2019s totally inadequate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing approaching the powers that Scotland needs to create jobs, to save the health service and build a better society.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

At 26, he married Moira McGlashan, then 43, who later became his boss.\n\nHe rose through the Scottish National Party at a dark time for its prospects, as Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 election to become prime minister and the number of Scottish nationalist members of Parliament declined to two from 11.\n\nAfter winning the argument to move more power from the British Parliament back to Scotland and re-establish a Scottish Parliament, Mr. Salmond quit the leadership of his party in 2000 and stayed away for nearly five years, without much explanation.\n\nHe returned and led his party to dominate the Scottish Parliament in the 2007 elections and become Scotland\u2019s leader, or first minister. Fraser Nelson, a Scot who is the editor of the weekly magazine, The Spectator, once wrote that after those years of \u201cplaying dead, swearing he\u2019d never come back, today every party leader in the House of Commons will wish he\u2019s kept that promise.\u201d\n\nInstead, the Scottish National Party won an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament in 2011, devastating the Scottish Labour Party and giving Mr. Salmond the mandate to demand the independence referendum and negotiate it with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. Mr. Cameron insisted on a one-question referendum \u2014 in or out \u2014 which at the time seemed like a smart political decision intended to settle the issue once and for all.\n\nNow, it seems like a risky gamble, one that Mr. Salmond, who likes betting on the horses, was willing to take.\n\nHe has proved his political and debating skills, decrying \u201cfear-mongering\u201d and promising Scots that independence will bring them greater social benefits and that the local health service will be protected, while avoiding specifics and shrugging off the criticism and projections of misery from many business executives and economists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Salmond remains a rather lonely and even divisive figure whose self-assurance has been identified by opponents as a potential weakness. In the first of two television debates with Alistair Darling, a former chancellor of the Exchequer who leads the \u201cno\u201d campaign, Mr. Darling won applause from the studio audience by mocking Mr. Salmond\u2019s self-confidence. \u201cI want you to do something that is really difficult,\u201d Mr. Darling said. \u201cI want you to contemplate for one minute you might be wrong.\u201d\n\nLast year, in a largely sympathetic interview with Holyrood magazine, Mr. Salmond spoke about his challenge \u2014 and his sense of grievance.\n\n\u201cThe weight of the establishment has rained down on me for a very long time, and I am still here and quite a bit of the establishment is not,\u201d he said.\n\nSo now, he said, \u201cI take the establishment raining down on me and on the S.N.P. as a compliment.\u201d As for his opponents, he said, \u201cThey seem very anxious, do they not?\u201d", "summary": "But Mr. Salmond only became an activist with the fringe Scottish National Party at the University of St. Andrews, where he studied medieval history and economics.Mr. Cameron and the other two leaders of Britain\u2019s main parties, Ed Miliband of Labour and Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, on Tuesday again pledged, in a letter in The Daily Record of Scotland, \u201cextensive new powers\u201d for the Scots if they vote to stay within the United Kingdom.When Mr. Miliband appeared at a shopping center in Edinburgh on Tuesday to make the case for continued union, he was heckled relentlessly by supporters of independence, news reports said.Fraser Nelson, a Scot who is the editor of the weekly magazine, The Spectator, once wrote that after those years of \u201cplaying dead, swearing he\u2019d never come back, today every party leader in the House of Commons will wish he\u2019s kept that promise.\u201dHe has proved his political and debating skills, decrying \u201cfear-mongering\u201d and promising Scots that independence will bring them greater social benefits and that the local health service will be protected, while avoiding specifics and shrugging off the criticism and projections of misery from many business executives and economists."}
