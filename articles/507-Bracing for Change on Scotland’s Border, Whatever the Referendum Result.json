{"title": "Bracing for Change on Scotland\u2019s Border, Whatever the Referendum Result", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/world/europe/scottish-independence-referendum-berwick-upon-tweed.html", "body": "An independent Scotland would raise questions about currency and finance, about where to base Britain\u2019s fleet of nuclear submarines, about border security in a period of terrorism, about whether Scotland would still get BBC television and about whether members of Parliament from Scotland, the vast majority of them from the Labour Party, would lose their seats. And then, of course, there is the question of whether the United Kingdom would need to replace the Union Jack, and with what.\n\nIt would be an enormous victory for the Scottish National Party and its leader, Alex Salmond, and would kick off a difficult 18 months of negotiations with the British government about the terms of the divorce, which would become official in March 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut should the Scots vote against independence on Thursday, said Dougie Watkin, a farmer with land and sheep on both sides of the border, \u201chalf the population will be very disappointed.\u201d The leaders of the three main British parties have promised all kinds of new powers for Scotland if the Scots do vote no. Even so, if the margin proves to be narrow, the issue of independence, as in Quebec, is unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\nEven in Berwick, with a population of 15,000, the questions range from the effects on trade and immigration to whether small businesses would have to fill out two sets of tax forms and deal with two currencies. \u201cIf there\u2019s independence, will I be paying income tax in one country and business tax in the other?\u201d Ms. Murray asked. \u201cI can\u2019t afford an accountant, and there\u2019s already so much paperwork now, that would put us out of business.\u201d\n\nWhat about pensions and university education, when Scotland offers free tuition and England does not? What if Scotland has a different corporate or personal income tax rate?\n\n\u201cWhat are the plans in place for all these issues?\u201d Ms. Murray asked. \u201cThey\u2019re not there.\u201d\n\nKeith Siseman, who runs an art gallery with a liquor license called Pier Red, said that Scottish independence would turn things \u201cupside down.\u201d\n\nThe power and influence of Britain in the world would be diminished, he said, with new questions about whether Britain could afford to keep its nuclear missiles, which are submarine-based, in a Scotland that says it wants to be nuclear-free.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBerwick is two miles from the border and is the only English town with a soccer team, the Rangers, that plays in the Scottish league, a legacy of the days when a poor railway network made the rest of England difficult to reach.\n\nThat feeling of remoteness carries on. Many people in Northumberland say they feel much the same alienation from the Westminster Parliament as the people of Scotland do.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWhen the Scots say these posh boys from southern England are very far away and don\u2019t care about them, I know just what it\u2019s like, here in the northern end of Northumberland,\u201d said Simon Heald, who runs a used-book shop.\n\nThe no campaign has tried to frighten the Scots on pocketbook issues, which patronizes and infuriates them, when Mr. Cameron and his colleagues \u201cshould have been pouring love up north, and not fear,\u201d Mr. Heald said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put the fear of God into a nation like Scotland that\u2019s up for a fight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t send the Scottish battalions into war first for no reason.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And Mr. Cameron, by insisting on only one question \u2014 independence or not \u2014 has made this vote into a great gamble. Even Mr. Salmond had wanted another option on the ballot, one of further devolution of power over Scotland\u2019s affairs to the Scottish Parliament, which already has substantial autonomy from the central government in London.\n\n\u201cWe want to control our own country,\u201d said Roddy Low, 47. \u201cA lot of people are fed up with being told what to do by Westminster, and not just by the Tories. This has been growing for 30, 40 years.\u201d\n\nHe was speaking across the River Tweed in Coldstream, Scotland, the original home of the Coldstream Guards, one of the few British regiments that now help to guard Queen Elizabeth II, and from where, in 1660, soldiers marched to London to restore Charles II to the throne.\n\nVideo\n\nJohn Dickson, who was buying lamb in the local butcher shop in Coldstream, said he had no doubts. \u201cIt\u2019s the only chance we\u2019ve had in 300 years, and if we miss it, there\u2019ll never be another,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people want to go to bed with the English, I\u2019ll help them carry the mattress south.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMalcolm Campbell, 53, a pro-independence Scot who was fishing for salmon in the Tweed, said that of course there would be problems to solve if Scotland voted for independence, but that Scotland could work them out.\n\n\u201cThey try to scare us about the pound,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have a currency and it will work, and we won\u2019t go back to the barter system of a kilo of tomatoes for a pound of salt. If people want it to work, it will work.\u201d\n\nHis son, Grant, 22, also said he would vote yes. He went to Abertay University in Dundee at no cost, under legislation passed by the Scottish National Party that distinguishes Scotland from England, where college students typically have to pay thousands of pounds in tuition. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a thank you to the S.N.P.,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout them, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to go to university.\u201d\n\nIn Scotland, which is largely left-leaning, \u201cwe have a completely different set of political principles from England,\u201d the younger Mr. Campbell said. \u201cWe can still have a social union with the English, so I see no sadness in it.\u201d\n\nBut in Coldstream, too, there is anxiety and a sizable number of people, like Malcolm Bolam, the owner of the butcher shop, who say they will vote no but who are keeping their heads down given the deep passions of the campaign.\n\n\u201cThere are far too many questions unanswered for me to say yes,\u201d Mr. Bolam said. He has two young girls, and he worries about big companies and banks moving to England, about jobs disappearing and taxes then going up in a Scotland where North Sea oil and gas are slowly being depleted. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of customers from the other side\u201d for his pure Scottish meat, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose them.\u201d\n\nBack in Berwick, Mr. Siseman predicted further dissolution. \u201cThis is a happy family that could be getting divorced for no real reason,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s scary, because it won\u2019t end here. Because if the Scots get it, the Shetland Islanders will want it, and we\u2019ll end up with the United Nothing.\u201d", "summary": "It would be an enormous victory for the Scottish National Party and its leader, Alex Salmond, and would kick off a difficult 18 months of negotiations with the British government about the terms of the divorce, which would become official in March 2016.Berwick is two miles from the border and is the only English town with a soccer team, the Rangers, that plays in the Scottish league, a legacy of the days when a poor railway network made the rest of England difficult to reach.Mr. Cameron and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, have been fiercely criticized for leaving their campaign to preserve the union until too late, assuming that the no vote would win easily.He went to Abertay University in Dundee at no cost, under legislation passed by the Scottish National Party that distinguishes Scotland from England, where college students typically have to pay thousands of pounds in tuition.He has two young girls, and he worries about big companies and banks moving to England, about jobs disappearing and taxes then going up in a Scotland where North Sea oil and gas are slowly being depleted."}
