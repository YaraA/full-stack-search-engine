{"title": "When Britain Goes to Vote, European Union May Feel the Results", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/world/europe/british-election-european-union.html", "body": "Britain is today a uniquely truculent and uneasy European partner, one that chose not to adopt the euro as its currency and that finds itself frequently at odds with Brussels over issues like financial regulation.\n\nIn European capitals, there is concern about a referendum in a country that many regard as a central part of the European Union, according to Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.\n\n\u201cThe assessment here is that the U.K. leaving would be not only an economic loss, but also a political and geopolitical loss,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a recent analysis, the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German research institute, predicted that, economically, Britain itself would suffer the most from a departure. But it concluded that \u201cthe combination of economic and political disadvantages of the U.K. exiting the E.U. would be detrimental for everyone involved.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, many big businesses fret about the risk. In 2013, 45.1 percent of British goods and services exports were to other European Union countries, according to a report by the House of Commons Library.\n\nOne worry is that, outside the bloc, Britain would have no influence over the European regulations that companies would ultimately have to comply with in order to trade with the rest of Europe.\n\nA European Union without Britain would be a different place, because the departure of a relatively big, free-market nation would alter its balance of power.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven a debate over a British exit would most likely encourage anti-European Union parties across a bloc in which support for the longstanding European goal of deeper integration can no longer be assumed.\n\nGreece is teetering on the edge of default, prompting debate over whether the country \u2014 and the European Union \u2014 might be better off if it left the euro. In France, the far-right National Front wants to quit the euro, and anti-European Union parties are well established in several countries, including the Netherlands. Even in Germany, the bulwark of European integration, a small party, the Alternative for Germany, has made gains by opposing the euro.\n\nDespite the ramifications, Europe has featured little in a British election campaign dominated by the economy, the National Health Service and interminable speculation about political deals that may follow if, as opinion polls suggest, there is no outright winner on Thursday.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the issue resonates much less among voters, for whom it routinely ranks well below the economy, health or education as concerns.\n\nYet if Mr. Cameron remains prime minister, he will have to deliver his promised \u201cin or out\u201d referendum. Under pressure from those in the right wing of the Conservative Party and the populist U.K. Independence Party, which supports a withdrawal from Europe, Mr. Cameron describes a referendum as a \u201cred line\u201d in any postelection deal.\n\n\u201cI will not be prime minister of a government that does not deliver that referendum,\u201d he told the BBC on Sunday.\n\nIf he fails to win a majority, Mr. Cameron may seek support from Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which also favors a referendum, or from the centrist Liberal Democrats, whose leader, Nick Clegg, has carefully not ruled one out.\n\nPhoto\n\nBefore a referendum, Mr. Cameron wants to negotiate sufficient changes to the terms of Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union to recommend staying in.\n\nHis main concern appears to be immigration. Mr. Cameron has spoken of restricting welfare payments for Europeans who can come to Britain because the bloc guarantees the citizens of member states free movement across European borders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut his demands so far remain vague, and he will need the agreement of all the other 27 member states for any fundamental changes in European policy. His ambition of getting changes written into a treaty looks impossible to achieve by 2017. And even if he gets the deal he wants, there can be no guarantee that all in his party would support it, or that he could persuade voters to remain part of the European Union.\n\nThough some polls suggest that Britain would vote to stay, opinion is volatile, and previous surveys have shown a clear majority in favor of leaving.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party is against staging a plebiscite now, but it says it would hold one if there were another European Union treaty that transferred further powers away from the British government. That is unlikely during the next five years, but it might be difficult to postpone indefinitely.\n\nBy refusing to hold a quick referendum, Ed Miliband, the Labour Party leader, has won support from some who are for the European Union and from big business, which is otherwise skeptical of Mr. Miliband\u2019s interventionist economic instincts.\n\nBut some believe that, ultimately, Britain is more likely to remain a member of the European Union if the Conservatives form the next government and hold their referendum.\n\n\u201cYou would have the U.K. heavily distracted, almost out of the game, for two years while it focuses on that referendum,\u201d said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House. \u201cBut you have in my view \u2014 though I know it\u2019s debatable \u2014 an above 50 percent chance that Britain would vote to stay in.\u201d\n\nHowever, were Mr. Cameron to lose the election and resign, the Conservative Party might well drift to the right and elect a more anti-Europe leader, creating a more difficult environment for any future vote.\n\n\u201cEd Miliband has promised an in-or-out referendum, he\u2019s just put tougher conditions,\u201d Mr. Niblett said. \u201cAt some point, in my opinion, those conditions are going to come to pass.\u201d"}
