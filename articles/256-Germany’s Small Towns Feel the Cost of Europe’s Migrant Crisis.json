The issue is feeding into nationalistic sentiments and politics.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Thursday, prompted by the deaths of more than 1,500 people who drowned at sea this year while trying to reach the Continent, European leaders will try to figure out a way to stanch the flow of refugees fleeing the disintegration of Syria and Libya, or from farther places like Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Mali. The meeting is expected to focus on the burdens the influx has placed on Italy, Greece, Spain and other parts of southern Europe.\n\nBut in a quieter way, northern Europe has also been feeling the strain. On May 8, German leaders will hold their own talks in Berlin to address a growing plea from mayors across the country for money and assistance in carrying out the federal mandate for each of Germany\u2019s 16 states to take their share of migrants, and figure out how to make room for them.\n\n\u201cWealthy Germany can afford to help,\u201d said Volker Herzog, the mayor of Vorra. The local pastor, the Rev. Bj\u00f6rn Schukat, said that instead, there was a tendency among the authorities higher up the chain to simply announce that, for example, a dozen refugees are arriving \u2014 \u201cand now you get on with it.\u201d\n\nBehind the worries is a government policy that calls on the 82 million people of Europe\u2019s biggest economy to be generous, particularly in taking in tens of thousands of Syrians. The federal and state authorities apportion the quotas and, increasingly, pay to renovate or rent apartments before sending the people to localities.\n\nThere is widespread understanding that Germany\u2019s Nazi past and current wealth impose a particular obligation to accommodate those fleeing hardship and war. But the costs are being felt as social workers grapple with overcrowded reception centers and officials scramble to house asylum seekers while applications grind through Germany\u2019s complex bureaucracy.\n\nThe federal authorities have already loosened employment restrictions to allow new arrivals to work after three months if they can do so without violating varying rules that stipulate states or regions where they can reside.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccepting asylum seekers \u201cis a common concern for everyone in Germany,\u201d Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian sister party in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, said this month. As governor of Bavaria, with its large rural areas, he emphasized, \u201cwe will not leave the communities alone to cope.\u201d\n\nDENMARK 100 miles North Sea Berlin NETH. GERMANY Tr\u00f6glitz CZECH REP. Vorra FRANCE\n\nBut this region, known as central Franconia, has three social workers for a current allocation of 1,000 migrants. It could use 10, said Pastor Schukat in Vorra.\n\nIt was only last December that the federal authorities allocated an extra billion euros to the states and smaller communities to care for refugees this year and next. Just three weeks ago, Berlin was rebuffing calls for more. Now, more money is expected to flow from federal coffers after Ms. Merkel gathers with officials and politicians on May 8.\n\nIn 2014, some 627,000 people applied for asylum in a European Union country, including 203,000 in Germany. That was more than anywhere else in the bloc, but proportionally, Germany ranked No. 8, with 2.5 asylum applicants per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with 8.4 per thousand in Sweden.\n\nIn a recent German poll, more than half the respondents said they thought there was strong hostility to foreigners in the country.\n\nThe concern that Germany is inhospitable was also expressed this winter in pro-immigration demonstrations held nationwide to counter swelling anti-immigration marches, above all in Dresden.\n\nThe arson attacks in Vorra and Tr\u00f6glitz sent a signal that alarmed official Germany, ever conscious of the past.\n\n\u201cWe should not be surprised that our partners in the world note with great concern when refugee shelters burn in Germany, and that people follow exactly how German society is reacting,\u201d the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told Die Welt a week after the attack in Tr\u00f6glitz.\n\nBut just as European statements do little for the Italian Coast Guard members recovering bodies in the Mediterranean, pronouncements from Berlin may not help German mayors struggling with the refugee issue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWeeks before the arson attack, the mayor of Tr\u00f6glitz, Markus Nierth, quit after far-right marchers opposed to the housing of migrants demonstrated outside his house. At least half a dozen politicians, from big city districts to tiny towns, subsequently told the German news media of right-wing harassment and even death threats.\n\nIn a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Nierth said he was glad the federal authorities now seemed willing to do more, particularly financially. \u201cIt is really hard to make clear to some people that there is no money for a kindergarten or a swimming pool, but there is money to put up refugees,\u201d he said. If the state or federal government absorbed the cost, hostility to refugees would diminish, he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He has spent his life in this valley and is still rattled by the night of Dec. 12, when his panicked deputy called to report that the new refugee shelter was on fire.\n\nDaylight revealed the extent of the damage, estimated at \u20ac700,000, and two swastikas daubed in red alongside a slogan, \u201cNo to asylum seekers in Vorra.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was speechless,\u201d Mr. Herzog said. \u201cWhat was really so bad was that only two weeks earlier, there had been an open day\u201d where everyone \u201cseemed really happy that a bit of life would return\u201d to a long-closed guesthouse that was renovated for about 40 refugees.\n\n\u201cFrom one night to the next morning,\u201d he sighed, showing a visitor the damage, \u201ceverything was destroyed.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nVorra is a meticulous place: Lace curtains hang the same length to the millimeter, logs are stacked in orderly piles and the church graveyard is strikingly well maintained. The community is small, and any outsider is instantly recognized as such.\n\nBut on a recent afternoon, Helga Herbst, 53, and her husband, Peter, 61, were among several residents who said that asylum seekers would be welcome.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere has always been a good deal of contact with nonresidents, and no fear of such contact,\u201d Mr. Herzog said. Despite the swastikas, he was reluctant to attribute the arson attack to rightists. \u201cAnyone can paint a symbol on a wall,\u201d he said.\n\nRepairs are underway, though it will be fall at the earliest before about 30 refugees can be received.\n\nPastor Schukat noted that adjoining villages had already absorbed a few dozen refugees, just as villages near Tr\u00f6glitz had.\n\nAsked whether the higher authorities were leaving small communities to cope as they can, Pastor Schukat was cautious. \u201cYes and no,\u201d he said. \u201cThe great advantage we have is that it really is possible to integrate these people. In a big city, if there are 100 new arrivals, it doesn\u2019t really hit home in a big way. Here, you really notice if you have 30 more people to deal with.\u201d In the best-case scenario, he said, everyone integrates \u201cin a good, lasting and reasonable way.\u201d\n\nCoping with change brought on by once-remote global crises has encouraged inhabitants to overcome fears of strangers, the pastor insisted. \u201cVorra is an absolutely normal village,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 100,000 like it in Germany.\u201d", "summary": "Similar tensions, and even acts of violence, have emerged elsewhere in Europe \u2014 including in Sweden, where fires and vandalism were reported at mosques \u2014 amid anti-immigrant marches and heightened questions on everything from the worthiness of migrants to the soundness of immigration policies.On Thursday, prompted by the deaths of more than 1,500 people who drowned at sea this year while trying to reach the Continent, European leaders will try to figure out a way to stanch the flow of refugees fleeing the disintegration of Syria and Libya, or from farther places like Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Mali.On May 8, German leaders will hold their own talks in Berlin to address a growing plea from mayors across the country for money and assistance in carrying out the federal mandate for each of Germany\u2019s 16 states to take their share of migrants, and figure out how to make room for them.Accepting asylum seekers \u201cis a common concern for everyone in Germany,\u201d Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian sister party in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, said this month.\u201cWe should not be surprised that our partners in the world note with great concern when refugee shelters burn in Germany, and that people follow exactly how German society is reacting,\u201d the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told Die Welt a week after the attack in Tr\u00f6glitz."}
