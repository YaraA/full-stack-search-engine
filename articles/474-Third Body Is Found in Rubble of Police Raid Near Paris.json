If confirmed, the video suggests that Mr. Abaaoud had been not only an organizer of the attacks, but also a participant.\n\nOn Friday, a lawyer for Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s father, Omar, said he had expressed dismay that his son had not been captured alive, because the family wanted to learn what had happened to a younger son who had been lured to fight for the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cHe was expecting for the raid to end very badly,\u201d the lawyer, Nathalie Gallant, told reporters in Brussels. Abdelhamid Abaaoud had persuaded his brother Younes, then 13, to join him in Syria.\n\nOmar Abaaoud\u2019s \u201conly regret is that they didn\u2019t capture him alive so that they could interrogate him,\u201d Ms. Gallant said. \u201cThe father hoped to understand how his son could have gone off the tracks, understand why he took Younes with him, where Younes is, and whether he\u2019s still alive or whether he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMoroccan news agencies reported on Friday that another brother, Yassine, who is in jail in Morocco, tipped off Moroccan security services that Abdelhamid was not in Syria \u2014 as French intelligence agencies initially believed \u2014 but rather in France, leading intelligence agencies to the apartment in St.-Denis.\n\nA senior Moroccan diplomat declined to comment on those reports, saying only that the cooperation between the French and Moroccan intelligence and security services was \u201cvery strong,\u201d and that officials in both countries were working together on the investigation in \u201ca very serious and efficient way.\u201d\n\nOne of the many unanswered questions in the investigation is the identity of a suicide bomber who entered Greece on Oct. 3 by presenting himself as a refugee with a Syrian passport \u2014 probably fake or stolen \u2014 and detonated his vest outside the French soccer stadium in St.-Denis. Compounding the mystery, the French authorities concluded on Friday, based on fingerprint analysis, that a second suicide bomber outside the stadium also entered Greece on Oct. 3.
