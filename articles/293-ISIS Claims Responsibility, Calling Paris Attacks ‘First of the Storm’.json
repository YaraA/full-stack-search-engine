As in that case, it made the announcement in multiple languages and audio recordings.\n\nLatest Updates\n\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France said on Saturday that the Islamic State was responsible. Analysts said the nature of the attacks was more in keeping with actions of the Islamic State than with those of Al Qaeda, and the timing and extent of the celebration expressed online by the group\u2019s supporters added weight to the claim.\n\n\u201cEight brothers, wrapped in explosive belts and armed with machine rifles, targeted sites that were accurately chosen in the heart of the capital of France,\u201d the group said in the statement, \u201cincluding the Stade de France during the match between the Crusader German and French teams, where the fool of France, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, was present.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet France and those who walk in its path know that they will remain on the top of the list of targets of the Islamic State,\u201d the statement added, referring to the attacks at the Bataclan concert hall and elsewhere in Paris.\n\nThe style of the attack was in line with the Islamic State\u2019s tactic of indiscriminate killings and goes against Al Qaeda\u2019s guidelines. In a 2013 directive, the leader of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri, stated that Qaeda operatives should avoid attacks that could inadvertently cause the death of Muslim civilians and noncombatant women or children.\n\nHe argued that targeting markets, for example, was unadvisable because innocent Muslims might accidentally be killed.\n\nAlthough Qaeda branches have deviated from these guidelines on numerous occasions, their attacks reflect more carefully defined targeting. That was the case in the killings at the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris in January, when cartoonists were singled out and defined as legitimate targets because of what the group considered to be blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nA Dutch fighter for Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria commented on the distinction in a series of posts on Twitter. \u201cAl Qaeda focuses mostly on political & military targets instead of civilians. That\u2019s why this could be an I.S. attack,\u201d wrote the fighter, who goes by the name Abu Saeed Al-Halabi.\n\nCelebrations by Islamic State supporters online were such that the SITE monitoring group said they could suggest the Islamic State\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cThe extent of the celebration far exceeded past online rallying by I.S. supporters,\u201d SITE said in an analysis. \u201cThe way I.S. supporters have embraced this attack appears much more coordinated at a much earlier stage than massive reactions to past attacks.\u201d"}
