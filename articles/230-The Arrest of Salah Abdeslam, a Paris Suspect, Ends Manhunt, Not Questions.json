{"title": "The Arrest of Salah Abdeslam, a Paris Suspect, Ends Manhunt, Not Questions", "authors": ["Alissa J. Rubin"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/world/europe/arrest-salah-abdeslam-paris-suspect.html", "body": "In the end, Mr. Abdeslam was captured coming out of a building only 100 yards from where, the police believe, he had hidden immediately after fleeing Paris four months ago and barely a 10-minute walk from his mother\u2019s house, raising further questions about the well-documented shortcomings of Belgium\u2019s counterterrorism efforts.\n\nYet the case has also brought to life the extreme challenge this country faces in addressing the threat from Islamists living in the heart of the European Union\u2019s capital city, as well as the problems that security officials face in penetrating Muslim cultures imported wholesale into Western societies. And it has left some unresolved mysteries in its wake, not least whether Mr. Abdeslam was a frightened young man who got in over his head or a determined terrorist who continued to plot further assaults up until he was captured.\n\nMr. Abdeslam, 26, handled logistics for the Paris attackers. He was the fixer, renting cars, finding apartments, picking people up and dropping them off. Like his brother Ibrahim \u2014 who was among the attackers and blew himself up in a Paris cafe \u2014 he was supposed to die on Nov. 13. Instead, Salah Abdeslam, who told the police that he had wanted to blow himself up at the national soccer stadium north of Paris, lost his nerve and, according to French investigators, made a panicked call to friends in Brussels asking to be picked up and taken home in the hours after the attack, before the authorities learned his identity.\n\nThe neighborhood he returned to, Molenbeek, is a working-class district, where mosques outnumber churches, cafes specialize in scalding hot tea vibrant with fresh mint and many women wear hijab. Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s Molenbeek was an even more insular sub-community, made up of small-time drug dealers and petty criminals, unemployed young men with few prospects.\n\nIt was this Molenbeek that sustained him before and after the attacks. Much of Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s life was spent within a mile of his mother\u2019s house. A half-hour walk away was the bar he and Ibrahim ran until it was closed just two weeks before the attacks. It was a place where young men traded in illegal drugs, drank tea and watched extremist videos of fighting in Syria.\n\nMany of the first- and second-generation immigrants in Molenbeek, especially those living near a canal that separates the district from wealthier central Brussels, have roots, like the Abdeslam family, in Morocco. One of the busiest shops in the area has pay telephone booths for long-distance calls and computers because some Molenbeek residents cannot afford international calling plans or Internet service.\n\nIt can seem at times as if a community has migrated to Belgium with its customs, loyalties and language intact, putting a premium on family ties and fostering an insularity that made finding Mr. Abdeslam that much harder. Johan Leman, an anthropologist who works in Molenbeek, said the atmosphere resembled the culture of omert\u00e0, the code of silence followed by the Mafia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUpon his return from Paris, the authorities said, Mr. Abdeslam went underground, hidden by friends and family, staying mostly in the area but moving around and relying on others to bring him food.\n\n\u201cIt was a pre-existing network that came together to do small time trafficking or other things and it was at least partly used to help in Salah Abdeslam\u2019s flight,\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Van Leeuw, the Belgium federal prosecutor, said on Belgian television on Saturday.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Abdeslam also retained close links while in hiding to other men who appear to have been involved in planning the Paris attacks and possibly trained by the Islamic State in Syria. That association suggests Mr. Abdeslam may not have given up on engaging in further terrorist activities, and that the militants in Belgium had not yet dismissed him as unwilling to give his life for their cause.\n\nThe turning point in the case came last week when the police raided an apartment about six miles from Molenbeek, seeking clues but believing it to be empty.\n\nInstead, they were met with gunfire. They killed the gunman, Mohamed Belkaid, a 35-year-old Algerian who had already been linked to the Paris plot. But two men escaped. And when the police entered the apartment, they found large quantities of ammunition, an Islamic State flag \u2014 and Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s fingerprints.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Around the same time, Mr. Abdeslam appears to have made a big mistake, using a cellphone known to the authorities that he had not used for some time, said Pieter Van Ostaeyen, an expert on extremist networks in Belgium.\n\n\u201cIt was basically because Salah Abdeslam activated his cellphone and the number was known to the police and then they knew his location geographically,\u201d Mr. Van Ostaeyen said.\n\nOn Thursday, Ibrahim Abdeslam was buried in an unmarked grave in an ecumenical cemetery in Brussels, nearly 18 weeks after his death. The short funeral service took place under heavy surveillance, and the 20 men who attended it were identified and most likely being watched by the authorities from then on if they were not already, neighbors said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong the attendees was Abid Aberkan, who Mr. El Khannouss said was a cousin of the Abdeslam brothers. It was to a Molenbeek apartment used by Mr. Aberkan\u2019s family that Mr. Abdeslam went at some point after the raid. And on Friday, the police targeted that apartment in a raid that ended when Mr. Abdeslam sprinted into the street from the doorway, wearing a hoodie; he was shot in the leg by the police and taken into custody.\n\nWhat finally gave Mr. Abdeslam away, a spokesman for the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said, was a combination of \u201ctelephony and surveillance.\u201d\n\nMr. Abdeslam began talking to interrogators over the weekend, and France is seeking his extradition. It remains unclear how ideologically committed he was to the Islamic State, the terrorist group also known as ISIS and ISIL. His role went unmentioned in the organization\u2019s social media propaganda after the Paris attacks. There is no evidence that he tried to get to Syria. Mr. El Khannouss, the Molenbeek deputy mayor, described him as someone \u201ctrying to fill shoes that were too big for him.\u201d\n\nYet up until his capture, Mr. Abdeslam appears to have been among more hardened jihadists. Mr. Belkaid, the Algerian killed in the gunfight with the police, is suspected of wiring money to help finance the Paris plot.\n\nAs the police were capturing Mr. Abdeslam on Friday, they were arresting a man whose real name they do not know yet, but since they also found false papers during the raid in the name of Amine Choukri and another set in the name of Monir Ahmed Alaaj, it is possible that he was using one or both of those names.\n\nMr. Abdeslam, who traveled to Budapest twice last fall before the Paris attacks to pick up several men at a time when tens of thousands of undocumented migrants were streaming through Europe each week, was stopped by the police in October in Germany with a man traveling under the name Amine Choukri.\n\nOn Monday, the Belgian authorities identified another man they suspect of being an accomplice of Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s: Najim Laachraoui, 24, a Belgian citizen who went to Syria in February 2013. Mr. Laachraoui, using the name Soufiane Kayal, was one of two men \u2014 Mr. Belkaid was the other \u2014 with fake Belgian identity cards who were with Mr. Abdeslam on Sept. 9 as they passed through a checkpoint between Hungary and Austria.\n\nIn Molenbeek\u2019s teahouses, it is hard to get anyone to say much about Mr. Abdeslam or his capture. Men walk outside rather than speak to outsiders.\n\nThat does not make them jihad supporters, said Mr. Leman, the anthropologist. \u201cEven if they disapprove of what someone did in family,\u201d he said, \u201cthey feel it should be dealt with internally.\u201d", "summary": "In the end, Mr. Abdeslam was captured coming out of a building only 100 yards from where, the police believe, he had hidden immediately after fleeing Paris four months ago and barely a 10-minute walk from his mother\u2019s house, raising further questions about the well-documented shortcomings of Belgium\u2019s counterterrorism efforts.Instead, Salah Abdeslam, who told the police that he had wanted to blow himself up at the national soccer stadium north of Paris, lost his nerve and, according to French investigators, made a panicked call to friends in Brussels asking to be picked up and taken home in the hours after the attack, before the authorities learned his identity.The neighborhood he returned to, Molenbeek, is a working-class district, where mosques outnumber churches, cafes specialize in scalding hot tea vibrant with fresh mint and many women wear hijab.It can seem at times as if a community has migrated to Belgium with its customs, loyalties and language intact, putting a premium on family ties and fostering an insularity that made finding Mr. Abdeslam that much harder.\u201cIt was a pre-existing network that came together to do small time trafficking or other things and it was at least partly used to help in Salah Abdeslam\u2019s flight,\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Van Leeuw, the Belgium federal prosecutor, said on Belgian television on Saturday."}
