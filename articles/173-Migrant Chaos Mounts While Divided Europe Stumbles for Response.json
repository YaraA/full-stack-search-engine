She urged others to do their part, with \u201cquotas and rules that are fair and take into account what is possible in each country.\u201d\n\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France said he had reached agreement with Ms. Merkel on \u201ca permanent and obligatory mechanism\u201d to allocate migrants across the bloc, saying, \u201cI believe that today what exists is no longer enough. We will need to go further.\u201d But there is no consensus. Mr. Orban rejected the idea of mandatory quotas, as did the Slovak government, which said it would accept only Christians, and in small numbers.\n\nPhoto\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron of Britain at first rejected the idea of mandatory quotas, but late Thursday said that \u201cas a father I felt deeply moved\u201d by the boy\u2019s death and that Britain would fulfill its \u201cmoral responsibilities.\u201d He gave no details, though there were suggestions it might take more Syrians from camps in the region.\n\nWhile politicians searched for answers, migrants continue to pile up in Hungary, particularly at the 19th century Keleti railroad station in the capital, Budapest. After a day of turmoil and a night sleeping on platforms and floors, nearly 500 migrants trapped there were finally allowed to board a train.\n\nFights broke out in some train cars as migrants pushed and clawed their way inside, believing they were on their way, at last, to Austria and Germany.\n\n\u201cWhere is this train going?\u201d asked a Syrian man. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to Germany, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this is a local, man,\u201d someone answered as he walked past the train. \u201cIt\u2019s going to the camps.\u201d That was a reference to reports the migrants would be sent to reception centers to register and file asylum requests, a procedure that can take months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout a half-hour to the west of Budapest, the reports and rumors turned out to have some truth. An intercity train with about 500 migrants on board was stopped in the town of Bicske, the site of an already overwhelmed camp. Buses idled nearby, seemingly waiting to take the migrants to a Hungarian camp.\n\nAll Hungarians were told they could get off, but non-Hungarians remained locked inside the train without drinking water. Riot police officers fended off migrants hanging out of windows and chanting that they wanted to go to Austria and Germany.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe migrants initially refused to get off, believing they were being tricked by the authorities. \u201cNo camp, no camp,\u201d people shouted from the train.\n\nEventually, the migrants left the train and huddled on the platform, kept there by the police, who blocked the exits.\n\nHungary has emerged as a potent symbol of Europe\u2019s struggle to come to terms with the migration crisis, as well as its lack of preparedness to cope with an influx of migrants from Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nThe migrants have no desire to stay in the country, where Mr. Orban\u2019s center-right government has made it abundantly clear they are unwelcome, and would prefer to travel to Germany.\n\nUnder European Union rules, however, migrants are supposed to file for asylum in the country where they enter, before moving on to their final destination. In practice, the migrants are often given no final destinations and become the responsibility of the country that registered them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter first encouraging migrants to pass through the country, he changed course on Thursday, following the letter of the law while complaining that the system was broken.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWe Hungarians are full of fear,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople in Europe are full of fear, because we see that European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not capable of controlling the situation.\u201d\n\nGermany has promised to be generous in accepting asylum-seekers, especially from Syria, but made it clear that it cannot accept everyone forever, and that the burden must be shared by other E.U. states.\n\nTo try to get around the problem, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, whose proposal for mandatory quotas was rejected in June, is considering allowing some countries to provide money instead of taking migrants. The European Commission is preparing proposals for setting up reception and screening centers in Italy and Greece and is making another effort at pushing member states to share the burden.\n\nBut in a fashion typical of the bloc, the process is cumbersome and slow. Only after a preparatory meeting of interior and justice ministers on Sept. 14 will a summit meeting of European leaders be considered.\n\nThe numbers, of course, are not the biggest issue \u2014 for Mr. Orban and some others, it is the cultural and religious dimension that troubles them.\n\nHis country, he said, was being \u201coverrun\u201d with asylum-seekers, most of whom are Muslim. \u201cThat is an important question, because Europe and European culture have Christian roots,\u201d he wrote in the German newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\nUnaware of what was going on in Bicske, migrants continued to surge into Keleti after the authorities relaxed their cordon. Officers \u201cleft and let people come into the station, but now they\u2019re back,\u201d said Mohammad al-Bekaai, a 23-year-old Syrian. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pen these people inside and take them to the camp.\u201d\n\nA handful managed to get onto the next few trains headed west, but they were removed at Bicske and joined the few who had left the morning train and moved onto the platform.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome, realizing the authorities were determined to send them to reception centers, were resigned. \u201cEven if they take us to the camp, it\u2019s better than staying in the station,\u201d said Ali al-Taai, a Syrian from Deir al-Zour. \u201cI\u2019ve been there for six days without food and water. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d", "summary": "The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected Mr. Orban\u2019s assertions, saying Germany was doing only what \u201cis morally and legally required\u201d of every European Union country in accepting its fair share of the migrants.
