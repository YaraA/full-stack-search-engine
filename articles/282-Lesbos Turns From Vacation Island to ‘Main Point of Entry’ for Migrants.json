Turkey is so close that migrants have to cross as few as six miles of water to reach the island. And nearby Turkish shores are sparsely inhabited, making them ideal places for human traffickers to gather migrants and launch them in flimsy inflatable rafts.\n\nWhile other Greek islands, like Kos and Khios, are also close to Turkey, the waters around Lesbos are relatively calm, making the crossing easier. And the maritime authorities in Turkey have cracked down on human smuggling farther south, according to Syrian smugglers in Turkey.\n\nVideo\n\nThat crackdown has not been as strict near Lesbos, where arrivals have skyrocketed to more than 50,000 last month from 737 in January, Mr. Sofiadelis said.\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,500 migrants now reach the island daily, riding on about 100 inflatable rafts. That is too many for the island\u2019s 180 coast guard officers to handle, and many now work double shifts and carry out rescue operations when rafts pop or motors malfunction, stranding the migrants at sea.\n\nFor most migrants, who are coming from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, Lesbos is a mere way station on the way to mainland Greece and farther afield in Europe, although the island\u2019s isolation has at times hindered that journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarlier this month, a rise in arrivals and slow registrations led to a backup of more than 20,000 migrants on the island, nearly a quarter of its native population. The migrants protested the lack of services, blocking traffic and clashing with the police.\n\nThe Greek government has since streamlined registration and hired extra passenger ferries to get migrants to the mainland, said Djamal Zamzoum of the United Nations refugee agency on Lesbos.\n\nSitting in his office on this city\u2019s U-shaped harbor, Spyros Galinos, the mayor of Lesbos, said he felt the island had been occupied by migrants.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Still, he said, the migrants had taxed municipal resources, causing 1 million euros, or about $1.1 million, in damages to infrastructure and exhausting the municipality\u2019s yearly sanitation budget four months early.\n\nThe impact of the migrants is clear around town.\n\nDuring the day, the streets are full of migrants speaking a variety of languages, lugging large backpacks and charging their phones for a fee at impromptu charging stations in cafes. Long lines form outside shops selling cheap gyros and in front of ferry company offices.\n\nSince most of the new arrivals are Muslims, the bars are suffering, while vendors of cigarettes and SIM cards are doing swift business. One recent morning, the central offices of two major cellphone companies ran out of SIM cards after selling them to migrants using smartphones to plot journeys across Europe.\n\nAt night, those with money return to hotels that are booked to capacity, while others bed down on sheets of cardboard on the sidewalk that rings the harbor.\n\nMany Lesbos residents sympathize with the migrants even while suffering from the lack of tourism income that their presence has caused. Many tour operators have canceled stops in Lesbos, adding to the economy\u2019s already dire state.\n\nIgnatios Psouhlos, 52, a Lesbos native who waits tables at a waterfront fish restaurant, said that business this summer had been about 40 percent lower than the year before, hurting many locals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt angered him to see the arrivals clashing with the police, he said, and the presence of so many Muslims made him nervous.\n\n\u201cI see their women are covered, and then they want to come here and have rights,\u201d he said.\n\nBut each day brings more.\n\nMr. Salem, the Syrian who scrambled ashore on Wednesday, said he had fled his hometown after it was taken over by the jihadists of the Islamic State. He then worked in construction in Turkey for nine months, earning poor wages. So he decided to leave and paid a smuggler to get him on a raft to Lesbos.\n\nHis goal was to get to Austria, where he said he had friends.\n\n\u201cI have friends in America, too, but that is hard in a raft,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers come with more resources. At an upscale restaurant in town, a group of young Syrian men drank cola and played cards, killing time before the ferry that was to take them to Athens that night. One of them, who gave only his first name, Fayez, said he had earned his dentistry degree in the Syrian city of Aleppo last year and had begun working but then decided to flee because the city was so dangerous.\n\nHe hoped to get to France and continue his career.\n\n\u201cIt is a journey, a kind of tourism, but we do it illegally,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nAmid the migrants on the street outside passed two tourists in shorts and sandals, riding bicycles. They had flown in from London and were meeting friends to go sailing but wanted to explore town first, said one, Marek Mroziewicz, an architect.\n\nHe said seeing the migrants in Lesbos affected him in a way that seeing them on television hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe sad part is that there is no solution,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are still coming.\u201d", "summary": "After sunrise on Wednesday, Safa Salem, a refugee from eastern Syria, stepped from a rubber raft stuffed with dozens of passengers and stood in Europe for the first time.
