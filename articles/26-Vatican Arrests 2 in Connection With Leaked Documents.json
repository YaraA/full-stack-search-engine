Lucio \u00c1ngel Vallejo Balda and Francesca Chaouqui, a laywoman \u2014 were members of that commission, which was dissolved last year after completing its mandate.\n\nMonsignor Vallejo Balda holds one of the top posts at the Vatican\u2019s prefecture for economic affairs. Ms. Chaouqui is a public relations specialist. They were taken into custody by the Vatican police over the weekend, the Vatican said in a statement. Ms. Chaouqui was released Monday after she agreed to cooperate with the investigation, the Vatican said.\n\nDivulging confidential documents has been considered a crime in the Vatican since July 2013, after the leak of a cache of Vatican documents, including personal papers belonging to Benedict, which Mr. Nuzzi published in a best seller, \u201cSua Santit\u00e0,\u201d or \u201cHis Holiness.\u201d\n\nAfter the publication of that book, the pope\u2019s personal butler, Paolo Gabriele, was arrested on charges of leaking the documents to Mr. Nuzzi. Mr. Gabriele was tried and was sentenced in October 2012 to 18 months in prison. He was pardoned two months later by Benedict.\n\nThe revelations of widespread infighting and power struggles at the Vatican are considered to have helped precipitate Benedict\u2019s resignation. Echoes of that scandal, called \u201cVatiLeaks\u201d by the news media, reverberated last month when an Italian newspaper announced that Pope Francis had a treatable brain tumor, a report that the Vatican denied and called an attempt to undermine him.\n\nThe Vatican said Monday that the coming books were \u201cthe fruit of a grave betrayal of the pope\u2019s trust.\u201d The authors of the books have been warned that the Vatican\u2019s legal offices are considering action.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cPublications of this kind do not contribute in any way to the establishment of clarity and truth, but rather to the creation of confusion and partial and tendentious interpretations,\u201d the Vatican said in the statement. \u201cWe must absolutely avoid the mistake of thinking that this is a way to help the mission of the pope.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Fittipaldi, the author of \u201cAvarice\u201d and an investigative journalist for the newsweekly L\u2019Espresso, called the arrests on Monday \u201cabnormal\u201d and said it was no coincidence that they had taken place just before the publication of two books that probe the inner workings of one of the world\u2019s most secretive institutions.\n\n\u201cThe arrests are a way not to talk about the content of the books, but about moles and intrigue, and whether they are the sources or not,\u201d Mr. Fittipaldi said in a telephone interview.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Fittipaldi declined to give details from his book before its publication, but he noted that he had looked into the lavish lifestyles of cardinals, and financial investments in companies in the United States and Luxembourg.\n\nBesides reporting on the church\u2019s vast financial holdings, Mr. Fittipaldi said he had also discovered that money given to the church for the poor was used for other purposes.\n\nThe bottom line, he said, was that in the Vatican \u201cthere is still considerable resistance against Francis\u2019 revolution.\u201d\n\nMr. Nuzzi\u2019s book, which will be published in several countries on Thursday, claims to \u201ctell from the inside\u201d the struggles that Francis and his closest advisers are undertaking to overhaul the church, based on \u201cunpublished documents and tape recordings,\u201d according to a news release.\n\nThe book suggests that the Vatican\u2019s finances were in such chaos that Benedict had no choice but to resign. The book also promises to reveal the \u201cpoisons of those who would sabotage the pope\u2019s vigorous revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am certainly surprised that the Vatican responds to the imminent publication of a book with handcuffs,\u201d Mr. Nuzzi said in a telephone interview on Monday, particularly \u201cwhen handcuffs aren\u2019t used to stop the thieves in the Vatican.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI understand the book is embarrassing, but that should concern the people who acted wrongly, not those who publish the wrongdoings.\u201d\n\nThe book describes \u201cdramatic stories, of a Curia that couldn\u2019t be farther from Francis\u2019 words,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people in the Vatican who don\u2019t want him to reform. I say who those people are, who is trying to stop him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Nuzzi said that as an Italian, he felt the Vatican could not pursue him legally. \u201cIn Italy, the publication of news is protected by the Constitution,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Lucio \u00c1ngel Vallejo Balda and Francesca Chaouqui, a laywoman \u2014 were members of that commission, which was dissolved last year after completing its mandate.
