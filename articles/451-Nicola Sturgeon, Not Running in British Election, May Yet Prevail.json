In one exchange, she challenged the head of the populist United Kingdom Independence Party, Nigel Farage, after he blamed immigrants for a housing crisis.\n\nImmigrants \u201cmake a net contribution to our country,\u201d she told Mr. Farage. \u201cSo if we can maybe just put the boogeyman to one side, we can actually debate these issues for real and in substance,\u201d she continued, to thunderous applause.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing \u2014 \u2014\u201d a shocked Mr. Farage began.\n\n\u201cYou are, yes,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon retorted, to more cheers.\n\nVideo\n\nAfter she explained to a national audience why she wanted a higher minimum wage, more spending on health and child care and an end to steep budget cuts, people outside Scotland suddenly wanted to know if they could vote for her party.\n\nThey cannot. Her party is fielding candidates only in Scotland. But with neither the Conservatives nor Labour expected to win a majority, Ms. Sturgeon could well determine the shape of the next British government \u2014 or whether one can be formed at all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhatever the outcome, the winner of this election is called Nicola Sturgeon,\u201d said David Torrance, the author of a new biography of her.\n\nThe polls suggest that her party, which has only six seats in Westminster now, may win at least 45 \u2014 which could be enough to give Labour a majority if the two parties are willing to work together.\n\nSo far, Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, has ruled out setting up a formal coalition, suggesting that he expects the Scottish Nationalists to support his agenda in any case. The two parties have similar economic platforms, though they differ sharply on some other issues, like nuclear disarmament and Scottish independence.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Ms. Sturgeon says that Labour cannot be trusted to make Britain a fairer country on its own. \u201cWe can bring an influence to bear on Ed Miliband and a Labour government to make them more progressive,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThere is as much of an appetite for political change in England as there is in Scotland,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe fact that neither Labour nor the Tories are ahead in the polls reflects the fact that people think they haven\u2019t got much of a choice.\u201d\n\nThe right-leaning tabloid The Daily Mail has called her \u201cthe most dangerous woman in British politics.\u201d Prime Minister David Cameron has described a possible coalition with her as \u201ca match made in hell.\u201d The Conservative mayor of London, Boris Johnson, likened her to a scorpion and said that allowing her party into a coalition government would be like putting King Herod in charge of a baby farm.\n\nOne Conservative campaign poster shows Mr. Miliband peeking out of Ms. Sturgeon\u2019s pocket. Another has her as his puppet master.\n\nMs. Sturgeon shrugs off the vitriol. \u201cPeople only try and shoot at you if you\u2019re worth shooting at,\u201d she said. Noting that her party has been in government in Scotland since 2007 and won a majority there in 2011, she said, \u201cIf the S.N.P. wasn\u2019t doing well, nobody would be bothering about us.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, each English insult seems to strengthen her in Scotland.\n\n\u201cEvery time David Cameron or Ed Miliband says something stupid, there is a surge in party membership,\u201d said Heather McLean, 59, a former Labour voter from Dundee who joined the Scottish Nationalists during the independence referendum campaign last year. \u201cAnd they do that quite a lot, you know, say something stupid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe referendum galvanized voters on both sides of the independence debate, drawing nearly 85 percent of Scottish voters to the polls, the highest turnout in any British election in a century. Membership in the Scottish National Party has quadrupled.\n\nEven The Sun, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s tabloid, which is backing the Conservatives elsewhere, has jumped on the nationalist bandwagon in Scotland. Its Scottish edition depicted Ms. Sturgeon as a light-saber-wielding Princess Leia from \u201cStar Wars\u201d and told readers it was \u201ctime to vote S.N.P.\u201d\n\nMs. Sturgeon was delighted. \u201cIf I cast my mind back a decade, the idea of any tabloid newspaper endorsing the S.N.P. would have seemed a bit fanciful,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen she joined the party as a teenager, it was a fringe group with three seats in the national Parliament (Scotland would not have its own legislature for another decade). It took two decades and numerous defeats before she finally won election to the Scottish Parliament. When she took her seat, she refused to take the traditional oath of allegiance to the queen (though by law she still had to make a \u201csolemn affirmation\u201d to \u201cbear allegiance\u201d to the monarch).\n\nShe was deputy to her formidable but divisive predecessor, Alex Salmond, as deputy party leader, for 10 years. From 2007 to 2014, she was also his deputy first minister in the Scottish government. \u201cSturgeon has worked half her life to become an overnight success,\u201d Ian Jack wrote recently in The Guardian.\n\nBefore boarding the helicopter to continue her 15-stop campaign tour, Ms. Sturgeon insisted that the election was not about Scottish independence but about making politics more progressive across Britain. But as the helicopter\u2019s doors closed and the large letters of her campaign motto came into full view, there was little doubt about her first loyalty: \u201cStronger for Scotland,\u201d it said.", "summary": "Judging by opinion polls, she is all but certain to emerge as a national political force, commanding the third-largest bloc of seats in Parliament and ending the Labour Party\u2019s long dominance in Scotland.In one exchange, she challenged the head of the populist United Kingdom Independence Party, Nigel Farage, after he blamed immigrants for a housing crisis.So far, Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, has ruled out setting up a formal coalition, suggesting that he expects the Scottish Nationalists to support his agenda in any case.\u201cEvery time David Cameron or Ed Miliband says something stupid, there is a surge in party membership,\u201d said Heather McLean, 59, a former Labour voter from Dundee who joined the Scottish Nationalists during the independence referendum campaign last year.Before boarding the helicopter to continue her 15-stop campaign tour, Ms. Sturgeon insisted that the election was not about Scottish independence but about making politics more progressive across Britain."}
