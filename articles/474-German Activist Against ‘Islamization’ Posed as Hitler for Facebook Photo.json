The group has held weekly rallies in Dresden that attract up to 25,000 demonstrators. Opponents of the protest movement have derided its leaders as racists and neo-Nazis.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe wolf has taken off his sheepskin,\u201d Ulla Jelpke, a leftist member of the German Parliament, told the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine. No one who takes part in Pegida\u2019s rallies, she added, can now say that they were unaware of their \u201cracist\u201d undercurrent.\n\nMr. Bachmann acknowledged to Bild that he had posted the image, along with the caption \u201cHe\u2019s Back.\u201d But he argued that it was merely a joke, inspired by the success of a satirical novel about Hitler returning to modern Germany, \u201cLook Who\u2019s Back.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven so, a spokeswoman for Pegida, Kathrin Oertel, told news agencies late on Wednesday that Mr. Bachmann would step down from his leadership role in the movement as a result of the controversy over the image."}
