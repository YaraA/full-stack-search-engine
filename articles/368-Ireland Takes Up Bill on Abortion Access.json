But in the 20 years since the decision in the \u201cX Case,\u201d successive governments have shied away from enacting the legislation needed to carry out the order.\n\nThe proposed measure would provide \u201cfor termination of pregnancy where a real and substantial risk to the life of the pregnant woman exists.\u201d The bill\u2019s sponsor, an opposition Socialist Party deputy, Clare Daly, said it was long overdue.\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is only a first step for abortion to be legalized in Ireland in all circumstances.
