The separatist leadership clarified Sunday that the cease-fire offer had covered only so-called green routes, or roads used by evacuees.\n\nStill, Ukraine\u2019s outright rebuff of the proposal only added to concerns that Russia would intervene with what the authorities in Moscow are calling a humanitarian mission but what European nations and the United States would view as an invasion, analysts said. Secretary of State John Kerry has cautioned Russia against intervening on the \u201cpretext\u201d of providing aid.\n\nRUSSIA Kiev LUHANSK PROVINCE UKRAINE Horlivka DETAIL Jenakijeve Shakhtyorsk TAPAZ KIEVSKY Torez Hospital No.1 VOROSHYLOVSKY Snizhne Donetsk DONETSK PROVINCE UKRAINE 20 Miles\n\nThrough the day on Sunday, artillery shells rained down on three districts of Donetsk, hitting a rebel checkpoint and leaving it swathed in smoke, but also striking houses, apartment buildings and the maternity ward of the city\u2019s main hospital.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShells killed at least one civilian in the city.
