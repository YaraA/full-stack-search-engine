{"title": "Brussels Attacks Underscore Vulnerability of an Open European Society", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/world/europe/belgium-security.html", "body": "Even before the Belgian authorities captured Salah Abdeslam on Friday for his suspected role in the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, which killed 130 people, they had detained or arrested scores of suspects directly or peripherally connected to what they described as a terrorist network linked to the Islamic State.\n\nBut despite the success in arresting Mr. Abdeslam, Belgium continues to present a special security problem for Europe.\n\nThe country of just 11.2 million people faces widening derision as being the world\u2019s wealthiest failed state \u2014 a worrying mix of deeply rooted terrorist networks; a government weakened by divisions among French, Dutch and German speakers; and an overwhelmed intelligence service in seemingly chronic disarray.\n\nIt is also home to what Bernard Squarcini, a former head of France\u2019s internal intelligence, described as \u201ca favorable ecosystem: an Islamist milieu, and a family milieu,\u201d which played an important role in sheltering Mr. Abdeslam and also perhaps in Tuesday\u2019s attacks.\n\n\u201cIt shows that they were in a neighborhood that can shelter cells for months, because it is a neighborhood that is favorable to them,\u201d he said, referring to Molenbeek, a Brussels district. It is where the Paris attackers lived and where Mr. Abdeslam was able to hide among family and friends.\n\nThe cultural code of silence in the heavily immigrant district, as well as widespread distrust of already weak government authorities, has provided what amounts to a fifth column or forward base for the Islamic State.\n\nFor weeks, intelligence operatives had warned that the next major terrorist attack on European soil was simply a matter of time. Even before Tuesday, Mr. Squarcini predicted that \u201cthere will be an even more serious attack\u201d because, he said, \u201cthere are already the people in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, the presumed orchestrator of the Paris attacks, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who lived in Molenbeek, boasted to his cousin before he was killed that \u201c90\u201d operatives were dormant, ready for another attack.\n\nLatest Updates\n\nSome security and intelligence experts saw Tuesday\u2019s blasts as proof that Europe\u2019s open societies, even under states of emergency, will never be risk-free.\n\nBut the risks are fatally compounded, some said, by European-wide failures in intelligence sharing and the weakness of a Belgian intelligence service that Mr. Squarcini said lacked the capacity to pick up the \u201cweak signals\u201d of emerging plots.\n\n\u201cThe Belgians are too limited to be able to treat several objectives at once,\u201d Mr. Squarcini said in an interview weeks ago.\n\n\u201cAfter a weekend of mutual congratulations\u201d over the arrest of Mr. Abdeslam, he said Tuesday, \u201cmanifestly we didn\u2019t see the second wave.\u201d\n\nBut political and social failures have allowed militant cells to become deeply rooted, experts warned, and they were equally or even more worrying. Belgian officials spent weeks looking for Mr. Abdeslam, yet failed to turn up Tuesday\u2019s bombers.\n\n\u201cThe mode of action was structured and agreed,\u201d said Ralf J\u00e4ger, the interior minister in North Rhine-Westphalia, a German state next to Belgium. \u201cThat presumes the formation of a cell. And that is what is frightening: that such a cell could not be discovered.\u201d\n\nThose who are in place in Europe may now possess improved bomb-making skills and tactics, which can be adapted easily to additional security measures put in place by the police and government authorities.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor instance, striking the check-in counter at the Brussels airport inflicted serious casualties and disrupted air travel while circumventing the millions spent on added security screening before passengers board planes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Squarcini said airport security may now have to be revised Continent-wide, to take in even the approach to check-in counters \u2014 as is already the case in some parts of the world.\n\nOthers emphasized that progressive layers of new security measures can go only so far. Absent a military-style occupation, the threat from a well-established network with some degree of local complicity can never be completely forestalled, experts said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We\u2019re talking about guerrilla terrorism. And there\u2019s a population that\u2019s complicit.\u201d\n\nThat complicity may be most worrying, he and others said. \u201cWe are paying for our na\u00efvet\u00e9,\u201d said Jacques Myard, a French parliamentarian who sits on his country\u2019s intelligence oversight committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not a weakness in intelligence. It\u2019s a weakness in society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sleeper cells have been there, and they are well implanted,\u201d said Mr. Myard, a member of the conservative Republican party. For two years, the intelligence services \u201chave been telling us: We\u2019ve never seen such an influx\u201d of terrorist operatives.\n\nIt was unclear whether Tuesday\u2019s bombings were a response to Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s arrest, or long in the works. In either case, said Alain Juillet, who helped reorganize the French external intelligence service as a top official there, \u201cit\u2019s not surprising.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing one can say,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can easily see that Belgium has become a hub.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSo that when you arrest someone, there will be a reaction,\u201d Mr. Juillet said, referring to Mr. Abdeslam.\n\n\u201cAll of this is to say that the implantation of the network is more firm than we thought,\u201d Mr. Juillet added. \u201cThe police were efficient \u2014 and yet this happened. So, there is a very strong implantation in Belgium.\u201d\n\nBut the fatal paradox for Europe is that on a border-free Continent, such problems play out transnationally. One country\u2019s failures are necessarily amplified.\n\nNow the problems in Belgium are threatening not only lives across Europe, but also the Continent\u2019s experiment at integration. Whether the European Union, with its commitment to open borders, is strong enough to withstand the strains on top of years of economic crisis already is an ever more open question.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the clear targets of the attacks \u2014 an international airport, a metro station close to E.U. institutions \u2014 indicate that this terrorist attack is not aimed solely against Belgium,\u201d Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, said at a news conference in Berlin. \u201cBut against our freedom, freedom of movement, mobility and everyone in the E.U.\u201d", "summary": "The country of just 11.2 million people faces widening derision as being the world\u2019s wealthiest failed state \u2014 a worrying mix of deeply rooted terrorist networks; a government weakened by divisions among French, Dutch and German speakers; and an overwhelmed intelligence service in seemingly chronic disarray.The cultural code of silence in the heavily immigrant district, as well as widespread distrust of already weak government authorities, has provided what amounts to a fifth column or forward base for the Islamic State.For instance, striking the check-in counter at the Brussels airport inflicted serious casualties and disrupted air travel while circumventing the millions spent on added security screening before passengers board planes.\u201cThis shows the limits of the actions you can undertake in a state of emergency,\u201d like the one Belgium had in place for weeks, said Philippe Hayez, a former official with the D.G.S.E., the French external intelligence service.institutions \u2014 indicate that this terrorist attack is not aimed solely against Belgium,\u201d Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, said at a news conference in Berlin."}
