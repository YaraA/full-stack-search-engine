{"title": "German Anti-Immigrant Figure Quits Post After Posing as Hitler", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/22/world/europe/pegida-hitler-photo-germany.html", "body": "Dresden prosecutors said they were investigating whether there were sufficient grounds to bring charges against Mr. Bachmann. German law forbids the display of Nazi symbols and punishes incitement and hate speech.\n\n\u201cHitler photos, racist slogans, now we see what is really behind Pegida\u2019s middle-class facade,\u201d Sigmar Gabriel, Ms. Merkel\u2019s deputy chancellor, told Bild, deriding the group for posing as defenders of the people while harboring Nazi sentiments.\n\n\u201cAnyone involved in politics who dresses up as Hitler is either pretty much an idiot, or a Nazi,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Bachmann\u2019s profile picture on Facebook had been changed to an image of Charlie Chaplin as the Great Dictator, from the 1940 film that parodied Hitler, with the comment, \u201cHe can do satire ... not Lutz!\u201d\n\nMr. Bachmann told Bild that he had posted the Hitler photo to coincide with the release of an audio version of a satirical book by Timur Vermes, a German writer, called \u201cEr Ist Wieder Da,\u201d or \u201cLook Who\u2019s Back,\u201d in which Hitler returns to Berlin in 2011. \u201cOne has to be able to sometimes make fun of oneself,\u201d he told the paper.\n\nThe surprising strength of the Pegida movement has dominated German political debate since late December, when the group attracted more than 10,000 people to its weekly marches through Dresden.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Pegida\u2019s primary goals are limiting the influx of immigrants, protecting the country\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage and rejecting so-called hate preachers of any kind. Followers also rail about foreigners\u2019 living off German taxpayers.\n\nChancellor Merkel and her government have repeatedly warned Germans against following Pegida, questioning the motives underlying its anti-immigrant message.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPegida\u2019s leaders have largely avoided talking to the news media, and advise their followers to do the same, contributing to an air of mystery about the organization\u2019s origins.\n\nMr. Bachmann was one of the more visible members of the leadership. Last fall, as the marches began, the local newspaper S\u00e4chsische Zeitung reported that Mr. Bachmann had a criminal record: convictions for 16 burglaries, driving drunk or without a license and dealing in cocaine. The newspaper also reported that he had worked as a publicist for nightclubs at one point.\n\nInterviewed last month before one of the Monday evening marches in Dresden, Mr. Bachmann was asked about his criminal past and whether it accorded with his concerns that immigrants were bringing crime to Germany. Addressing the marchers, he said, \u201cI, too, have a previous life,\u201d adding, \u201cIf it is better for our cause, I am ready to step out of the unwanted spotlight.\u201d\n\nPegida has sought to play down allegations of links to the far right, insisting that it is a grass-roots movement of concerned citizens.\n\nIt has also sought to play down the reports that Mr. Bachmann has a criminal record, with Katrin Oertel, another leader, saying on national public television that everyone deserves a second chance.\n\nIt was not clear if that belief would withstand the uproar caused by the publication of Mr. Bachmann\u2019s Hitler photo.\n\nThe march in Leipzig on Wednesday night was organized after the German authorities prevented Pegida from holding its regular weekly march in Dresden on Monday because, they said, Mr. Bachmann had been the target of a terrorist threat."}
