Party) and has given the green light for a civilian Constitution and for the establishment of a presidential system.\u201d\n\nIn a victory speech on Sunday in Ankara, the capital, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu made clear that, with its restored majority in Parliament, the A.K.P. would push for a new Constitution.\n\nMr. Erdogan has said he envisions a presidency with powers even greater than that of the president in the American system.\n\nIn the pursuit of greater powers, there is the possibility, analysts say, of reviving the peace process with the country\u2019s Kurdish minority. Once, Mr. Erdogan had pushed forward a peace plan with the Kurds to end a long war, and he offered more concessions, such as language and cultural rights, to the Kurds than any other Turkish leader in history. And before June\u2019s election, many anticipated that Mr. Erdogan was counting on support from the Kurds to change the Constitution in a bargain that would have given him an executive presidency and the Kurds more rights and autonomy.\n\n\u201cThere is a natural trade-off between what the Kurdish party wants and what Erdogan wants,\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, an expert on Turkey with Carnegie Europe, in a conference call with reporters on Monday.\n\nBut a deal will not come easily, as the resumption of the war with the militants of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., in recent months and a crackdown on the civilian side of the Kurdish movement, through harassment and mass arrests, have destroyed trust between the two sides.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile the Kurdish-dominated Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, or H.D.P., surpassed a 10 percent legal threshold to enter Parliament, it lost roughly one million votes, which party leaders attributed to the government\u2019s efforts to tarnish the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party by linking it to terrorism by the militants of the P.K.K.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis was not a fair election, period,\u201d Selahattin Demirtas, the co-leader of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, said on Sunday, noting that the party had barely campaigned because of fears about security. \u201cWe won close to 11 percent of the vote without a campaign, trying to protect our people from massacres.\u201d\n\nQuestions persist about the quality of Turkey\u2019s democratic institutions, such as the news media and the judiciary, which critics and analysts say have increasingly come under the control of Mr. Erdogan and his party.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The magazine\u2019s editor was detained, and distribution of the publication was halted, the local news media reported.\n\nEven in the absence of a new Constitution, Mr. Erdogan will continue to wield enormous influence. In September, he added more loyalists to its governing committee, even though by law he is supposed to remain impartial and above partisan politics.\n\nNaz Masraff, the director for Europe at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said in an interview that Mr. Erdogan would \u201ccontinue to head cabinet meetings as he deems necessary, block various appointments, delay government bills, and will eventually push for a formal switch to a presidential system when he deems the timing is right.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut until then Turkey will be ruled under a de facto executive presidency,\u201d Ms. Masraff said.\n\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s victory not only revitalized his presidential ambitions, but it may also have restored some shine to his position as a regional Islamist leader. After the Arab uprisings began in 2011, Mr. Erdogan visited Cairo and Tunis, offering a vision of Islamic democracy to the revolutionaries. But after the ouster in 2013 of the elected government of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, and Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian tilt at home, his example was seen more as a cautionary tale.\n\nYet in the wake of the election victory, according to Al Jazeera, he received congratulatory messages from the Brotherhood as well as from Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip and has received crucial support from Turkey.\n\nIslamist rebel groups fighting in Syria that Turkey has backed \u2014 under a policy that has been deeply contentious here, especially as violence has spilled into Turkey \u2014 also offered congratulations.\n\nOn Monday, as analysts weighed the meaning of the election results for Turkey\u2019s future, they were introspective, asking why everyone seemed to be so off in their predictions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Erdogan gambled, and it paid off,\u201d said Omer Taspinar, a Turkey expert at the Brookings Institution. \u201cPeople want stability. They have seen 13 years of stability, and compared to the 1990s, the last decade in Turkey is much better.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have underestimated as analysts the power of the A.K.P.\u201d\n\nOn Monday morning, Mr. Erdogan attended prayers at a mosque in Istanbul and then visited the graves of his parents before making his first comments to reporters about the election.\n\nAlluding to the turmoil of recent months, which included the worst terrorist attack in modern Turkey, he said, \u201cThe developments in that short span of time made the people say, \u2018There is no way out other than stability.\u2019 \u201d", "summary": "Writing in the pro-government newspaper Daily Sabah on Monday, Ilnur Cevik, a columnist, wrote, \u201cThe message is loud and clear: The Turkish nation has decided it will continue its march to the future with the Justice and Development Party (A.K.In a victory speech on Sunday in Ankara, the capital, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu made clear that, with its restored majority in Parliament, the A.K.P.\u201cThere is a natural trade-off between what the Kurdish party wants and what Erdogan wants,\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, an expert on Turkey with Carnegie Europe, in a conference call with reporters on Monday.Questions persist about the quality of Turkey\u2019s democratic institutions, such as the news media and the judiciary, which critics and analysts say have increasingly come under the control of Mr. Erdogan and his party.Alluding to the turmoil of recent months, which included the worst terrorist attack in modern Turkey, he said, \u201cThe developments in that short span of time made the people say, \u2018There is no way out other than stability.\u2019 \u201d"}
