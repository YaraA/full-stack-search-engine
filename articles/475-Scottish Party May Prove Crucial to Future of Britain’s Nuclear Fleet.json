{"title": "Scottish Party May Prove Crucial to Future of Britain\u2019s Nuclear Fleet", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/world/europe/scottish-party-may-prove-crucial-to-future-of-britains-nuclear-fleet.html", "body": "Malcolm Chalmers, director of research at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said that the Scottish National Party will try to make the fleet an issue of principle, and use the nuclear debate to advance its effort to make Scotland independent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a scenario in which Britain will give up Trident because of the Scottish National Party, but I do see them making it awkward for the nuclear force with regard to renewing the submarine fleet, and of using the issue as a way of demonstrating their logic \u2014 that you have to have independence if you want to remove nuclear weapons from Scotland,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Chalmers added, \u201cThere are a lot of people among the political classes and senior military figures who would like a third way in which Britain could remain a nuclear power but spend a lot less money on it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe problem, he said, is that \u201cit\u2019s much harder to work out what that would be.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s strategy is to have a nuclear-armed submarine permanently at sea as a deterrent against attack. Experts say that reducing the number of submarines from the current four would undermine that stance because spare submarines are needed for maintenance reasons, or in the event of collisions. A delay in a planned upgrade of the fleet might produce few savings because of the additional costs of patching up submarines that will be 35 years old by the late 2020s.\n\nBut the politics of Scotland is now crucial to the future of Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent. Angus Robertson, the Scottish National Party\u2019s defense spokesman, said that Faslane is a symbol of how Scottish views on Trident have been \u201ctotally ignored\u201d and that \u201crepeated British governments have made decisions over the heads of people in Scotland.\u201d\n\nMr. Robertson said the proximity of Faslane to Glasgow, less than 40 miles away, makes Scotland\u2019s largest population center a target for any enemy attack, fueling hostility to nuclear weapons. \u201cThere is overwhelming public opposition,\u201d he said, citing stances taken by activists, churches and labor unions, among others.\n\nIt was in the 1980s that camps of protesters against nuclear weapons sprang up around Britain, the best known at Greenham Common in Berkshire. After the end of the Cold War they mostly disappeared, but not at Faslane. Even on a cold and bleak recent winter day, a handful of volunteers huddled by wood stoves inside camping vehicles and wooden structures across the highway from the Faslane base, which is encircled by a fence topped with razor wire.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOthers are more concerned about the cost of modernizing the fleet, estimated by the government at 25 billion pounds \u2014 and by Mr. Robertson at perhaps four times that amount \u2014 and whether Britain can afford to remain in the nuclear club.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some members of the defense establishment believe it would be better spent on conventional forces. David Ramsbotham, a former British army general and current member of the House of Lords, said he is \u201cvery worried that we\u2019ve got an unbalanced defense budget\u201d with too much tied up in \u201cexpensive things like aircraft carriers, Typhoon aircraft, submarines and, of course, Trident.\u201d\n\nHe described the logic of Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent as \u201cout of date thinking,\u201d and said \u201cthe decision on Trident must be based on the analysis of our position in the world relative to it.\u201d\n\nWith Britain likely to fall below its NATO military spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product, the debate seems sure to intensify.\n\nPhoto\n\nA decision is due next year on whether to modernize the fleet of Vanguard submarines that carry the Trident system. If the Conservatives win the election in May, Trident\u2019s future seems assured. Speaking in Parliament in January, the defense secretary, Michael Fallon, said that the naval base is \u201ctruly Britain\u2019s peace camp\u201d and that the country \u201cfaces the threat of nuclear blackmail from rogue states.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish National Party has ruled out cooperation with the Conservatives.\n\nAsked about a possible deal with Labour, Mr. Robertson said eliminating the Trident program was one of three issues that \u201cwill be key to the S.N.P. after the election.\u201d (The others are more expansionary economic policies and greater powers for politicians in Scotland.)\n\nA minority Labour government might still be able to push through a modernization of the fleet with the support of the Conservatives. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, has ruled out a full coalition with the Scottish National Party, while keeping open the option of a looser arrangement. But if such a deal came about, the Scottish National Party might refuse to agree to government spending plans that included the renewal of Trident, perhaps forcing an indefinite delay.\n\nNot all Scots want to kill off Trident. In Helensburgh, a few miles from Faslane, Michael Curley, owner of the Buffet Shop, a delicatessen, said the demise of the nuclear fleet would \u201cdevastate\u201d the town. Faslane, he said, is a \u201crecession-free\u201d employer immune from economic downturns.\n\nBut Scottish opponents include Feargal Dalton, a former British naval officer who served at Faslane and who, as a submariner, fired an unarmed Trident missile in an exercise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Dalton now works as a teacher and represents the Scottish National Party on the Glasgow City Council, but still proudly wears a submariner\u2019s badge.\n\nHe believes that the rationale for Trident is rooted less in military logic than in the desire of London politicians for Britain to be seen as \u201ca world player.\u201d\n\n\u201cScots,\u201d he added, \u201cdon\u2019t see things like that.\u201d\n\nThat is certainly true at what organizers claim is the world\u2019s oldest peace camp, a collection of brightly painted caravans, rickety wooden structures and banners opposite the well-guarded naval base. Chris Higgins arrived here last year and, a few weeks later, put on his wet suit, got into a canoe and began paddling quietly toward the sensitive military installation before finally setting off an alarm that brought armed, amphibious police.\n\n\u201cIt is scary enough when the searchlight hits you,\u201d Mr. Higgins said, adding that, despite being arrested and fined, he would do it all again, even at the risk of drowning \u201cor getting shot.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Robertson said the proximity of Faslane to Glasgow, less than 40 miles away, makes Scotland\u2019s largest population center a target for any enemy attack, fueling hostility to nuclear weapons.Even on a cold and bleak recent winter day, a handful of volunteers huddled by wood stoves inside camping vehicles and wooden structures across the highway from the Faslane base, which is encircled by a fence topped with razor wire.Speaking in Parliament in January, the defense secretary, Michael Fallon, said that the naval base is \u201ctruly Britain\u2019s peace camp\u201d and that the country \u201cfaces the threat of nuclear blackmail from rogue states.\u201dThat is certainly true at what organizers claim is the world\u2019s oldest peace camp, a collection of brightly painted caravans, rickety wooden structures and banners opposite the well-guarded naval base.Chris Higgins arrived here last year and, a few weeks later, put on his wet suit, got into a canoe and began paddling quietly toward the sensitive military installation before finally setting off an alarm that brought armed, amphibious police."}
