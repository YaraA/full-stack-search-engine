He also said he wanted the independent Office of Budget Responsibility, which scrutinizes government economic plans, to \u201ctest, test, and test again to demonstrate our plans are workable and affordable.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMr. McDonnell raised the possibility of structural change, calling for a review of the operations of the British Treasury, of the mandate of the Bank of England, and of the resources and operations of Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, the national tax collection agency.\n\nWhile the speech was long on rhetoric, and promised sweeping reviews of economic policy, it was short on detail. There was no mention of moves to consider a tax on financial transactions \u2014 something that Mr. McDonnell had suggested before Monday\u2019s speech \u2014 nor was there detail on his plan to use quantitative easing to stimulate investment in the economy.\n\nAn ideological ally of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s, Mr. McDonnell is regarded as an uncompromising figure on Labour\u2019s left, and giving him the job of shadow chancellor, in charge of economic policy, was Mr. Corbyn\u2019s most controversial appointment.
