They have been charged by French prosecutors in an elaborate campaign-finance scheme that has been crucial to keeping the National Front afloat for years.\n\nThe financial scandals have not dented Ms. Le Pen in the polls before the first round of voting on April 23. Potentially more damaging may be the recent revelations about the people she has surrounded herself with, in particular Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau.\n\n\u201cThey have remained National Socialist,\u201d said Aymeric Chauprade, once Ms. Le Pen\u2019s principal adviser on foreign affairs until a falling out, partly over his pro-Israel stance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are anti-Semites, nostalgic for the Third Reich, violently anticapitalist, with a hatred for democracy,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cPeople think they\u2019re marginal. But in fact, I discovered, she protects them. She supports them. They are at the heart of everything.\u201d\n\nMr. Chauprade recalled a dinner with Mr. Chatillon and others in the spring of 2014 that was \u201cfull of anti-Semitic jokes.\u201d But he added: \u201cThey are not joking. They are real Nazis.\u201d\n\nIn court documents and in interviews, the two men are depicted as unreformed Nazi sympathizers. And a new book, \u201cMarine Knows Everything,\u201d by two investigative journalists, Marine Turchi and Mathias Destal, includes a photo of Mr. Chatillon, fist raised, at a 1994 rally for a far-right student movement called G.U.D., or Groupe Union D\u00e9fense.\n\nPhoto\n\nSeparately, an affidavit filed in a 2014 defamation lawsuit (later dropped) offers a fuller portrait of Mr. Chatillon\u2019s extremist views from that era.\n\nIn the affidavit, Denis Le Moal, once a member of G.U.D., described Mr. Chatillon\u2019s nostalgia for the Third Reich and his closeness to Holocaust deniers.\n\nMr. Le Moal told of a 1993 rally Mr. Chatillon organized for the student group in Paris that resounded with \u201cSieg Heils\u201d and Nazi salutes.\n\n\u201cDuring that period, every year, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon organized a dinner on the birthday of the \u2018fuhrer,\u2019 April 20, to pay homage to \u2018this great man,\u2019\u201d the affidavit states.\n\nIt goes on to describe a gathering in a Paris restaurant when Mr. Chatillon brought a painted portrait of Hitler \u2014 \u201ca portrait Chatillon showed us during the dinner, saying, \u2018My beloved fuhrer, he is magnificent,\u2019 and kissing the picture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt says he also organized \u201cstriped-pajama\u201d parties as a student, an allusion to the clothing Jews wore in death camps and concentration camps.\n\n\u201cThe only debatable point, in the use of the term \u2018neo-Nazi,\u2019 is the wrongful qualifier \u2018neo,\u2019\u201d the affidavit states.\n\nRequests to arrange interviews with Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau through associates of theirs were unsuccessful. The men have made no secret of their disdain for journalists.\n\n\u201cTo hell with Hitler and the Third Reich!\u201d Mr. Chatillon wrote in a recent Facebook posting. \u201cBut to hell also with these \u2018journalists\u2019 who write whatever the hell they want.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Loustau denounced \u201cthese activists hiding behind a press card, benefiting from all the means of state television to try to destroy us.\u201d\n\nThe National Front\u2019s treasurer, Wallerand de Saint-Just, defended the men. \u201cIn no sense are they nostalgic for the Third Reich,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey were turbulent boys, but they have become true professionals,\u201d Mr. Saint-Just said. \u201cThey work closely with us and we have confidence in them, in the conception, printing and delivery of campaign materials.\u201d", "summary": "Other video showed Mr. Chatillon speaking warmly of his own visit with Mr. Degrelle, who was a patron saint of Europe\u2019s far-right youths until his death in 1994.Some in the National Front flatly deny Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau are either anti-Semitic or nostalgic for the Third Reich, while others make no secret of avoiding them, precisely because of their taint.Separately, an affidavit filed in a 2014 defamation lawsuit (later dropped) offers a fuller portrait of Mr. Chatillon\u2019s extremist views from that era.Le Moal told of a 1993 rally Mr. Chatillon organized for the student group in Paris that resounded with \u201cSieg Heils\u201d and Nazi salutes.\u201cDuring that period, every year, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon organized a dinner on the birthday of the \u2018fuhrer,\u2019 April 20, to pay homage to \u2018this great man,\u2019\u201d the affidavit states."}
