Lech was the public face, the charismatic one with a high degree of political finesse, and Jaroslaw was the more backstage figure, persuading people and fashioning a political vision.\n\nThey promised to complete the unfinished work of the Solidarity movement with a platform stressing traditional Catholic values and a zeal for unmasking and prosecuting anyone who had collaborated with the Communist authorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLaw and Justice first won power in 2005, four years after its founding. Lech became president and Jaroslaw, eventually, his prime minister. After two tumultuous years, voters turned them out in favor of Civic Platform, the party\u2019s chief center-right rival, though Lech Kaczynski continued as president.\n\nThen, in 2010, a plane carrying the president and much of Poland\u2019s top leadership crashed while landing at an airport near Smolensk, Russia. Everyone was killed, a cataclysmic event that rocked Polish politics and still simmers within Law and Justice ranks, in which many believe Russia was behind the crash.\n\n\u201cThe death of his twin, which affected Kaczynski profoundly and continues to be a focus of his concerns, forced him into the spotlight,\u201d said John S. Micgiel, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who has studied Poland closely.\n\nNever married, Mr. Kaczynski lived with his mother until her death early last year and now lives alone, with his cat, Fiona. He is said to be an affable and unerringly polite person, but one with a steel spine who brooks no rivals within the party.\n\nWhat remains unanswered is how far Law and Justice will be able to go \u2014 even with a hobbled constitutional tribunal and firmer control of the national prosecutor\u2019s office and government-controlled media \u2014 before running up against the limits of both domestic and European politics.\n\nThe legislation to give the government more direct control of the public broadcaster, which is being rebranded as National Media, reflecting a new emphasis on nationalistic and patriotic programming, drew sharp reactions in Poland and in the European Union.\n\n\u201cWe believe that culture should be free,\u201d said Katarzyna Janowska, who recently resigned as head of the public television channel covering Polish culture. \u201cThey believe that culture should be used to promote something. But you can\u2019t discuss it with them because you live in two different countries, in two different realities.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Law and Justice officials have, in effect, told them to mind their own business.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Friday, the government appointed Jacek Kurski, a deputy culture minister known as the \u201cbull terrier\u201d of the party, as head of all 14 public television channels, including TVP1, the country\u2019s most-watched station. More such moves are promised in coming months.\n\n\u201cPublic television will become a place of honest debate and fair fight,\u201d Mr. Kurski said Friday, vowing to model the network upon BBC. \u201cAs the public television, we will do everything to rebuild national unity and aim for grand, noble goals.\u201d\n\nNeither Mr. Kaczynski nor any other top officials in the governing party replied to requests for interviews. But in public statements, leaders of Law and Justice and party supporters simply point out that they won the presidential race last May and the parliamentary elections in late October, earning an outright majority in Parliament, the first time that has happened since the first post-Communist election in 1989.\n\n\u201cTheir feeling is, \u2018We won the election, so now we should be able to put our people into positions of power and authority,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Micgiel said.\n\nIn an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Witold Waszczykowski, Poland\u2019s new foreign minister, said: \u201cThe previous government carried out a leftist program. It was as if the world was according to a Marxist model which has to automatically develop in only one direction \u2014 a new mixture of cultures and races, a world made up of cyclists and vegetarians, who only use renewable energy and fight all forms of religion.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Waszczykowski summoned the German ambassador to discuss recent critical remarks by German officials about the new government\u2019s moves.\n\n\u201cI want to strongly state that no pressure, no threats, no words which should never be spoken, particularly by Germans, will make us turn back from this path,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski said. \u201cWe will not turn back!\u201d\n\nCritics in the opposition, the European Union and the Western media are objecting, officials of the new government say, not because they truly believe Law and Justice is acting in an undemocratic fashion, but because they see their hold on power slipping and their vision of a diverse, liberal Poland evaporating.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLiberal politicians in Western Europe, like Mr. Verhofstadt, did not complain when the previous government humiliated and persecuted Law and Justice, said Anna Fotyga, a former foreign minister who represents Law and Justice in the European Parliament.\n\n\u201cBut somehow, any attempts to modify the functioning of state institutions by the current government is a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nIn any case, the criticism has shown no signs of deterring Mr. Kaczynski. When Mr. Orban visited southern Poland this month for consultations, neither Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, nor its prime minister, Beata Szydlo, were anywhere to be seen. Instead, Mr. Orban disappeared into the historic Niedzica Castle with Mr. Kaczynski.", "summary": "\u201cThe death of his twin, which affected Kaczynski profoundly and continues to be a focus of his concerns, forced him into the spotlight,\u201d said John S.
