{"title": "Asylum Seekers Stir Commerce and Compassion in Greek Village", "authors": ["Suzanne Daley"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/world/europe/asylum-seekers-refugees-evzonoi-greece.html", "body": "Some residents saw the arrival of the refugees as a welcome shot of commerce. Tasos Christakis, the owner of the Vergina, bought and reopened the other hotel near the main square (four rooms). Simos Adamidis, the owner of the Hara Hotel, packed his lobby with the kinds of things that someone on a long march might need, selling ponchos, flashlights, foot bandages and much-sought-after Snickers candy bars.\n\nBut others saw only a humanitarian crisis and the pain and displacement of war. They collected food and clothes, sat under signs on market days asking for donations and risked felony charges and the confiscation of their cars by sometimes ignoring the human trafficking statutes that make it illegal for them to give rides to the refugees, even when they are elderly, disabled or carrying babies.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor a while, the roads were clogged with weary travelers trudging north. Most arrived by train at Thessaloniki and walked the 50 miles to the border here. Then, last month, the government and international relief agencies stepped in, allowing buses to bypass the villages and whisk most refugees and migrants straight to the border, as long as the asylum seekers could pay the fare.\n\nYet there seems little chance that life will go back to normal around here soon.\n\nIn these small villages where everyone knows everyone, the business of judging one another\u2019s behavior is in full swing.\n\n\u201cI would really love to know who turned me in,\u201d said Evelina Politidou, a member of the regional town council, who spent four nights in jail and faces felony smuggling charges for giving a ride to a refugee family. Her car has been in the pound since Aug. 9.\n\nShe makes do these days with her uncle\u2019s pickup truck, but she said she was still determined to help. She was busy recently handing out water to new arrivals at the transit camp at the border with Macedonia, an area where rolls of barbed wire separate each country\u2019s corn and potato fields.\n\nLike others who threw themselves into helping the refugees, she says too many businesses in the region simply took advantage of the misery that passed before them, raising their prices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome, she said, made people pay as much as 5 euros, about $6, to charge their phones. Others doubled the cost of water and charged by the hour for hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cOne of these hotel guys would call the police when the volunteers showed up at his place because we were giving things away for free,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, we should give him an award for social service.\u201d\n\nChristos P. Gkountenoudis, the mayor of Paionia, which includes Evzonoi, said the past year had been difficult, with most of the focus on the islands where the migrants first arrived. His area, with an unemployment rate of 45 percent (almost twice the national average), was left to struggle with the stream of refugees and migrants on its own, he said. With so many needy Greeks in these parts, he said he could hardly justify spending on the refugees.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, he said, there had not been any trouble. \u201cThe one thing I can tell you is that, with all the people that have passed through here, we have had no robberies, no incidents of criminality whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only issue has been the garbage. They leave a lot of garbage behind. But even that, we have had volunteers to help with.\u201d\n\nFor now, he has agreed to the transit camp at the border, where as many as 5,000 have arrived on a single day, waiting for trains to take them across Macedonia to Serbia and on to other parts of the European Union. That is only as long as Macedonia keeps its borders open, Mr. Gkountenoudis said. If Macedonia closes its borders, he said, he will immediately demolish the camp, a cluster of white tents and portable toilets. \u201cWe will not have people living there,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\nThe loss of the refugees\u2019 business has left Mr. Christakis at the Vergina Hotel fuming over his neighbors for their unwarranted fear of the migrants and over those who might have called the tax authorities to inspect his books.\n\n\u201cWhat these narrow-minded people failed to see,\u201d Mr. Christakis said, \u201cis that these refugees spend money. The minimarket was working. The pharmacy was working. And now the refugees will spend their money elsewhere.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Christakis, whose family has owned the Vergina for three generations, said that he had been employing six people this year, but that he might have to lay off three.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, he said, even if the refugees and migrants do not come back, the Arabic signs will stay. He will not give anyone satisfaction by taking them down.\n\n\u201cOf course, I am bitter with the ones who went to the authorities urging them to get the refugees out of here,\u201d Mr. Christakis said. \u201cSome people even said, \u2018I hear they are speaking Arabic now in Evzonoi.\u2019 That really made me angry.\u201d\n\nSome in the village, like Katerina Toulkeridi and her mother, Panagiota, who run a snack bar, say they are glad that the refugees no longer have to walk and are taken straight to the border. For a while, mother and daughter had more customers than they could handle.\n\nAn Arabic menu still hangs by the kitchen wall, translated for them by a Syrian customer. But despite what their neighbors may think, they said, they never really made money on them.\n\n\u201cOther people thought we did because it was so crowded here,\u201d Katerina Toulkeridi said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t. Are you going to leave someone hungry? We did what we did in a quiet manner. These were people with great dignity.\u201d", "summary": "Simos Adamidis, the owner of the Hara Hotel, packed his lobby with the kinds of things that someone on a long march might need, selling ponchos, flashlights, foot bandages and much-sought-after Snickers candy bars.
