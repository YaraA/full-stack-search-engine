And then from there, he starts a whole trajectory,\u201d said Mr. Vidino, who said that the Tunisian migrant was arrested soon after his arrival by boat on the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2011, after back-to-back arson episodes. \u201cHe establishes a track record of bad behavior, which at the beginning was just aggressive and threatening and disrespectful. But in the last place, where he was held in a high-security prison in Palermo, he showed signs of radicalism.\u201d\n\nThe threat to his cellmate was considered serious enough that officials added him to Italy\u2019s database of radicalized individuals, a list that includes only a few hundred names, said Mr. Vidino, who is also the director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.\n\nBoth Italy and Germany tried to deport him to Tunisia but were thwarted by a lack of documents and cooperation from his home country.\n\nEven after Mr. Amri was named as the prime suspect in the attack in Berlin, he was able to roam freely around Europe, his face plastered across the news media and a reward of more than $100,000 on his head.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis mobility is great for the law-abiding and equally great for the non-law-abiding,\u201d said Douglas H. Wise, a former senior C.I.A. officer, of the borderless travel within the European Union.\n\nWhat Mr. Amri did in the four days between the attack in Berlin and when he was ultimately killed in Sesto San Giovanni, a suburb north of central Milan, is not clear, but that is now the subject of an intense investigation that the authorities remain reluctant to discuss.\n\nAsked on Friday when exactly the authorities began to view Mr. Amri as a suspect, the head of Germany\u2019s federal criminal police, Holger M\u00fcnch, restated in general terms that it was on Tuesday, after investigators found an identity document in a wallet in the cab of the tractor-trailer used in the attack.\n\nThe police have not said why the wallet was not discovered on Monday, when the attack occurred and a murdered driver was found in the cab. On Friday, Mr. M\u00fcnch for the first time mentioned that an alias was involved, but he said the police had quickly linked it to Mr. Amri.\n\nIn Italy, Mr. Vidino said that a train ticket found on Mr. Amri\u2019s body showed that he had traveled by train to Turin in Italy from the French town of Chamb\u00e9ry, near the border between the two nations. But there is no trail suggesting how he got from Berlin to Chamb\u00e9ry.\n\nA senior European counterterrorism official said that the delay in identifying Mr. Amri probably gave him a crucial head start of several hours to flee Germany, and that he would have been able to buy a train ticket to France and Italy without showing identification papers.\n\nPhoto\n\nFacial-recognition software on surveillance cameras in Europe is still in rudimentary form in most places, the official said, so even after Mr. Amri was identified, he could have slipped through the train stations undetected, especially if he was wearing a hat or hood.\n\nMr. Amri\u2019s ability to hide through the week and make his way from Germany, through France, to Italy also raised questions of whether he had the help of a broader network, particularly one possibly linked to the Islamic State.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe group called Mr. Amri \u201ca soldier\u201d in the video released on Friday, in which Mr. Amri proclaimed loyalty to its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and declared that the attack in Berlin was intended to avenge coalition airstrikes in Syria that have killed civilians.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The autumn foliage seen on trees suggested it was filmed in fall or even early December.\n\nIn Germany, Mr. Amri came on the radar of the authorities in part for suspected ties to a 32-year-old Iraqi-born Salafist preacher who went by the name Abu Walaa and who was jailed just weeks ago on suspicion of recruiting fighters to join the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThere is high suspicion that he was behind the departure of a number of Germans to Syria \u2014 as many as two dozen \u2014 but the intelligence is not clear as to his exact role, whether in radicalization, recruitment or terror financing,\u201d said Laith Alkhouri, a director at Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company in New York that tracks militant and cyber threats.\n\nIn a telephone call from the suspect\u2019s hometown in Tunisia, Mr. Amri\u2019s older brother, Walid, said that the family wondered whether he became radicalized while in jail in Italy. After his brother was released, he informed the family that he was leaving for Germany \u201cwith friends he had made in jail,\u201d Walid Amri said.\n\nAlso unknown is whether Mr. Amri had any accomplices in the Berlin attack \u2014 a question that Peter Frank, Germany\u2019s top federal prosecutor, identified as a priority for investigators.\n\n\u201cIt is very important now to determine if there was a network of cooperators, a network of supporters, accessories or assistants helping him to prepare the attack, execute the attack and also to escape,\u201d he said at a news conference on Friday in Karlsruhe, Germany.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe only uncertainty that seemed to be settled on Friday was that the man killed was indeed Mr. Amri.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no doubt that the person who was killed was Anis Amri, the suspect in the terrorist attack in Berlin,\u201d the Italian interior minister, Marco Minniti, said at a news conference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs soon as this person entered our country, he was the most wanted man in Europe, and we immediately identified him and neutralized him,\u201d Mr. Minniti said. \u201cThis means that our security is working really well.\u201d\n\nSome analysts, however, said that Mr. Amri\u2019s flight over the past 72 hours from German to Italy through France underscored Europe\u2019s porous border controls. \u201cTerrorists with multiple false identification documents are able to exploit Europe\u2019s open borders. Just as Amri arrived in Europe and moved almost seamlessly around the continent before the Berlin attack, he was able to do the same after it,\u201d said Seth G. Jones, a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corporation.\n\nMr. Amri traveled from Turin to Central Station in Milan, where he arrived around 1 a.m. Friday. Surveillance cameras in the Milan train station recorded Mr. Amri\u2019s movements, Italian investigators said. It was not clear how Mr. Amri made his way to Sesto San Giovanni, about four miles away.\n\n\u201cHow he traveled there and what he was doing there are subject to delicate investigations,\u201d Mr. De Iesu, of the Milan police, said at the news conference. \u201cWe have to understand whether he was in transit or was awaiting someone.\u201d\n\nSesto San Giovanni is a \u201ca strategic hub for transportation,\u201d the town\u2019s deputy mayor, Andrea Rivolta, said in an interview at city hall. \u201cSesto is a junction for the railway system, the Milan metro, municipal buses and buses that reach all of Europe,\u201d as well as southern Italy.\n\nAccording to the account provided by Mr. De Iesu, Mr. Amri was standing alone on a piazza in Sesto San Giovanni, next to the northern terminus of a subway line.\n\nWhen the officers stopped him and asked for identification, he responded, in good Italian with a North African accent, that he was not carrying any documents on him. They asked him to empty his pockets and backpack. He was carrying a small knife and the equivalent of a few hundred dollars, but no cellphone.\n\nBut then he pulled out a pistol, Mr. De Iesu said.\n\n\u201cIt was a regular patrol, under the new system of intensified police checks on the territory,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had no perception that it could be him, otherwise they\u2019d have been more careful.\u201d\n\nThe officer whom Mr. Amri shot, identified as Cristian Movio, was wounded in the shoulder and had surgery on Friday. The other officer, who shot Mr. Amri, was identified as Luca Scat\u00e0."}
