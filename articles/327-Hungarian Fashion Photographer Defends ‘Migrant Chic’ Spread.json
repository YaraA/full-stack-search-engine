I do not understand how people can take a clear stand (pro or con) while we are flooded with contradictory information through the media, so no one has extensive knowledge of the situation as a whole. This is exactly what we wanted to picture: you see a suffering woman, who is also beautiful and despite her situation, has some high quality pieces of outfit and a smartphone.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe photographs were \u201cnot intended to glamourize this clearly bad situation,\u201d he said, but \u201cto draw the attention to the problem and make people think about it.\u201d The images, Mr. Baksa added, were based on news photographs of actual events taken in recent weeks at the Hungarian border, many of which provoked outrage at the authorities\u2019 treatment of migrants. Mr. Baksa did suggest, however, that he accepted the Hungarian government\u2019s characterization of some of those caught up in clashes as \u201caggressive migrants or terrorists.\u201d\n\nDespite his best efforts to explain, the vast majority of the responses to Mr. Baksa on social networks came from viewers who urged him, essentially, to quit while he was behind and stop trying to make \u201cmigrant chic\u201d happen.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmong those unconvinced by the photographer\u2019s rationale was his compatriot Szabolcs Panyi of Hungary\u2019s Index.hu.\n\nMeanwhile, images of actual migrants, who are still risking their lives crossing the Mediterranean in the thousands, continue to portray a considerably less sexy reality.", "summary": "As dramatic images of migrants being repelled at the border with Hungary flooded the news media last month, a fashion photographer in Budapest, Norbert Baksa, had an idea: Why not use the backdrop of the crisis \u2014 the barbed-wire enclosures, the clashes with the police \u2014 to display luxury clothing brands?
