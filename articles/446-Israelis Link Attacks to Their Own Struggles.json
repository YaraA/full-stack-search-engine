It\u2019s as if we deserve it, as if we\u2019ve brought this on ourselves.\u201d\n\nIndeed, many Palestinians and their supporters argue that aggression against Israel is part of a continuing war and thus distinct from terrorism targeting civilians elsewhere. Even those who renounce violence generally see Israeli policies, rather than the \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d Mr. Netanyahu talks about, as the context for last summer\u2019s rocket fire from Gaza or last fall\u2019s spate of vehicular, knife and shooting attacks.\n\nAnshel Pfeffer, a columnist for the left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz, said the terrorism in France might well ease international pressure on Israel, if only because European leaders will be distracted by their own urgent challenges. But if the attacks, especially Friday\u2019s targeting of the kosher supermarket, underline \u201cIsrael\u2019s justification for its existence,\u201d Mr. Pfeffer said in an interview, Israeli hopes that this will \u201cquote, bring Europe to its senses, unquote, and realize that Israel is just an outpost in this wider struggle\u201d are unrealistic.\n\n\u201cWhat a lot of Israelis don\u2019t realize is the way Western Europeans see the Palestinian-Israel conflict,\u201d said Mr. Pfeffer, who splits his time between Jerusalem and London and writes frequently about Europe. \u201cThey don\u2019t see it as some kind of struggle between Islam and the West; they see it as a kind of unjust occupation of Palestinian territory.\u201d\n\nPalestinian leaders, too, responded quickly to Wednesday\u2019s murders in Paris. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority sent his own telegram to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France denouncing \u201cthese heinous crimes, condemned by morality and religion.\u201d Mustafa Barghouti, secretary general of the Palestinian National Initiative, declared that the attack \u201cdoes not represent Islam or Muslim culture\u201d and sided squarely with the victims.\n\n\u201cThe Palestinian people struggle and raise their voices every day for their freedom and for ridding the world of oppression and occupation,\u201d Mr. Barghouti said in a statement.\n\nMore on the Paris Shootings\n\nThere was no immediate response from Palestinian leaders to Friday\u2019s deadly hostage-taking at the supermarket. Israeli officials held a series of urgent consultations, local news media reported, and Mr. Netanyahu offered assistance to the French authorities and ordered a review of security protocols for Israeli outposts and Jewish institutions around the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is another attempt by the dark forces of radical Islam to unleash horror and terror on the West,\u201d said Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister, echoing Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s earlier argument. \u201cThe entire international community must stand strong and determined in the face of this terror.\u201d\n\nEitan Haber, who was close to Yitzhak Rabin, the peace-seeking former Israeli prime minister, said Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s repeated statements about Paris were largely for domestic consumption before Israel\u2019s March elections, and \u201cthe terrorists in Europe are doing a very good job for Netanyahu.\u201d\n\nHis opponents took up a similar mantra.\n\n\u201cThe system of values that was handed down to the modern world after the French Revolution, of liberty, equality and fraternity, finds itself challenged,\u201d Isaac Herzog, the head of the Labor Party and Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s main challenger, said in an interview on Israel\u2019s Channel 2 on Friday evening.\n\n\u201cThis is a struggle against terrorism. We need to be very precise,\u201d he added. \u201cAll the nations that seek peace and liberties, the democratic nations, are facing an enormous challenge from fundamentalist, extremist, Muslim terrorism \u2014 which is ISIS and all its precursors, Al Qaeda and so forth. Terrorism is terrorism. There\u2019s no two ways about it.\u201d", "summary": "Even those who renounce violence generally see Israeli policies, rather than the \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d Mr. Netanyahu talks about, as the context for last summer\u2019s rocket fire from Gaza or last fall\u2019s spate of vehicular, knife and shooting attacks.Anshel Pfeffer, a columnist for the left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz, said the terrorism in France might well ease international pressure on Israel, if only because European leaders will be distracted by their own urgent challenges.\u201cWhat a lot of Israelis don\u2019t realize is the way Western Europeans see the Palestinian-Israel conflict,\u201d said Mr. Pfeffer, who splits his time between Jerusalem and London and writes frequently about Europe.\u201cThe Palestinian people struggle and raise their voices every day for their freedom and for ridding the world of oppression and occupation,\u201d Mr. Barghouti said in a statement.\u201cThis is another attempt by the dark forces of radical Islam to unleash horror and terror on the West,\u201d said Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister, echoing Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s earlier argument."}
