Indignant denial gives way to shamed confession. Flanked by steely-eyed spouse and bewildered family, the errant politician mumbles an apology and quits. Hubris, error and the fall from grace follow one another with the inevitability of Aristotelian tragedy.\n\nWith some small variants, that is how it is done here.\n\nImagine, then, the sense of affront this week when, just across the Channel, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France simply refused to follow the British (and American) playbook, stonewalling at a lengthy news conference about a clandestine liaison whose disclosure sent his full-time partner to the hospital to recover from the shock.\n\nFor British journalists among the hundreds of reporters packed into the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris for the presidential New Year\u2019s news conference, the outrage was almost palpable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMorality does matter,\u201d the columnist Alison Phillips fumed in The Daily Mirror tabloid, criticizing the president\u2019s equally indignant refusal to discuss what he termed private matters. \u201cNot necessarily the morals of afternoon delight with a mistress \u2014 but the morality of whether you can tell the truth."}
