Francisco Franco, whose death in 1975 opened the way for Spain\u2019s democracy.\n\nSo it is perhaps no surprise that support for independence from Spain runs strong in Llivia, even if it is unclear what independence would actually mean.\n\nOn referendum day, Llivia voted overwhelmingly in favor of separating from Spain, according to officials \u2014 \u201c561 votes out of 591 in favor of the s\u00ed,\u201d Mayor Nova said proudly.\n\nPhoto\n\nSupporters of the separatist movement in Livia even broke a Guinness World Record by lighting about 82,000 candles in the form of the Estelada, the pro-independence flag, just before the referendum was held.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful, very unique moment,\u201d Ms. Cortizo said. \u201cThe whole village was there to sing \u2018Els Segadors,\u2019 the official national anthem of Catalonia.\u201d\n\nIn the tumultuous aftermath of the vote, Ms. Cortizo was among the around 200,000 people who demonstrated in Barcelona in support of the two secessionist leaders jailed following an order by a Spanish court.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After weeks of equivocating, Mr. Puigdemont told the Spanish authorities that Catalan lawmakers might vote for independence. That was not good enough for Mr. Rajoy, who announced on Saturday that he would remove Catalonia\u2019s leadership.\n\nLlivia is also a neighbor to Catalan-speaking areas in France and Andorra. Brice Lafontaine, a spokesman for Unitat Catalana, a party representing the Catalan minority in France, said the party had met with Mr. Puigdemont in August. \u201cI told the president that should it come it, we stand ready to provide the Catalan leaders with all kinds of logistical support, including hospitality,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe party campaigns for greater autonomy from Paris, though as Mr. Lafontaine pointed out, \u201cFrench Catalans are not seeking independence, just the recognition of our culture.\u201d\n\nInside a small pastry shop on Avenida Catalunya, the main artery running through Llivia, some wondered why Mr. Puigdemont did not declare independence, especially after claiming that the referendum had overwhelmingly passed.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything really,\u201d said Olivia Morlot, a French national who has lived in Llivia since 2001. \u201cHe just threw the ball into Spain\u2019s court.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Ester Gonzales, who was born and raised in Llivia, saw the Catalan leader\u2019s approach as \u201ca necessary step toward independence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to be patient,\u201d she said. \u201cWe understand that independence won\u2019t just happen overnight.\u201d\n\nIn Hostal Rus\u00f3, a small hotel in the historic center, locals gathered to watch Mr. Puigdemont speak before the regional Parliament on Oct. 10.\n\n\u201cOf course we would have preferred if independence had officially been declared,\u201d Xavier Martinez, 51, said afterward. \u201cBut still, President Puigdemont spoke wisely.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf independence had indeed been declared,\u201d Mr. Martinez added, \u201cwe would find ourselves facing a political dead end.\u201d\n\nThat may yet be the case.\n\n\u201cNow the Spanish are going to undermine our claim for independence,\u201d Ms. Cortizo sighed while watching the events unfold on television.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTaking the remote control from her husband, she flipped to the next channel, a French one."}
