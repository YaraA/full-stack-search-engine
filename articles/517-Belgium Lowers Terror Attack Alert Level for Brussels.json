The powder turned out to be harmless.\n\nThe Belgian authorities continue to search for Salah Abdeslam, who is believed to have fled after participating in the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks, and for Mohamed Abrini, who they say was seen with Mr. Abdeslam at a gas station northeast of Paris two days before the attacks.\n\nOn Thursday, as part of their investigation into the Paris attacks, Belgian authorities searched two houses in the eastern city of Verviers, while a judicial tribunal extended for one month the detention of two men who were arrested on Saturday.\n\nAnxiety about terrorist attacks has spread to the Netherlands.\n\nThe Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, told reporters in The Hague on Wednesday that the European Union should do more to stop terrorists posing as refugees and \u201cget the border under control between Turkey and Greece.\u201d\n\nTwo of the Paris attackers are believed to have entered Greece on Oct. 3 by posing as Syrian migrants. Their actual identities have not been disclosed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMainstream European leaders like Mr. Rutte face pressure from populist politicians who have seized on the attacks in Paris as a further sign that the European Union \u2014 hobbling from a long financial crisis that nearly sank the euro and its limited ability to counter a resurgent Russia \u2014 is crumbling amid its accumulating challenges.\n\nMr. Rutte dismissed the stance of Geert Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker who is leader of the anti-Islam, far-right Party for Freedom, who in a recent Op-Ed essay for The New York Times criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for a policy of welcoming migrants.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He also pointed to the popularity of a Dutch politician, of Moroccan descent, Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb of Rotterdam, as a sign of diminishing discrimination.\n\n\u201cI always tell Dutch people I cannot guarantee that nothing will happen,\u201d said Mr. Rutte. \u201cI can only guarantee that I will do everything to prevent it,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Even before the threat level was lowered, some elements of normalcy had returned \u2014 schools and transit were reopened on Wednesday, for example \u2014 though the city remained jittery, its streets patrolled by heavily armed soldiers and armored military vehicles.
