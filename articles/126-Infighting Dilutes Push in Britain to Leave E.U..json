Naturally, they are not impressed with Mr. Cameron\u2019s renegotiation: Liam Fox, a former defense secretary, has accused him of handing out the \u201cpolitical begging bowl.\u201d Philip Davies, another Conservative lawmaker who favors leaving the bloc, calls the effort an \u201cabsolute shambles.\u201d\n\nMr. Farage\u2019s U.K. Independence Party has come to prominence in the last decade, successfully capitalizing on concerns over immigration in European elections but not in those for the British Parliament.\n\nBut the Conservatives have been split on Europe since before 1990 when Margaret Thatcher was pushed out as prime minister. She supported membership of the European Economic Community, as it then was, in Britain\u2019s previous referendum in 1975, but became steadily more hostile to European integration.\n\nHer ouster in a 1990 putsch was partly caused by European policy, and her successor, John Major, was tormented by her supporters.\n\nEven now, several years after her death, there is debate about how Mrs. Thatcher would have voted on exiting the bloc, a \u201cspectacularly silly\u201d discussion, according to Mr. Rees-Mogg, who ridiculed it by suggesting \u201ca quick s\u00e9ance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cKnock once for \u2018yes,\u2019 knock twice for \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d he said, before rapping twice on the table and announcing, with a grin, that Mrs. Thatcher had spoken from beyond the grave. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018no!\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Rees-Mogg makes an economic case for Britain to go it alone, saying that Europe is narrowing Britain\u2019s trading focus, \u201cwhen we need to broaden it.\u201d But he also highlights historical factors that, he says, set Britain apart, including that \u201cit\u2019s also a long time since we have, off our own bat, wanted to fight anyone in Europe.\u201d\n\nAs for his personal style Mr. Rees-Mogg, who does not own a pair of jeans, believes that arguments, not \u201cpersonal quirks\u201d will decide the referendum. Anyway, he says, \u201cI can\u2019t suddenly pretend to be Mr. Trendy.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

The best known and most knowledgeable of these is Bill Cash, a veteran lawmaker once derided by Mr. Major as \u201cobsessive, driven and, on Europe, frankly a bore.\u201d\n\nMr. Cash has long worried about the erosion of national sovereignty. Younger euroskeptics also contend that European institutions lack democratic legitimacy, and that Britain\u2019s history and common law legal system sets it apart.\n\n\u201cWe have different histories,\u201d said Mr. Davies, the Conservative lawmaker. \u201cThe motivation for the European Union was, in a sense, to stop France and Germany from going to war with each other.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf France and Germany want to do that, good luck to them. But that wasn\u2019t our history.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Rees-Mogg, was educated at Eton College and Oxford University and is the son of the onetime editor of The London Times, William Rees-Mogg, Mr. Davies grew up in Doncaster, northern England, and was a supermarket manager before being elected to Parliament.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Davies\u2019s main argument reflects a switch of emphasis made by euroskeptics in the last decade, when they began to argue that membership in the bloc was shackling Britain to an economic corpse.\n\n\u201cEurope is an economic disaster zone, and unless we can start looking outwards, we are going to get nowhere,\u201d Mr. Davies said. That argument has resonance because it relates to the central reason that Britain joined the bloc in the first place.\n\nBack then Britain\u2019s economy was stagnant and arguably needed the impetus of membership in a club that had helped France and Germany to thrive.\n\nNow the roles are reversed, with Britain\u2019s economy outperforming most of the Continent.\n\nEuroskeptics are trying to reverse the common assumption that an exit is a leap into the unknown. Mr. Davies says the bloc is fated ultimately to \u201cfall apart,\u201d and Mr. Rees-Mogg suggests that it would be safer to stay \u201cgoverned by our own democratic forms, rather than to be in a country called Europe, governed by a bureaucracy in Brussels.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Farage and others have campaigned against immigration into Britain from Eastern Europe, which surged after the expansion of the European Union.\n\nThat happened after Britain decided to open its labor market immediately to new European Union citizens in 2004, unlike countries such as Germany and France, which exercised a right to delay their employment rights.\n\nWhile Britain is outside the union\u2019s passport-free travel zone, known as Schengen, euroskeptics argue that since Europeans have a right to live and work in one another\u2019s countries, only by quitting the bloc can Britain control its borders.\n\nIndeed, the big dilemma for those who want to quit the union is how hard to push this argument. The two main groups campaigning for a \u201cno\u201d vote are rivals: Vote Leave, supported by most Conservatives, which emphasizes economic and sovereignty issues; and Leave.eu, which has the support of Mr. Farage and focuses on immigration and identity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther politicians know that while Mr. Farage might galvanize some voters, he is a divisive figure. That has led to feuding over which organization should be the approved \u201cno\u201d campaign.\n\nWhether these divisions matter to voters is unclear, and having several different messages might actually help the departure movement by allowing its campaign to reach different groups.\n\nOne seasoned European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity following protocol, believes that in the end the divisions in the exit camp may not matter. Those who want Britain to remain in the bloc have a big battle on their hands, he said, because euroskeptics have tapped into a rich vein of British life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that Britons see themselves as different from the Continent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they really want to be.\u201d", "summary": "Because cabinet ministers who oppose Mr. Cameron on the issue are not yet free to argue to leave the union (they will be once the renegotiation is complete), so far the less senior euroskeptic lawmakers have been making the case.
