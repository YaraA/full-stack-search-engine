He returned to Brussels and drove again to Paris on Nov. 12 with Salah Abdeslam and his brother Ibrahim.\n\nMr. Van der Sijpt said that Mr. Abrini\u2019s fingerprints and DNA were found in the car used during those trips and in an apartment on Rue Henri Berg\u00e9 in the Schaerbeek section of Brussels, where investigators say they believe explosive vests used in the Paris attacks were made.\n\nMr. Van der Sijpt also said that Mr. Abrini\u2019s fingerprints and DNA were found in a Schaerbeek apartment on Rue Max Roos. The three Brussels airport attackers left from that apartment by taxi on the morning of the attacks, and investigators later found large quantities of explosives and bomb-making equipment.\n\nAlthough this suggests that Mr. Abrini was involved in the Brussels plot, Mr. Van der Sijpt did not confirm that Mr. Abrini was the third and as yet unidentified bomber, as some Belgian news media reported. The two others, who died when they detonated their explosives at 7:58 a.m. in the departures hall at the airport, have been identified as Ibrahim el-Bakraoui and Najim Laachraoui, the suspected bombmaker.\n\nA little over an hour after the airport bombings, a third suicide bomber, Khalid el-Bakraoui, Ibrahim\u2019s brother, detonated explosives at the Maelbeek subway station in central Brussels. Over all, the attacks in Brussels killed 32 people and wounded more than 340.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the investigators are verifying whether Abrini can be positively identified as being the third person present during the attacks in Brussels National Airport, the so-called man with the hat,\u201d Mr. Van der Sijpt said, referring to the suspect\u2019s attire on the day of the bombings. The suspect was wearing a dark hat and white jacket, which he later discarded.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

The second, identified as Osama K., was using the alias Naim al-Ahmed.\n\n\u201cThe investigation into the Paris attacks has shown that Osama K. was picked up in Ulm, Germany, and brought to Belgium on Oct. 3rd, 2015, with a rental car hired by Salah Abdeslam,\u201d Mr. Van der Sijpt said.\n\nBut Mr. Van der Sijpt added that it was unclear whether Osama K. was also the person who was seen with the subway bomber before the attacks. That person was also filmed at a mall in Brussels buying bags that were used in the airport attacks, Mr. Van der Sijpt said.\n\nFew details were provided about the other three taken into custody: One was identified only as Herv\u00e9 B.M., and the others were not named.\n\nOn Thursday the Belgian police had released new surveillance footage of the third airport suspect and had renewed an appeal to the public for help identifying him.\n\nThe Belgian federal prosecutor, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Van Leeuw, had said that the third assailant at the airport had dropped off a large bag filled with explosives before leaving, but that the explosives detonated after a bomb disposal squad arrived after the attacks, hurting no one.", "summary": "Mr. Van der Sijpt said that Mr. Abrini\u2019s fingerprints and DNA were found in the car used during those trips and in an apartment on Rue Henri Berg\u00e9 in the Schaerbeek section of Brussels, where investigators say they believe explosive vests used in the Paris attacks were made.The two others, who died when they detonated their explosives at 7:58 a.m. in the departures hall at the airport, have been identified as Ibrahim el-Bakraoui and Najim Laachraoui, the suspected bombmaker.A little over an hour after the airport bombings, a third suicide bomber, Khalid el-Bakraoui, Ibrahim\u2019s brother, detonated explosives at the Maelbeek subway station in central Brussels.\u201cAt the moment, the investigators are verifying whether Abrini can be positively identified as being the third person present during the attacks in Brussels National Airport, the so-called man with the hat,\u201d Mr. Van der Sijpt said, referring to the suspect\u2019s attire on the day of the bombings.\u201cThe investigation into the Paris attacks has shown that Osama K. was picked up in Ulm, Germany, and brought to Belgium on Oct. 3rd, 2015, with a rental car hired by Salah Abdeslam,\u201d Mr. Van der Sijpt said."}
