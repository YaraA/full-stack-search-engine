I don\u2019t need a ventriloquist.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Mr. Hamon, for instance, pointedly described himself as someone who would be \u201can honest and fair president,\u201d free from the influence of \u201cmoney and lobbies.\u201d\n\nMr. Hamon, the Socialist candidate, has promised a guaranteed \u201cuniversal income\u201d and has spoken of cutting the already reduced French workweek, but his chances are thought to be lowered by the presence of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, whose positions are largely similar.\n\nMs. Le Pen, who also faces accusations related to fictional jobs, accused Mr. M\u00e9lenchon of being a \u201cRobespierre\u201d when he called on voters to \u201creward the virtuous and punish those who don\u2019t seem so.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron, for his part, projected an image of innocence and virtue, and Ms. Le Pen aimed directly for it, with the most savage blast of the evening aimed at his reputation for speaking at length but saying little.\n\nAfter a windy declaration by Mr. Macron on protecting France\u2019s \u201cindependence,\u201d Ms. Le Pen, whose campaign is centered on a withdrawal from the European Union, mockingly repeated the word before firing back.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken for seven minutes, and I have no idea what you said,\u201d she said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said anything. Every time you talk, you take a little of this, and a little of that, and you never settle on anything.\u201d", "summary": "Le Pen, inheritor of the anti-immigrant, populist National Front party from her father, concentrated her fire Monday night on her younger opponent.\u201cThe trap you are falling into, Madame Le Pen, with your provocations, is to divide society,\u201d he said, adding that she was making \u201cenemies out of more than four million French men and women whose religion happens to be Islam.\u201dMr. Fillon was once favored to win the election, but he has been wounded by a series of scandals, most notably charges of embezzlement over allegations that he put family members on the government payroll for nonexistent jobs.He sought during the debate to project a reassuring image of gravity, but he was forced to acknowledge that he \u201cmight have made some mistakes.\u201d Most recently, he was accused of accepting two suits worth 13,000 euros, or about $14,000, from a political fixer.Mr. Hamon, the Socialist candidate, has promised a guaranteed \u201cuniversal income\u201d and has spoken of cutting the already reduced French workweek, but his chances are thought to be lowered by the presence of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, whose positions are largely similar."}
