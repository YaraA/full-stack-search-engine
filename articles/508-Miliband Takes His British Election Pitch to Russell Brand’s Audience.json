It was called \u201cMilibrand: The Interview.\u201d\n\nThe two men discussed issues ranging from the power of bankers and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, to London\u2019s housing crisis and inequality. Mr. Miliband argued that politicians matter and citizens should vote, rejecting Mr. Brand\u2019s view that bankers are more powerful than politicians and that voting is an exercise in futility.\n\n\u201cWe all got excited by Tony Blair, we all got excited by Barack Obama and what happened?\u201d Mr. Brand asked. \u201cThe reason I have never voted in my life is because I think it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nMr. Miliband, not surprisingly, argued that it does. \u201cProgress comes from people demanding change, politics responding, not all the way, and people pushing for that change to carry on,\u201d Mr. Miliband said. \u201cBut without politics, without government, the change doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nIn a typical exchange, Mr. Brand said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want some sort of giddy \u2018Yes we can\u2019 euphoria, we want a bloke who is going to say, \u2018I\u2019m in this for the right reasons.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Right? It ain\u2019t gonna be like that. Change is hard, right? Change takes time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe right-wing Sun, still Britain\u2019s most popular newspaper, said in an editorial that \u201cif there are possible votes in it, Miliband\u2019s there \u2014 spouting off in a comical Mockney accent,\u201d a fake Cockney accent, \u201cabout sticking it to the tax-dodging corporations.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron, the Conservative Party leader, said earlier: \u201cRussell Brand is a joke. Ed Miliband, to hang out with Russell Brand, he\u2019s a joke.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Miliband was unbowed. He told reporters, \u201cI will do anything and engage with anyone to try and persuade people to vote.\u201d And his supporters, including the Guardian commentator Owen Jones, praised his effort to reach those Britons who feel alienated by politicians and the system in general.\n\nIn a coda to the interview, Mr. Brand praised Mr. Miliband for being \u201cprepared to come round here and talk to us.\u201d\n\nThe interview drowned out Mr. Cameron\u2019s vow on Wednesday to introduce a law guaranteeing no rise in income tax rates, value-added tax or national insurance before 2020 if his party wins the election.\n\nThe Labour Party dismissed Mr. Cameron\u2019s pledge as a \u201clast-minute gimmick,\u201d and said that the Conservatives had a \u201csecret plan\u201d to cut tax credits for families and raise the value-added tax. Labour even put together a website, torysecretplan.com, which features a fake email to Mr. Cameron from George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, laying out cuts not to be announced until after the election.\n\nOpinion polls suggest a hung Parliament, with no party winning an absolute majority, and the two main parties, the Conservatives and Labour, splitting about two-thirds of the vote.", "summary": "The two men discussed issues ranging from the power of bankers and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, to London\u2019s housing crisis and inequality.Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.Prime Minister David Cameron, the Conservative Party leader, said earlier: \u201cRussell Brand is a joke.He told reporters, \u201cI will do anything and engage with anyone to try and persuade people to vote.\u201d And his supporters, including the Guardian commentator Owen Jones, praised his effort to reach those Britons who feel alienated by politicians and the system in general.Labour even put together a website, torysecretplan.com, which features a fake email to Mr. Cameron from George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, laying out cuts not to be announced until after the election."}
