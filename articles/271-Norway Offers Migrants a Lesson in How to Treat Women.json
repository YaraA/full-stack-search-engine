The German region of Bavaria, the main entry point to Germany for asylum seekers, is already experimenting with such classes at a shelter for teenage migrants in the town of Passau.\n\nNorway, however, has been leading the way. Its immigration department mandated that such programs be offered nationwide in 2013, and hired a nonprofit foundation, Alternative to Violence, to train refugee center workers in how to organize and conduct classes on sexual and other forms of violence. The government provided funding for two years to pay for interpreters for the classes and is now reviewing the results and whether to extend its support.\n\n\u201cThe biggest danger for everyone is silence,\u201d said Per Isdal, a clinical psychologist in Stavanger who works with the foundation, which developed the program Mr. Kelifa attended in Sandes.\n\nMany refugees \u201ccome from cultures that are not gender equal and where women are the property of men,\u201d Mr. Isdal said. \u201cWe have to help them adapt to their new culture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first such program to teach immigrants about local norms and how to avoid misreading social signals was initiated in Stavanger, the center of Norway\u2019s oil industry and a magnet for migrants, after a series of rapes from 2009 to 2011.\n\nHenry Ove Berg, who was Stavanger\u2019s police chief during the spike in rape cases, said he supported providing migrants sex education because \u201cpeople from some parts of the world have never seen a girl in a miniskirt, only in a burqa.\u201d When they get to Norway, he added, \u201csomething happens in their heads.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cthere was a link but not a very clear link\u201d between the rape cases and the city\u2019s immigrant community. According to the state broadcaster, NRK, which reviewed court documents, only three of 20 men found guilty in those cases were native Norwegians, the rest immigrants.\n\nThe claim that refugees and immigrants in general are prone to commit rape has become a main rallying cry of anti-migrant activists across Europe, with each case of sexual violence by a newcomer presented as evidence of an imported scourge.\n\nHege Storhaug, a former Norwegian journalist who runs Human Rights Service, an organization fiercely critical of Islam, has seized on the issue to rally public opposition to refugees, asserting on her group\u2019s website that Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had opened the way to an \u201cepidemic of rape\u201d with her welcoming approach to migrants.\n\nPhoto\n\nNorway, like most European countries, does not break down crime statistics by ethnicity or religion. A 2011 report by Norway\u2019s state statistical bureau noted that \u201cimmigrants are overrepresented in the crime statistics\u201d but suggested that this was not due to cultural differences but because many of the immigrants were young men.\n\n\u201cIt should not be surprising if groups with large proportions of young males have higher crime rates than groups with large proportions elderly women,\u201d the report said.\n\nHanne Kristin Rohde, a former head of the violent crime section of the Oslo Police Department, said she ran into a wall of hostility when, in 2011 while still in the police force, she blamed sexual violence by foreign men on cultural factors and went public with data suggesting that immigrants committed a hugely disproportionate number of rapes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Last month, the German interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, said that asylum seekers were no more prone to crime, including sexual violence, than Germans.\n\n\u201cIn general, the available recent trend findings show that refugees commit just as few or as many crimes as groups of the local population,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kelifa, the African asylum seeker, said he still had a hard time accepting that a wife could accuse her husband of sexual assault. But he added that he had learned how to read previously baffling signals from women who wear short skirts, smile or simply walk alone at night without an escort.\n\n\u201cMen have weaknesses and when they see someone smiling it is difficult to control,\u201d Mr. Kelifa said, explaining that in his own country, Eritrea, \u201cif someone wants a lady he can just take her and he will not be punished,\u201d at least not by the police.\n\nNorway, he said, treats women differently. \u201cThey can do any job from prime minister to truck driver and have the right to relax\u201d in bars or on the street without being bothered, he added.\n\nMr. Isdal, the Stavanger psychologist, said refugees, particularly those traumatized by war, represent a \u201crisk group\u201d that is not predestined to violent crime but that does need help to cope with a new and alien environment.\n\nThe program he helped design focuses on getting newly arrived refugees to open up about their attitudes toward sex, through discussions in small groups supervised by a monitor, usually a native Norwegian. A manual prepared for the course includes sections on \u201cNorwegian laws and values,\u201d as well as violence against children and women.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA class held on Wednesday in Lunde, a village southwest of Oslo, focused on differing perceptions of \u201chonor\u201d and how violence that might be seen as honorable in some cultures is shameful and also illegal in Norway.\n\nA rival program, developed by a private company called Hero Norge, which runs asylum centers under a contract with the government, also promotes discussion as the best way to expose and break down views that can lead to trouble.\n\nHero Norge\u2019s teaching material studiously avoids casting migrants in a bad light and instead presents a fictional character called Arne, a native Norwegian, as a model of predatory behavior. The main immigrant character, a 27-year-old called Hassan, is, by contrast, introduced as a \u201cgood man\u201d who is \u201chonest and well liked.\u201d\n\nIn one episode, Arne, the Norwegian, tells Hassan he plans to ply a young woman with alcoholic drinks \u201cto soften her up.\u201d People taking the course are asked questions such as: \u201cHow should Hassan react?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think Arne means when he says he wants to \u2018soften her up?\u2019 \u201d \u201cIs it O.K. to \u2018soften someone up\u2019 with alcohol?\u201d\n\nBerit Harr, a course monitor at a refugee center in Ha, a coastal village south of Stavanger, said it was important to avoid making migrants feel as if they were under suspicion while getting them to talk about their own views on relations between the sexes.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to talk about sex,\u201d she said. But, she added, doing so can help refugees navigate potentially dangerous situations in a strange land.\n\n\u201cIt is normal here for boys and girls to be friends,\u201d she said. \u201cSmiling and flirting are normal. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. If a girl is drunk it does not mean she is willing to do anything.\u201d", "summary": "Henry Ove Berg, who was Stavanger\u2019s police chief during the spike in rape cases, said he supported providing migrants sex education because \u201cpeople from some parts of the world have never seen a girl in a miniskirt, only in a burqa.\u201d When they get to Norway, he added, \u201csomething happens in their heads.\u201d Hege Storhaug, a former Norwegian journalist who runs Human Rights Service, an organization fiercely critical of Islam, has seized on the issue to rally public opposition to refugees, asserting on her group\u2019s website that Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had opened the way to an \u201cepidemic of rape\u201d with her welcoming approach to migrants.
