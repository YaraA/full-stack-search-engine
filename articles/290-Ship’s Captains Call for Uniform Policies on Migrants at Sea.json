Prosecutions of sea captains who rescue migrants at sea for aiding illegal immigration are rare, said James Kraska, a professor of international law at the United States Naval War College in Newport, R.I.\n\nNaval ships are as much subject to international conventions on search and rescue as merchant ships, he said. And ship captains and owners can be caught between competing authorities. \u201cIt\u2019s a clash between the international law of the sea and national laws governing immigration, and the European Union has no single law,\u201d he said.\n\nThe problem comes, he said, when state authorities refuse to take over and exercise their own obligations to those who have been rescued. In the case of Italy and Greece, Dr. Kraska said, \u201csometimes they feel overwhelmed,\u201d and there are often political considerations in countries where political parties opposed to generous immigration policies are gaining ground.\n\n\u201cYou cannot ignore a distress signal,\u201d said James Gosling, a maritime lawyer at Holman Fenwick Willan in London. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic precept of law.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Customary law is just as binding as treaty law, and there are a number of treaties and conventions that obligate ship captains and masters to come to the aid of those in need.\n\nInternational statutes include the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in force since 1994; the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, in force since 1980; and the 1979 International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, in force since 1985.\n\nBut the surge of illegal migration and the threat of piracy mean that \u201cthe current attitude of many state parties \u2014 particularly heightened by the era of terrorism and increase in migration flows (Horn of Africa) \u2014 makes it difficult to enforce the obligations,\u201d according to the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat, an advocacy group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat is required, the group said, is \u201ca change in attitude by coastal states to reflect a more genuine balance between security interests and the need to assist master/captains who have gone out of their way to fulfill their obligation to assist and rescue persons \u2014 asylum seekers and irregular migrants, who are the most likely to expose themselves to such dangers \u2014 in distress at sea.\u201d\n\nThe International Organization for Migration suggested that \u201cthe lack of a uniform approach to human rights and refugee law and the law of the sea allows states to favor minimum compliance with maritime rules over the bona fide fulfillment of international protection obligations.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Chamber of Shipping and the European Community Shipowners\u2019 Associations said in a joint statement that the authorities must clamp down on criminal people-smugglers and the root causes of the migrant flows from Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\n\u201cBut the urgent and immediate priority is for E.U. member states to increase resources for search-and-rescue operations before thousands more people die,\u201d said Patrick Verhoeven, the secretary general of the shipowners\u2019 group.", "summary": "\u201cYou cannot ignore a distress signal,\u201d said James Gosling, a maritime lawyer at Holman Fenwick Willan in London.
