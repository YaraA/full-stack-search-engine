Mr. Funke said he thought that voters in Europe were looking at Brexit and the Trump presidency not as points of inspiration, but rather with deep concern.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere is no Trump effect,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing happened.\u201d On the current moment for populist parties, he said, \u201cI see stagnation, or decline.\u201d\n\nIn the Netherlands, Mr. Funke noted, Geert Wilders, one of the most stridently anti-Muslim politicians in Europe, has struggled to improve his standing in recent weeks after climbing quickly in the polls.\n\n\u201cThere is a danger that it can go out of control, as far as the voting for Wilders,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I doubt that will be the case.\u201d\n\nEven if populists like Mr. Wilders do not prevail, other analysts said, their high profiles and often inflammatory presence had moved much of the political debate to the far right\u2019s turf. The battle in many ways is already won.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSince the entrance of Geert Wilders into the political arena, he hasn\u2019t had any office but he has exerted influence,\u201d said Bert Bakker, a communications professor at the University of Amsterdam.\n\nDiscussions in the Netherlands now often center on restrictions on immigrants, identity politics and nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One result is that the far right\u2019s views have dominated the debate, crowding out other views and issues.\n\n\u201cEven if these parties are not actually winning or part of the government, everything is moving to a more anti-immigration stance, more pro-nationalist, to try to win voters who are the losers in globalization,\u201d said Jasper Muis, a professor of sociology at the Free University of Amsterdam, who studies populism.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cImmigration and asylum seekers become the focus on the one hand and values and norms on the others,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not much is said about economic development or employment and that\u2019s a part of the success story of the populist right: that they\u2019ve been able to make it difficult to talk about other subjects.\u201d\n\nIn the most optimistic outlooks, Mr. Wilders, who heads the Freedom Party, will get about 15 percent of the vote. Even if his votes were combined with those of other far-right and anti-establishment parties, the combined number of likely seats in the 150-seat Parliament would not exceed about 30, or 20 percent of the Parliament.\n\nHowever, the Christian Democratic Appeal party is promoting a line almost as conservative on immigration as that of Mr. Wilders, a change from its more moderate position of several years ago. That party now looks likely to win about as many seats as Mr. Wilders, and if the mainstream right\u2019s seats are added to that, the far-right and center-right parties would have a majority.\n\nEven if the right has dominated the campaign, the reality is that the Netherlands is deeply divided and its centrist parties are losing ground in an increasingly fractured political landscape.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are 28 parties on the ballot. Only between 10 and 12 will get enough votes to win a seat in Parliament. There are still likely to be four or five parties in the governing coalition \u2014 all but guaranteeing it will include both left- and right-leaning parties.\n\nFor that reason some experienced observers of European politics say the rightward drift by the Dutch may be more important as a harbinger of trends on the Continent than for its practical impact.\n\nSome analysts are far more worried about the French vote, because the far-right leader of the National Front, the presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, has a bloc of voters that is much more solidified behind her.\n\n\u201cThe bloc for Le Pen is very consistent, which is different than the other populists,\u201d said Mr. Funke of the Free University in Berlin.\n\nAn even greater concern may be Italy, where the populist Five Star party and the Northern League could win if elections are held, in part on a platform proposing a referendum on whether Italy should continue to use the euro. That could trigger a loss of confidence by foreign investors and capital flight from the Continent.\n\n\u201cItaly is potentially the worst case because if they are forced by election results to have a euro referendum,\u201d Mr. Funke said, \u201cthen there would be a big danger.\u201d", "summary": "In the Netherlands, Mr. Funke noted, Geert Wilders, one of the most stridently anti-Muslim politicians in Europe, has struggled to improve his standing in recent weeks after climbing quickly in the polls. \u201cSince the entrance of Geert Wilders into the political arena, he hasn\u2019t had any office but he has exerted influence,\u201d said Bert Bakker, a communications professor at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cImmigration and asylum seekers become the focus on the one hand and values and norms on the others,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not much is said about economic development or employment and that\u2019s a part of the success story of the populist right: that they\u2019ve been able to make it difficult to talk about other subjects.\u201d Some analysts are far more worried about the French vote, because the far-right leader of the National Front, the presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, has a bloc of voters that is much more solidified behind her."}
