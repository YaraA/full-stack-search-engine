Last week, a Saudi researcher and language student was stabbed to death in a park in Colchester, north of London, with the police saying she may have been attacked because she wore traditional Islamic garb.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast month there was a brief uproar over whether supermarkets and restaurants in Britain needed to disclose when they used halal meat, from animals slaughtered according to Muslim rules. And the inspections of 21 schools in Birmingham after the widespread publication of the anonymous letter documented enough concerns to keep the issue in the news and the government on guard: Some teachers appeared to actively discourage girls from speaking to boys, and one school offered class trips to Mecca subsidized with taxpayers\u2019 money. One teacher, apparently afraid to be seen talking with the inspectors, asked to meet them in a supermarket parking lot.\n\nAt Park View, too, inspectors said, some members of the staff were afraid to speak up. They criticized that boys and girls were taught separately in religious education and pupil development classes, and they said the provision of sexual education was insufficient.\n\nThere was, the inspectors concluded, \u201ca culture of fear and intimidation\u201d in the schools.\n\nBut in Birmingham, where more than one in five inhabitants are Muslim, many residents said they are the ones being intimidated. They pointed to the response of the education secretary, Michael Gove, who said he wanted to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of extremism and appointed a former counterterrorism chief to investigate. They noted that Prime Minister David Cameron has instructed all schools to start teaching \u201cBritish values\u201d in the fall. The message to the community is clear, said Hardeep Saini, executive principal of Park View: \u201cConservative Muslims are extremists, and their schools are un-British.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to Muslims, said Chris Allen of Birmingham University, open suspicion now passes the test of respectability.\n\n\u201cIt has become quite acceptable to blur the line between devout Muslims and extremists, and from there it\u2019s only a short mental jump to militancy,\u201d said Mr. Allen, author of \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d a book about anti-Muslim sentiment in Britain.\n\nUntangling religiousness from extremism has proved especially tricky in a country that, unlike the United States, has never drawn a clear line between the state and religion: The queen is both head of state and head of the Anglican Church. Public schools, while nondenominational, traditionally offer the opportunity for collective Christian worship.\n\nPhoto\n\nPark View, where 98 percent of students are from a Muslim background, has won special dispensation to hold Islamic assemblies instead. The school allows for lunchtime prayer and shortens the school day during Ramadan. Head scarves are an optional part of the school uniform, but at least four in five girls wear them. On Fridays, loudspeakers broadcast the call to prayer, which is led by a student.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, we try to accommodate the students\u2019 religion,\u201d said Monzoor Hussain, the acting head teacher of the school, which specializes in math and science. More than half the teachers and the chairman of the school board are Muslims.\n\n\u201cIs there a plot?\u201d Mr. Hussain asked. \u201cYes, the plot has always been to reverse the underperformance of Muslim children in this country and allow them to be both: Muslim and British.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On one recent afternoon, two girls were simulating a sword fight with plastic rulers, reciting Shakespeare in an English lesson on the first floor. Next door, classwork on Jewish, Christian and Muslim birthing ceremonies decorated the back wall.\n\nIn a senior-year advanced physics class down the hall, 22 out of the 29 students were girls. Zainab Din, 15, recently won fourth place in a science competition at the University of Birmingham. She wants to study physics or English. On her lapel is a pin that says \u201centrepreneur\u201d because she has been selling poppies to commemorate World War I in a school pop-up shop.\n\n\u201cWhat I want people to understand,\u201d said Mr. Hussain, \u201cis that what we have achieved is not despite making allowances for the Muslim faith, but because of it. Parents trust us and children can be themselves.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is, he said, a constant tug of war about how much religion is too much. When some students asked to use the loudspeakers in the schoolyard for a Friday call to prayer and requested ablution rooms to wash their feet before praying, they got their way. But when parents demanded that the school ban all music, they did not. Last year Mr. Hussain disciplined a teacher who told students they had to pray.\n\nOnce, a girl came to him because her family wanted to marry her off against her will. She bared a forearm covered in cuts, evidence of her desperation. After he spoke to the girl\u2019s parents, they allowed her to finish school. She is now studying law, he said. Time and time again, Mr. Hussain has told fathers who insist that their daughters have to wear the head scarf that it is the girls\u2019 choice. One female student, pressured by her father to wear it outside of school, takes it off during school hours.\n\nWhat worries Mr. Hussain most is that the current news media attention will erode parents\u2019 trust and students\u2019 confidence. Some students have seen summer internships canceled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the mosque down the road, Tehmoor Qaisar said he shares some of the government\u2019s concerns. \u201cWho knows what\u2019s really going on inside the school,\u201d said Mr. Qaisar, who teaches the Quran to some children from Park View after school. \u201cI agree with the government when it investigates serious allegations of radicalization.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cWhat I don\u2019t agree with is the tone.\u201d Alienate young Muslims, and they will start listening to the wrong people, he said.\n\n\u201cNot everyone with a beard is a terrorist,\u201d Mr. Qaisar said, stroking his own neatly trimmed facial hair.\n\nBut stereotypes die hard.\n\nIn the schoolyard, a helicopter was circling overhead, forcing 15-year-old Hayad Hassan to raise her voice. \u201cWhen I think of extremists, I can\u2019t help it,\u201d she said, \u201cI also think of guys with beards.\u201d"}
