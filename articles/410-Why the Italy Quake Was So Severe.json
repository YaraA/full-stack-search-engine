Many people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings.\n\nKey Facts\n\nLike other villages and towns in the mountainous area, Amatrice, where the mayor lamented that \u201chalf the town no longer exists,\u201d has stone churches and other buildings that were constructed centuries ago, when little if anything was known about earthquakes. Unless they have been reinforced in recent years, such structures are easily damaged or destroyed by shaking.\n\n\u201cEven 100 years ago, they didn\u2019t know how to build structures to withstand earthquakes,\u201d said David A. Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at the Open University in Milton Keynes, England.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe earthquake was less powerful than many recent deadly quakes. The magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Nepal in April 2015, for instance, killing 8,000 people, released roughly 250 times more energy.\n\nVideo\n\nBut the Italian quake was very shallow: According to the United States Geological Survey, it occurred about six miles below the surface. \u201cShallow earthquakes cause more destruction than deep earthquakes because the shallowness of the source makes the ground-shaking at the surface worse,\u201d Professor Rothery said."}
