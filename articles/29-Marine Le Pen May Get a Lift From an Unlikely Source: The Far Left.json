{"title": "Marine Le Pen May Get a Lift From an Unlikely Source: The Far Left", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/world/europe/france-melenchon-macron-le-pen.html", "body": "Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s 19.6 percent of the vote Sunday is now a rich booty \u2014 triple the score of the mainstream Socialist Party, whose collapse has elevated Mr. M\u00e9lenchon to be de facto leader of the French left. He even won in big cities like Marseille and Lille.\n\nBut it is not clear where that vote will now go, not least because far-left populism and far-right populism may have more in common than the seemingly vast gulf between them on the political spectrum would suggest.\n\nMr. M\u00e9lenchon, 65, a former Trotskyite, ran a campaign denouncing banks, globalization and the European Union \u2014 just like Ms. Le Pen.\n\nA grizzled orator with a penchant for Latin American dictators, he has the same forgiving attitude she does toward the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nPhoto\n\nBoth were competing for working-class voters suspicious of the global financial elite. Mr. Macron had already \u201cruined the lives of thousands of people\u201d with his pro-market policies, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said during the campaign.\n\nAnd like Ms. Le Pen, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon regularly attacked the news media during the campaign. On election night, after his defeat, he tore into what he called \u201cmediacrats\u201d and \u201coligarchs.\u201d They were \u201crejoicing\u201d over \u201ctwo candidates who approve and want to maintain the current institutions\u201d of government, the longtime fan of Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez said.\n\nThe shared lines of attack gave the candidates at the political extremes their best showings ever, if from opposite ends of the spectrum. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon almost doubled his 2012 result, refused to concede for hours and then attacked both finalists, refusing to distinguish between them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn that, he is alone. Across the board, politicians and other former candidates have urgently counseled their supporters to vote for Mr. Macron to block Ms. Le Pen\u2019s path to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nThe French call this the \u201cRepublican Front,\u201d and it has proved effective at preventing the National Front \u2014 perceived by many in France as a threat to democracy \u2014 from taking power before.\n\nMr. M\u00e9lenchon is having none of it.\n\nInstead, his party has announced an internet \u201cconsultation\u201d of his followers, with three choices offered for the May 7 vote: a blank ballot, a vote for Mr. Macron or an abstention. A vote for Ms. Le Pen is not one of the choices, and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s aides insist that is the last thing they want.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s led him to make an extremely serious mistake,\u201d a leading Socialist member of Parliament, Malek Boutih, said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s given them a huge boost,\u201d he said of the National Front.\n\n\u201cThis gesture of M\u00e9lenchon, it\u2019s exactly like the political behavior of the whole European far left,\u201d added Mr. Boutih, who is part of the centrist bloc Mr. M\u00e9lenchon despises. \u201cThe radical left has a problem with democratic culture. It\u2019s a new force, but with old Stalinist ideas.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe National Front is delighted. The party has extended a welcome mat to Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s supporters, pointing out similarities between the candidates.\n\nThe Front\u2019s founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2014 kicked out of the party by his daughter partly over his racism \u2014 hailed Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s position warmly in an interview on French radio Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis seems very worthy to me, coming from a candidate who made a remarkable breakthrough, and who was \u2014 it must be said \u2014 the best orator,\u201d Mr. Le Pen said.\n\nHis daughter\u2019s top lieutenant in the far-right party, Florian Philippot, said \u201cmany voters\u201d for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon may now join Ms. Le Pen in the second round, adding that there was a \u201ca kind of coherence, after all\u201d in his refusal to endorse Mr. Macron.\n\n\u201cAmong his voters, many will refuse to vote for Macron, and many could vote for us,\u201d Mr. Philippot said on France Info, tying the former economy minister to \u201cfinance,\u201d as Mr. M\u00e9lenchon does, and to the unpopular government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in which Mr. Macron served.\n\n\u201cLots of voters in the electorate that chose Fillon, Dupont-Aignan\u201d \u2014 two candidates on the right \u2014 \u201cand even M\u00e9lenchon are open to a number of our themes,\u201d another top National Front official, Nicolas Bay, said in an internal memo quoted by Agence France-Presse on Tuesday.\n\nThe coming vote would be a contest between \u201cfans of Mrs. Merkel and the unsubjugated,\u201d he wrote \u2014 an apparent reference to Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s movement and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is criticized on both the far left and the far right as pursuing policies that have impoverished European Union states.\n\nOne of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s top aides derided the candidate\u2019s critics in a telephone interview Tuesday. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at where the criticism is coming from,\u201d said \u00c9ric Coquerel, a member of the Paris regional council.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming from those whose policies have favored the development of the National Front, from the Socialist Party,\u201d said Mr. Coquerel, referring to the quarrel that divided the French left for five years: the governing Socialists\u2019 mild pro-market turn, seen as a betrayal by France\u2019s far left.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to help Marine Le Pen, but we don\u2019t want to endorse Mr. Macron,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the candidate of free trade,\u201d Mr. Coquerel said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to assist in the Uberization of society. Everything we are going to fight against in the coming months. There\u2019s no possible rapprochement.\u201d", "summary": "On election night, after his defeat, he tore into what he called \u201cmediacrats\u201d and \u201coligarchs.\u201d They were \u201crejoicing\u201d over \u201ctwo candidates who approve and want to maintain the current institutions\u201d of government, the longtime fan of Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez said.
