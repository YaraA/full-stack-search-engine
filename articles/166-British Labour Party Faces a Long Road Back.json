Add to that a new acrimony over the strong role that trade unions play in the Labour Party, which after all was begun as the political wing of the unions, and in particular the role of Len McCluskey, head of Unite, a powerful union.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Mr. Murphy, like Mr. Miliband, was right to resign after such a catastrophe, but he did so blasting the influence of Mr. McCluskey.\n\nA former dockworker from Liverpool, Mr. McCluskey believes that Labour has become divorced from workers and should move further to the left.\n\nBut in Scotland, Labour was hit with identity politics and nationalism from a Scottish National Party that was also further to the left, rhetorically at least. In England, Mr. Miliband was considered too left-wing, and the Conservatives portrayed him as a weak leader dependent on Scottish separatists who only cared about the poor and could not be trusted to control government spending.\n\nMany Labour voters in the north, upset about immigration, voted for the U.K. Independence Party. Some who were further to the left, or were disappointed with Mr. Miliband, drifted to the Green Party, which got 3.8 percent of the vote.\n\nIt is a measure of Labour\u2019s difficulties that even if one includes the 41 seats it had in Scotland \u2014 now just one \u2014 the party would not have won this election, not even close. David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives would still have won a majority.\n\nAs for the Conservatives, they managed to eat the lunch and dinner of their coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, who dropped to eight seats from 57, with only 7.9 percent of the vote. They are having their own leadership battle and are even considering a name change.\n\nThe other great post-election drama surrounds the U.K. Independence Party and its leader, Nigel Farage. The party won 12.6 percent of the vote but only one seat, though it came second in 120 others. Mr. Farage lost his own bid and, as promised, resigned as leader, though he quickly reversed himself, prompting extensive internal criticism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUKIP without the telegenic Mr. Farage is not very compelling. But even with him, the party may not have a future. Its central issues are connected: immigration controls and a British withdrawal from the European Union. Mr. Cameron will have a referendum. If Britain votes to go its own way, UKIP is done; if Britain stays, the issue is resolved, and what else is UKIP for?", "summary": "It was Mr. McCluskey who pushed Ed Miliband into the leadership and who just ordered Jim Murphy, the leader of the routed Scottish Labour Party, to resign.
