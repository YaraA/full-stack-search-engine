Opposition parties had offered 44 amendments, but they were all rejected. On Thursday afternoon, it passed the Sejm, the lower house of Parliament, but it still must pass the Senate and be signed by Mr. Duda.\n\nThe bill reduces the number of judges who must be present to hear cases, one of the criticisms that had been leveled over the previous law, but adds other provisions that critics say are intended to continue hobbling the court.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
