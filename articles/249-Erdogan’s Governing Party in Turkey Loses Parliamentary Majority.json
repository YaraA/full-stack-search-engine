Party is the backbone of Turkey,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Erdogan, who as president was not on the ballot Sunday, will probably remain Turkey\u2019s dominant political figure even if his ambitions have been curtailed, given his outsize personality and his still-deep well of support among Turkey\u2019s religious conservatives, who form the backbone of his constituency. But even among those supporters, including ones in Kasimpasa, the Istanbul neighborhood where Mr. Erdogan spent part of his youth, there are signs that his popularity is flagging.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in Kasimpasa have become disheartened by Erdogan\u2019s aggressive approach in recent weeks,\u201d said Aydin, 77, who gave only his first name because some of his family members are close to Mr. Erdogan. \u201cI voted for the A.K.P. because it has become habit, but I think Erdogan lost votes this week.\u201d\n\nTurnout was 86 percent for the elections, which were seen as a referendum on Mr. Erdogan\u2019s tenure, especially his plan for a presidential system that would have given him more power. Polling had consistently shown that the majority of Turks are opposed to the change.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy law, Mr. Erdogan can call for new elections after 45 days if a coalition is not formed, and the political uncertainty sent Turkey\u2019s currency, the lira, to a record low against the dollar in after-hours trading.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe vote turned on the historic performance at the ballot box of Turkey\u2019s Kurdish minority, which aligned with liberals and secular Turks opposed to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s leadership to win almost 13 percent of the vote, passing the legal threshold for earning representation in Parliament.\n\nSelahattin Demirtas, 42, a former human rights lawyer who leads the largely Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party, told reporters Sunday night: \u201cAs of this hour, the debate about the presidency, the debate about dictatorship, is over. Turkey narrowly averted a disaster.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party, known as H.D.P., was able to broaden its base by fielding a slate of candidates that included women, gays and other minorities and appealed to voters whose goal was to curtail Mr. Erdogan\u2019s powers.\n\n\u201cI voted for H.D.P. because it\u2019s the only party that can break up Erdogan\u2019s bid for absolute power,\u201d said Selen Olcay, 47, a fitness instructor who voted in Istanbul\u2019s Sariyer District. \u201cIn this election a lot of Turks abandoned their ideological preferences and voted strategically to derail Erdogan\u2019s one-man rule.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish party opted to run a unified slate, rather than field independent candidates as it had in the past. But it was a big risk: either it would reach the 10 percent threshold and enter Parliament, or it would be shut out, and its seats would have gone to the A.K.P.\n\nVideo\n\nIn the city of Diyarbakir, in the Kurdish heartland in the southeast, celebrations broke out as people flooded the streets, dancing and setting off fireworks.\n\nIn Istanbul, Kurds saw the election as the culmination of decades of struggle, some of it waged violently by the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which has fought an insurgency from a base in northern Iraq for more political rights. In recent years Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government had entered peace talks with the Kurds and violence ebbed, and Sunday\u2019s vote raised hopes for a final deal.\n\n\u201cThis is the victory of peace against war,\u201d said Sirri Sureyya Onder, an H.D.P. official, speaking to a group of reporters after preliminary results were published.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It also highlighted the evolution of the Kurdish movement, from the battlefields of the southeast, where a bloody insurgency raged for nearly 30 years, to the halls of power in Ankara, the capital.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven as days of political bargaining lie ahead, the elections capped a two-year period of seismic shifts in Turkish politics. Widespread antigovernment protests in 2013, set off by plans to raze an Istanbul park and replace it with a mall, laid bare the growing resentments among liberal and secular Turks toward the governing party. Then, a corruption scandal threatened to engulf Mr. Erdogan and his government. Mr. Erdogan survived by targeting the followers of his erstwhile ally, the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who over the years had taken positions in the judiciary and the police and were accused of orchestrating a graft inquiry.\n\nTurkey has felt strains in other arenas. It has taken in nearly two million Syrians, who have been a burden on services and exacerbated tensions in border regions, especially as the economy has slowed. In the wake of the Arab Spring, Turkey pursued an Islamist agenda in the region, supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, whose president was deposed by the military. Its policy in Syria of pushing for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad has been unpopular in Turkey, and Mr. Assad, four years later, is still in power.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe diminished power of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party is likely to rein in Turkey\u2019s ambitions to shape events in the Middle East, an activist foreign policy that has been controversial among political opponents and the public.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s foreign policy will be less driven by the A.K.P.\u2019s ambitions, which is basically driven by a foreign policy vision to make Turkey a regional player at any cost,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said, suggesting it had supported various Syrian factions opposing the Assad government and sometimes turned a blind eye to fighters crossing into Syria to join the Islamic State.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe outcome of the election will take Turkey\u2019s anti-Assad policy down a notch. The government will not be able to drive its agenda single-handedly anymore.\u201d\n\nTurkey, a member of NATO, has seen its relations with its Western allies deteriorate, mainly over Syria and the fight against the Islamic State, the militant group that controls vast areas of Iraq and Syria. An American-led coalition has been carrying out an air campaign against the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, for nearly a year, but Western officials complain that Turkey has not done enough, such as allowing its air bases to be used for bombing runs. Critics also partly blame Turkey for the rise of the Islamic State for its early support of Islamist groups in Syria.\n\nThe election was defined by bitter partisanship, with opponents criticizing Mr. Erdogan for his accumulation of powers, his bashing of the news media and his lavish new official residence, which Mr. Erdogan justified by saying his previous residence was infested with cockroaches. The campaign was also marred by violence, including a bombing last week at a Kurdish political rally that left two people dead.\n\n\u201cErdogan\u2019s salvos over the past week show how nervous he is about the outcome of this election,\u201d said Ugur Kaplan, 24, a student who voted in Istanbul.\n\n\u201cThe A.K.P. has lost votes, and it\u2019s because of him. People are tired of having their lives dictated by one nutty man. It\u2019s time for change.\u201d", "summary": "The People\u2019s Democratic Party, known as H.D.P., was able to broaden its base by fielding a slate of candidates that included women, gays and other minorities and appealed to voters whose goal was to curtail Mr. Erdogan\u2019s powers.In Istanbul, Kurds saw the election as the culmination of decades of struggle, some of it waged violently by the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which has fought an insurgency from a base in northern Iraq for more political rights.Widespread antigovernment protests in 2013, set off by plans to raze an Istanbul park and replace it with a mall, laid bare the growing resentments among liberal and secular Turks toward the governing party.Mr. Erdogan survived by targeting the followers of his erstwhile ally, the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who over the years had taken positions in the judiciary and the police and were accused of orchestrating a graft inquiry.The diminished power of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party is likely to rein in Turkey\u2019s ambitions to shape events in the Middle East, an activist foreign policy that has been controversial among political opponents and the public."}
