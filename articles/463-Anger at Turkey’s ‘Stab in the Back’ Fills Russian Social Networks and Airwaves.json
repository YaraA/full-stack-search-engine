The Russian ambassador in Ankara was summoned to the Turkish Foreign Ministry last week and was warned that the anti-Assad forces in northwestern Syria near the Turkish border were from the Turkmen ethnic minority, and not the Islamic State.\n\nWhen pro-Kremlin activists protested at the Turkish Embassy in Moscow, the online slogan appeared offline as well, showing up on placards at a rally that lasted into the evening.\n\nOne well-known Russian nationalist activist at the protest outside the embassy, Maria Katasonova, later upped the ante by switching to another tag, #TurkeyISIS, inspired by Mr. Putin\u2019s question about whether the Turkish military had acted in support of Islamic State militants.", "summary": "Within a few minutes after President Vladimir V.
