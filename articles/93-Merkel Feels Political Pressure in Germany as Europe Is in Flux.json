{"title": "Merkel Feels Political Pressure in Germany as Europe Is in Flux", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/world/europe/angela-merkel-germany.html", "body": "If national elections were held now, her conservative bloc would get 33 percent of the vote, according to a Forsa Institute poll of 2,503 selected respondents published on Wednesday. That compares with just over 41 percent in the last national vote in 2013.\n\nAn early indication of the political troubles ahead could arrive on Sunday, when the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has risen largely on popular fears of the mostly Muslim newcomers, threatens to overtake Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union in elections in her political home state.\n\nSuch an outcome would be a stinging rebuke of her migrant policies. Opinion polls show the two parties neck and neck, hovering just over 20 percent in a statistical dead heat in the state, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, one of Germany\u2019s poorest regions in the former East.\n\n\u201cThe failed policy of the chancellor is a stroke of luck for our party,\u201d said Alexander Gauland, a leader of Alternative for Germany. \u201cIt drives voters towards us.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBy opening Germany\u2019s borders to all last year without consulting even one member of Parliament, he added, Ms. Merkel behaved like a dictator. \u201cIt is regarded by just about every European leader as an act of madness,\u201d he said.\n\nIn tacit acknowledgment of critics who say she consulted nobody on the refugee move, Ms. Merkel has embarked on a listening tour of Europe to try to repair relations. In Tallinn, the Estonian prime minister effusively thanked her for her leadership.\n\nBut it was plain in Warsaw, where she met the four Central European leaders who have flatly refused to take in refugees, that she was not among friends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA host of other demands \u2014 from Italy and France for looser purse strings, from Scandinavian and Dutch leaders to beware of fading support for Europe in their countries \u2014 are tugging at Ms. Merkel as she and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France consult the Continent\u2019s leaders.\n\nThey will succeed, at least on paper, in sketching some grand goals for Europe to be announced at a meeting of 27 nations \u2014 all of the bloc\u2019s members save Britain \u2014 in mid-September.\n\nBut no one has so far explained how Europe is likely this time, for example, to reduce youth unemployment, a goal voiced for years and reiterated since Britain voted on June 23 to leave the union.\n\nMissing goals again is not likely to enhance Europeans\u2019 faith in the bloc. \u201cThe chief concern should be for the attractiveness of the union,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.\n\nSecurity, both internal and external, may be one area of action after terrorist attacks in Belgium, France and Germany this year. The French and German interior ministers have announced enhanced security measures that are likely to be adopted across the Continent.\n\nWith Britain, one of Europe\u2019s two nuclear powers, looking for the exit, it is no longer in a position to hamper moves toward what France, Germany and Poland defined this week as \u201ca European civil and military planning and command capacity.\u201d\n\nThat will also require \u201cdevelopment of a strong and competitive defense economy in Europe,\u201d the foreign ministers of the three countries declared.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

She doubted that Ms. Merkel would leave her giant refugee task half-finished, or her party in the lurch, by declining to run.\n\n\u201cIt would be unlike her to leave the party in a mess,\u201d said Ms. Boysen, now a journalist in Berlin. \u201cShe is very much aware of duty.\u201d\n\nShe also emphasized that Ms. Merkel, a trained physicist who entered politics only as Germany unified in 1990, had constantly been underestimated. \u201cShe was not taken seriously,\u201d Ms. Boysen recalled in an interview. \u201cThe subtext was always, \u2018She can\u2019t do it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn defense of her decision last year, Ms. Merkel trumpets her success in forging a European Union pact with Turkey to stanch the flow of refugees into the Balkans. But Turkey has proved a difficult partner, purging thousands of judges, teachers, journalists and human rights campaigners after a failed coup in July.\n\nStill, in an interview with ARD this week, Ms. Merkel could not resist a little smile as she noted that NATO began a mission to save refugees in the Aegean in just five days in the spring, and that the pact with Turkey was negotiated within months.\n\n\u201cMany people said, \u2018We can\u2019t do this,\u2019 and then it got done,\u201d she said.", "summary": "But no one has so far explained how Europe is likely this time, for example, to reduce youth unemployment, a goal voiced for years and reiterated since Britain voted on June 23 to leave the union.With Britain, one of Europe\u2019s two nuclear powers, looking for the exit, it is no longer in a position to hamper moves toward what France, Germany and Poland defined this week as \u201ca European civil and military planning and command capacity.\u201dIn defense of her decision last year, Ms. Merkel trumpets her success in forging a European Union pact with Turkey to stanch the flow of refugees into the Balkans.But Turkey has proved a difficult partner, purging thousands of judges, teachers, journalists and human rights campaigners after a failed coup in July.Still, in an interview with ARD this week, Ms. Merkel could not resist a little smile as she noted that NATO began a mission to save refugees in the Aegean in just five days in the spring, and that the pact with Turkey was negotiated within months."}
