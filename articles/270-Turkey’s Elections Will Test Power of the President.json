He has been compared to Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who similarly dominated his country\u2019s politics from both the offices of president and prime minister.\n\nAt the rally on Saturday, Mr. Erdogan gave a characteristically passionate performance and almost instantly upstaged Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Though under the Constitution the prime minister is the country\u2019s most powerful official, Mr. Davutoglu delivered only a short speech.\n\nMr. Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke expansively about how Turkey had been transformed by his party\u2019s 12-year tenure: upending the old secular order, empowering the religious masses and pushing the army from politics. \u201cTo reverse this nation\u2019s ill fate for 12 years is a conquest,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told the jubilant crowd. \u201cTo successfully pass this turning point on the way to a new Turkey is a conquest.\u201d\n\nAnd then, referring to the coming elections, he added: \u201cGod willing, June 7 will be a conquest.\u201d\n\nMr. Erdogan was once lauded as a reformer for pushing for minority rights, peace with Turkey\u2019s restive Kurds, an overhaul of the economy and membership in the European Union.\n\nBut he has come under increasing criticism for what many describe as a turn toward authoritarian rule. His government has put increasing pressure on the news media and ordered the police to crack down aggressively on peaceful protesters. Judges and prosecutors who were followers of the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally turned rival of Mr. Erdogan, have been removed and arrested. A series of contentious trials of senior officers has pushed the once-dominant military to the sidelines of politics.\n\nCritics say that Mr. Erdogan has been casting aside the secular system that Ataturk built in founding modern Turkey. They say Mr. Erdogan is replacing it with a government based on Islamist values that puts religion at the center of public life.\n\nMr. Erdogan began his speech at the rally by reciting verses from the Quran, bringing tears to the eyes of many supporters. He challenged secular Turks who are uncomfortable with his government by saying, \u201cWe will not give way to those who speak out against our call to prayer,\u201d and the audience responded with shouts of \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d \u2014 God is great.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOpinion polls suggest that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party will easily win the most seats in Parliament on Sunday, but whether it will win enough seats to change the Constitution outright or to hold a constitutional referendum is too close to call.\n\nThe polls indicate that the party\u2019s support has slipped a bit from the last election in 2011, when it received almost half the vote. With economic growth slowing and many liberals who once backed Mr. Erdogan now critical of his authoritarian bent, support for his party is running in the range of 43 to 45 percent, on average.\n\nThat has opened an opportunity for the People\u2019s Democratic Party, a mainly Kurdish bloc known by the initials H.D.P. The party is running on a platform of greater democracy and women\u2019s rights as well as its traditional pro-Kurdish agenda. The party has an energetic campaigner in a charismatic young leader, Selahattin Demirtas.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnalysts say that if the H.D.P. can poll above the 10 percent threshold for gaining seats in Parliament, the governing party would probably be prevented from altering the Constitution to give more power to the president. Polls show support for the Kurdish party at close to 10 percent.\n\n\u201cThe H.D.P\u2019s range of candidates has been very encouraging,\u201d said Duygu Erdem, 27, a resident of Istanbul who works at an advertising agency. \u201cWe need more women, gays and other minorities to bring checks to Parliament\u2019s stagnant Erdogan-loyalist majority.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say one plausible outcome is a bargain involving the two parties: Kurdish support for creating the strong presidential system, in exchange for greater rights for Kurds and a peace deal to end three decades of insurgency in the predominantly Kurdish southeast.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If the party clears the 10 percent hurdle, it will become a recognized bloc with influence in Parliament. But if it falls short, it will get no seats at all. Many voters are concerned that if that happens, Mr. Erdogan would have a free hand and the peace process with the Kurdish rebels would collapse.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Erdogan as being committed to the peace process in any way,\u201d said Svante E. Cornell, an expert on Turkey and an analyst and research director at the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute. \u201cHe is trying to maximize and centralize power and concentrate it in his own hands. A peace process would require the opposite of that.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to attract conservative Kurds away from the H.D.P. late in the campaign, Mr. Erdogan has held rallies in the southeast, sounding the religious themes that have been a hallmark of his career.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was brought up with the Quran,\u201d he told a crowd of Kurds in Diyarbakir, as he waved a Kurdish-language copy of the holy book. \u201cI live my life by the Quran. We know what the place of the Quran is in your life.\u201d\n\nThe election campaign has been marred by violence, with bombings at the offices of the Kurdish party, and by plenty of vitriol, some of it directed at Mr. Erdogan\u2019s new palace.\n\nWhen Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main secular opposition party, claimed on Saturday that the palace featured gold-plated toilet seats, Mr. Erdogan invited him to inspect the bathrooms and vowed to resign if any golden toilet seats were found. Then, news agencies reported, he sued Mr. Kilicdaroglu for slander.", "summary": "Mr. Erdogan\u2019s power has seemed to grow in the presidency, as he consolidated his grip on the judiciary, tightened restrictions on the news media and moved into an immense new presidential palace.Mr. Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke expansively about how Turkey had been transformed by his party\u2019s 12-year tenure: upending the old secular order, empowering the religious masses and pushing the army from politics.Mr. Erdogan was once lauded as a reformer for pushing for minority rights, peace with Turkey\u2019s restive Kurds, an overhaul of the economy and membership in the European Union.He challenged secular Turks who are uncomfortable with his government by saying, \u201cWe will not give way to those who speak out against our call to prayer,\u201d and the audience responded with shouts of \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d \u2014 God is great.With economic growth slowing and many liberals who once backed Mr. Erdogan now critical of his authoritarian bent, support for his party is running in the range of 43 to 45 percent, on average."}
