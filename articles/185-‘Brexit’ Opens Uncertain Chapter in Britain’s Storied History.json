Prime Minister David Cameron promptly announced that he would step aside once his party settled on a successor, setting up a potentially bare-knuckle leadership battle. An early general election is not out of the question.\n\nOnce Britain begins the formal process of withdrawing from the European Union by exercising Article 50 of the treaty that governs membership in the bloc \u2014 a step Mr. Cameron said he would leave to the next prime minister \u2014 it will set off a two-year clock on negotiations, a period in which Britain (including millions of European citizens living in Britain and British citizens living in the European Union) will be in limbo.\n\nAnd if the British Treasury, the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund and the Institute for Fiscal Studies are to be believed, the British economy is in for a severe shock. The Treasury estimates that the British gross domestic product, representing the size of the economy, will fall by 3.5 percent, clobbering tax receipts; that half a million people will lose their jobs; and that housing prices (and thus personal wealth of homeowners) will fall by 10 percent.\n\nThose estimates were criticized by the Leave campaign, including senior members of government, as unfounded fear mongering. Now Britain will find out how accurate they are.\n\nThis vote was a severe shock to Britain\u2019s political class from voters who are angry, confused and deeply distrustful of elites.\n\nThe Labour Party joined Mr. Cameron in campaigning to stay in Europe, as did nearly all the other parties represented in Parliament, with the exception of the Democratic Unionists and the U.K. Independence Party, which was founded on a platform of leaving the European Union. Yet despite that solid wall of establishment voices \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 Britain voted for a fundamental change in direction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe British political class should pay attention,\u201d said Tony Travers, professor of government at the London School of Economics.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of disaffection with both main parties,\u201d he said. In 1955, the Conservatives and Labour won 97.5 percent of the vote, but in last two elections, the two won only about 66 percent of the vote, he said.\n\n\u201cInto that vacuum something else has to move, but what?\u201d Mr. Travers asked. \u201cThe political class has to wonder how to appeal to those who increasingly feel left out of the system, how to stop large numbers of voters feeling cut out of economic change and success.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative Party is already split between traditional establishment figures like Mr. Cameron and others who embraced the anti-elite, anti-immigration posture of the Leave campaign, most prominently the former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and one of Mr. Cameron\u2019s senior cabinet members, Michael Gove.\n\nMr. Cameron also had more centrist views than many in his party\u2019s grass roots, having pushed the Conservatives to back social issues like same-sex marriage and adopt unifying themes like \u201cone-nation Conservatism.\u201d\n\nHe is likely to be replaced by someone more to the right and more anti-European, like Theresa May, the home secretary, or Mr. Johnson, who also thinks of himself as a \u201cone-nation Tory,\u201d but in the Churchillian mode, and has made no secret of his ambition.\n\nAnd the Labour Party must find a way to embrace those working-class voters who are clearly unhappy about the effects of globalization and immigration on their lives and found themselves swayed by the Leave campaign. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was somewhat halfhearted in his support for the \u201cRemain\u201d camp, reflecting his ambivalence about whether staying in Europe would be the right focus when it comes to helping working people.\n\nThis referendum has also displayed a major fissure between Britain\u2019s metropolitan elite and the rest of the country, essentially pitting rich versus poor across the normal party divide.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTwo nations, in short, are staring at each other across a political chasm,\u201d wrote John Harris in the left-leaning Guardian, which supported Remain, but James Bartholomew made the same point in the Spectator magazine, which supported Leave.\n\nThose with a university degree supported Remain in large numbers, according to pre-referendum polls; those with little higher education supported Leave in equally large numbers. Major cities, multicultural and replete with immigrants, tended to support Remain, while the countryside and poorer areas along the eastern coast were strongly for Leave.\n\nPeople over 45, and especially retirees, strongly supported Leave, while younger Britons strongly supported Remain.\n\nThose with cosmopolitan lives and money were afraid to lose it; those whose lives are bounded by England and are struggling with the pressures of globalization and immigration looked for a return to a calmer, more homogeneous past.\n\nSo the divisions are just as much cultural as economic, and they raise serious questions about Britain\u2019s political coherence and unity, and about how long it may take to heal the wounds made or reopened in this noisy, often vicious campaign.\n\nThe referendum also sharply exacerbated tensions within the four countries of the United Kingdom and gave a jolt to English nationalism, already on the rise since the Scottish independence referendum failed in 2014.\n\nIn addition to intensifying demands for another referendum on independence for Scotland, the outcome of the European Union vote may also increase demands in England, which makes up 85 percent of the British population, for its own devolved Parliament to vote on laws concerning only England, just as Parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do now for their regions.\n\nAmid the overwhelming confusion about the next few years, it will take more than a few reassuring words about a festival of democracy to begin to bring Britain back together.\n\nAs Mr. Harris warned, \u201cWe are in a terrible mess, and it is probably going to take decades to even begin to put things right.\u201d"}
