A volunteer for Britain\u2019s Disaster Emergency Committee, she achieved local prominence in 2010, when she led an effort to raise money for flood victims in Pakistan from the Pakistani community in Derby.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe incident comes as the Conservatives are attempting to win back support in England from voters attracted by the nationalist message of the U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, which wants to withdraw from the European Union and curb immigration. Opposition parties have described the UKIP campaign as xenophobic.\n\nEarlier this month, a Labour candidate visiting a village school outside Derby was startled by words of support for UKIP from a 10-year-old boy. Asked why he supported UKIP, the boy said, \u201cto get all the foreigners out of the country.\u201d\n\nMr. Cameron made an impassioned effort to dispel the notion that immigrants are not welcome in a speech on Saturday about British identity. \u201cWe\u2019re a shining example of a country where multiple identities work,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cA country where you can be Welsh and Hindu and British; Northern Irish and Jewish and British.\u201d\n\nThe message of Mr. Cameron\u2019s speech was overshadowed, however, by a gaffe, in which he seemed confused about his own identity, at least in relation to the tribal world of British soccer fans. At one point in the speech, the prime minister seemed to forget which professional soccer club he supports, speaking of his love for West Ham, a team in London, rather than Aston Villa, a Birmingham club he has called himself a fan of in the past. That the two teams wear similar uniforms might explain the mix up, though it seemed to suggest that the politican\u2019s affinity for his club was not very strong.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s flub was widely ridiculed on social networks, where the term #Villagate became a trending topic.\n\nMr. Cameron once explained that he became a fan of Aston Villa at the age of 13, when his uncle, who was the team\u2019s chairman at the time, took him to a match. Many of Mr. Cameron\u2019s detractors, like Alastair Campbell, the former Labour communications director, suggested that the slip was evidence that his professed allegiance was a sham \u2014 part of an effort to appeal to working-class voters and play down his wealthy background.", "summary": "Despite her suspension, Ms. Afsar will remain on the ballot in next week\u2019s election as a Conservative candidate for a seat in the town council of the English city of Derby, BBC News reported.A volunteer for Britain\u2019s Disaster Emergency Committee, she achieved local prominence in 2010, when she led an effort to raise money for flood victims in Pakistan from the Pakistani community in Derby.Earlier this month, a Labour candidate visiting a village school outside Derby was startled by words of support for UKIP from a 10-year-old boy.The message of Mr. Cameron\u2019s speech was overshadowed, however, by a gaffe, in which he seemed confused about his own identity, at least in relation to the tribal world of British soccer fans.Many of Mr. Cameron\u2019s detractors, like Alastair Campbell, the former Labour communications director, suggested that the slip was evidence that his professed allegiance was a sham \u2014 part of an effort to appeal to working-class voters and play down his wealthy background."}
