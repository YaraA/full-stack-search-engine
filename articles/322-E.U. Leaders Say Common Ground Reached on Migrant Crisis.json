Eight million people are displaced inside Syria, and four million people have fled Syria to other countries, notably Jordan, Turkey and Iraq, he added.\n\n\u201cThis means that today we are talking about millions of potential refugees trying to reach Europe, not thousands,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tusk had called the summit meeting as part of an effort to restore some harmony and to forge a united response from fractious leaders as they confront a refugee crisis that has deeply divided the European Union and added fuel to already surging populist politicians who are hostile to immigration.\n\nThat strategy appeared to have been at least partly successful.\n\nMr. Tusk told a separate news conference after the meeting that there were still disagreements but that the \u201cblame game\u201d had been stopped.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Further discussion of that plan \u201cdid not play a role today,\u201d she said.\n\nEven so, tensions surfaced on Wednesday when Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, criticized Greece for failing to do enough to police its borders and prevent unregistered migrants from traveling northward.\n\nIf the Greeks could not manage their frontiers, then the European Union should help them do so, he said.\n\nAsk Us Your Questions About the Refugee Crisis in Europe What would you like to know about the refugee crisis in Europe? * You have 250 characters left.

Under the original European Commission plan, Hungary would have taken none.\n\nSlovakia, which also balked at the plan, must take 802 people.", "summary": "Mr. Tusk had called the summit meeting as part of an effort to restore some harmony and to forge a united response from fractious leaders as they confront a refugee crisis that has deeply divided the European Union and added fuel to already surging populist politicians who are hostile to immigration.
