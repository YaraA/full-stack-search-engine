While the practice has its critics, some pollsters say people are more likely to acknowledge that they are voting for a far-right party like the National Front if they are doing so by clicking a box on a website rather than if they are being asked by a stranger over the phone.\n\n\u201cIn online polling you guard against the problem of hidden voters, who don\u2019t want to admit to a stranger who they are voting for,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dabi, the director general of Ifop, one of the country\u2019s leading polling companies.\n\nGetting the polls right initially appeared daunting for many pollsters. In the 16 weeks leading up to the first-round vote, assessing the prospects of a fragmented field of 11 candidates, including Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, a leftist, and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a center-right candidate hit by scandals, appeared so fraught that the newspaper Le Parisien, which regularly runs polls, decided not to run any.\n\nAdding to the challenges for pollsters, Mr. Macron was running without a political party and some doubted that his new movement could mobilize voters. Mr. Fillon, initially the front-runner, became mired in a corruption scandal. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon surged after a televised debate. Then, less than 36 hours before the polls opened, a gunman killed a police officer on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, potentially influencing the election.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe were worried before the election because this was not a traditional election between left and right, and there was a large element of unpredictability,\u201d said Bruno Jeanbart, the deputy managing director of OpinionWay, a leading Paris-based polling company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the results largely mirrored the polls. On April 21, the last day forecasts were published ahead of the vote, an average of eight major polls assembled by OpinionWay put Mr. Macron at 24 percent, Ms. Le Pen at 22.4 percent, Mr. Fillon at 19.4 percent and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon at 18.9 percent. The final results: 24 percent for Mr. Macron; 21.3 percent for Ms. Le Pen; 20 percent for Mr. Fillon; and 19.6 percent for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon.\n\nLooking to the second round, the candidates are offering diametrically opposed visions of France. While Mr. Macron, a former banker, favors economic liberalism and more European integration, Ms. Le Pen rails against immigrants, globalization and the European Union.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Jeanbart said he was confident about that forecast because fewer than a tenth of voters aged 65 or older, who tend to support the European Union, had voted for the Ms. Le Pen in the first round, and they constitute a quarter of registered voters. He also said it was easier to predict the performance of two candidates compared with 11.\n\nBut voters around the world are learning to be wary of certainties, and some analysts see a path to victory for Ms. Le Pen if her motivated supporters turn out in force and enough of Mr. Macron\u2019s supporters stay home.\n\nMr. Dabi of Ifop warned against those professing to have political crystal balls. \u201cIt is idiotic to say that Macron will win when the campaign is still on,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are not clairvoyants who can predict the future.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cIf the voters pollsters talk to turn out in force, there is less risk of getting it wrong,\u201d said Prof. Leighton Vaughan Williams, director of the Political Forecasting Unit at Nottingham Business School.While the practice has its critics, some pollsters say people are more likely to acknowledge that they are voting for a far-right party like the National Front if they are doing so by clicking a box on a website rather than if they are being asked by a stranger over the phone.Adding to the challenges for pollsters, Mr. Macron was running without a political party and some doubted that his new movement could mobilize voters.On April 21, the last day forecasts were published ahead of the vote, an average of eight major polls assembled by OpinionWay put Mr. Macron at 24 percent, Ms.Mr. Jeanbart said he was confident about that forecast because fewer than a tenth of voters aged 65 or older, who tend to support the European Union, had voted for the Ms."}
