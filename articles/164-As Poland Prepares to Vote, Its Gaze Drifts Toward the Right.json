{"title": "As Poland Prepares to Vote, Its Gaze Drifts Toward the Right", "authors": ["Rick Lyman"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/world/europe/poland-election-law-and-justice.html", "body": "Mr. Szacka leaned forward sadly, scanning one of several dozen platters of pastries local party officials had provided.\n\n\u201cIf the government finally changes, everything else also should change for the better,\u201d he said, hopefully.\n\nEvery pre-election poll has shown the Law and Justice party well ahead of the governing Civic Platform party, whose candidate for prime minister is the incumbent, Ewa Kopacz, though perhaps not far enough ahead to win a parliamentary majority on its own. As a result, it may need to form a coalition with one or more of the smaller parties.\n\nLaw and Justice has campaigned on a \u201cPoland first\u201d message, arguing that the country has become too beholden to the European Union and promising to build a more robust regional alliance with neighbors like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to be part of the European Union,\u201d Ms. Szydlo said. \u201cWe just want to be treated as equals.\u201d\n\nBut there are doubts about how far the new government would go in defying Brussels.\n\n\u201cI would definitely predict that the new government will have closer relations to the United States, as there are quite a few very pro-American politicians within Law and Justice,\u201d said Sergiusz Trzeciak, a political marketing specialist at Collegium Civitas in Warsaw and an independent political consultant. \u201cAt the same time, I expect it to try to maintain good relations with the E.U. in the end. I think it will be more a question of rhetoric than changing policy.\u201d\n\nOne issue likely to be given a higher profile by a Law and Justice government \u2014 given the party\u2019s aggressive attitude toward Russia, which is even more strident than that of the current governing party \u2014 is the presence of more American troops and armaments in Poland.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt will be a very, very important topic,\u201d said Bartlomiej Biskup, a political scientist at the Institute of Political Sciences in Warsaw. \u201cThe new government will insist on the presence of more U.S. troops, and for the building of a defensive missile shield. I would definitely say that their election would make it much more likely there are more American soldiers in Poland five years from now.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, political opponents continue to warn in the prelude to Sunday\u2019s voting that Law and Justice would be inclined to follow the example of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and build a more authoritarian state that mixes nationalist language with socialistic economic policies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The party\u2019s current leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is the former president\u2019s twin and is a former prime minister. The two brothers were socially conservative and had strong ties to Poland\u2019s powerful Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cWe certainly expect that the influence of the Catholic Church will become larger,\u201d said Barbara Nowacka, leader of the Left Alliance, a coalition of small left-wing parties that is scrambling to win enough votes to qualify for seats in the new Parliament. \u201cAnd Law and Justice has already said it is willing to change the Constitution, if it can get enough votes, to increase the powers of the president and take away crucial mechanisms from Parliament.\u201d\n\nIf Law and Justice does win the most seats on Sunday, it would reinforce the results of voting in May for the largely ceremonial post of president. In that election, Andrzej Duda of Law and Justice stunned the incumbent, Bronislaw Komorowski of Civic Platform.\n\nAt the time, the result was seen as a sign of widespread disaffection among Polish voters for traditional parties and the entire political class, largely because of the surprisingly strong third-place showing by a new party headed by the rock singer Pawel Kukiz, whose populist coalition drew angry retirees as well as young graduates in search of jobs.\n\nIn this round of voting, for the much more powerful posts in Parliament, Mr. Kukiz\u2019s coalition appears to have less support, but Mr. Petru\u2019s new party has found success with a message that includes upending the power of the country\u2019s traditional political classes.\n\nA month ago, when the European Union voted to require most member nations, including Poland, to accept some of the refugees who had been flooding into Europe, the crisis appeared set to dominate the parliamentary elections. Instead, as the election campaign enters its final days, the focus has moved to the more bread-and-butter issues that usually dominate Polish voting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLaw and Justice has promised to raise the minimum wage, lower the retirement age and cut some taxes, prompting opponents to charge that such measures would hurt Poland\u2019s public finances.\n\n\u201cBasically, the business community has some reservations about Law and Justice based on their populist policies,\u201d said Witold Orlowski, director of the Warsaw University of Technology Business School. \u201cWe are not talking about the Greek story, obviously, not something to make the country go bankrupt, but perhaps an increase in the deficit of, say, 2 percent of G.D.P.\u201d\n\nWhat Law and Justice will need to do to gain the trust of the business community, he added, is to convince them that the party will keep its campaign promises but that it is not, at heart, anti-business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 55-years-old, and I\u2019ve lost my job and can\u2019t find another one,\u201d a weeping woman told Ms. Szydlo at the Amor Wedding House. \u201cWhat can you offer me?\u201d\n\nMs. Szydlo did not address the woman\u2019s specific concerns, but she instead used the opportunity to take a swipe at the governing party.\n\n\u201cThose in power keep telling us that unemployment has been dropping,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what? People in small towns don\u2019t have jobs. People over 50 can\u2019t find work. We are not going to feed our children with statistics.\u201d", "summary": "Law and Justice has campaigned on a \u201cPoland first\u201d message, arguing that the country has become too beholden to the European Union and promising to build a more robust regional alliance with neighbors like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia.
