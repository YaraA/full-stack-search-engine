Soldiers with automatic weapons patrolled shopping malls. Several big stores stayed closed.\n\nNo incidents had been reported by the end of Saturday. The high alert was to continue through Sunday.\n\nThe security measures highlighted fears that Salah Abdeslam, a suspected Paris attacker and Molenbeek resident who is still at large, could be preparing a repeat of the Paris slaughter in Belgium.\n\nA senior European counterterrorism official said on Saturday that Mr. Abdeslam was believed to be heavily armed with weapons and explosives, and might be seeking to regroup with confederates in Belgium.\n\n\u201cHe may be on his last mission,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments. \u201cHe\u2019s up for a hell of an attack.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose fears were heightened Saturday after the lawyer for a man who traveled by car with Mr. Abdeslam to Brussels after the Paris attacks suggested that he may have been carrying a bomb.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe lawyer, Carine Couquelet, said her client, Hamza Attouh, told the police that Mr. Abdeslam \u201cseemed to be in a very bad state, very nervous, very anxious.\u201d Mr. Attouh said they did not discuss the attacks, according to the lawyer. But he said he told the police that Mr. Abdeslam was wearing a big jacket \u201cwith something underneath.\u201d While he did not know what it was, the lawyer said, the sight of it \u201cmade him scared.\u201d\n\nMr. Abdeslam, whose brother died in Paris when he detonated a suicide vest, was stopped by French police officers on Nov. 14 during a routine traffic check as he drove with two friends back to Brussels a few hours after the Paris attacks. But he was allowed to keep going and has since vanished. His two friends have both been arrested.\n\nMr. Abdeslam is now the target of an intensive manhunt and he has managed to avoid arrest.\n\nA police hotline for information about his whereabouts has received hundreds of calls but none have provided the authorities with enough information to establish his whereabouts. The Belgian news media has speculated that he may be dead.\n\nThe Abdeslam brothers both lived in Molenbeek, where they got to know Abdelhamid Abaaoud, an Islamic State militant who is believed to have been the chief planner of the Paris attacks and who died in a police raid just north of the French capital on Wednesday.\n\nThe Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office said on Saturday that the search of the Molenbeek residence of an unnamed man arrested on Thursday in another Brussels district had uncovered weapons, but no explosives. The arrested person has been charged with \u201cparticipation in terrorist attacks and participation in the activities of a terrorist organization,\u201d a federal magistrate, Eric Van der Sijpt, said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Sijpt declined to name the person, but several Belgian newspapers described him as a 39-year-old Moroccan, and said he gave help to Salah Abdeslam after the Paris attacks and has a brother who is fighting in Syria.\n\nMore than 500 Belgians have left to fight for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, making Belgium the biggest per capita contributor of foreign fighters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Dahmani, the Belgian national arrested in Turkey on his way to Syria, is suspected of having been \u201cin contact with the terrorists who perpetrated the Paris attacks,\u201d said a Turkish official who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with government protocol.\n\nHe arrived in Turkey from Amsterdam on Nov. 14 \u2014 the day after the Paris attacks. \u201cThere is no record of the Belgian authorities having warned Turkey about Dahmani \u2014 which is why there was no entry ban,\u201d the official said, adding, \u201cHad the Belgian authorities alerted us in due time, Dahmani could have been apprehended at the airport.\u201d\n\nThe storming on Friday of a hotel in Bamako, Mali, added to the anxieties in Belgium. Six Belgians were held hostage in the hotel, of whom four were released and two were killed, Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said on Saturday.", "summary": "A senior European counterterrorism official said on Saturday that Mr. Abdeslam was believed to be heavily armed with weapons and explosives, and might be seeking to regroup with confederates in Belgium.
