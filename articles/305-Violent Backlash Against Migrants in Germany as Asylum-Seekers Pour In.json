{"title": "Violent Backlash Against Migrants in Germany as Asylum-Seekers Pour In", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/world/europe/germany-migrants-attacks-asylum-seekers-backlash.html", "body": "Some of the episodes, such as the arson attacks in the Bavarian town of Vorra and in the eastern town of Tr\u00f6glitz, have received widespread attention. But there have been many others, including one in Lunzenau in Saxony on July 29, when vandals broke into and deliberately flooded an empty shelter for 50 asylum-seekers by opening the taps in the bathrooms.\n\nVideo\n\nThat same night, in nearby Dresden, a group of 50 people staged a demonstration against a tent city, hastily set up by the state to temporarily shelter hundreds of asylum-seekers. The Courage Against the Right group has counted 89 such demonstrations this year, many organized by local groups with names like Freital Defends Itself that have sprung up in cities and towns where empty office buildings and hotels have been converted into hostels for new arrivals.\n\nGermany has also witnessed record numbers of people volunteering their time, clothing and money to help the newcomers, and the German government, both nationally and on the state level, has strongly denounced the attacks.\n\nStill, the persistence of such attacks has human rights groups and security officials worried about the wider implications.\n\nGauri van Gulik, who monitors Europe for Amnesty International in London, said the group had seen a general increase in hate crimes directed against migrants in other European countries, but neither it nor any other group was able to provide solid statistics, in part because the laws vary by country. Germany, for example, has no laws against hate crimes, but counts rightist attacks as politically motivated crimes.\n\n\u201cIn Germany, the language has been so classic neo-Nazi we immediately identify it with the types of crimes associated with the far-right,\u201d Ms. van Gulik said.\n\nElsewhere, the rhetoric has been no more welcoming, and often the official policies are designed to push migrants away. Right-wing parties in Denmark are seeking to clamp down on the number of people coming in, while Hungary is pushing ahead with plans to build a 13-foot-high barbed-wire fence along its border with Serbia, despite criticism from its European Union partners.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Czech government has defended the right of the police to detain illegal migrants. Last week, its president, Milos Zeman, responded to a revolt among migrants held in a guarded facility by saying, \u201cNo one invited you here,\u201d and, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, leave.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut since a group called Pegida, the German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, grew from a cluster of friends into a movement, with organized demonstrations that attracted thousands to weekly marches through Dresden, German security officials have seen more attempts by neo-Nazis to use unease over the migrants to further incite hatred.\n\nMany in this country recall the racist attacks on facilities for asylum-seekers in parts of the former East Germany in the early 1990s, amid high joblessness and a breakdown of social services after that country\u2019s collapse.\n\nPresident Joachim Gauck, a former pastor and activist from East Germany, last month condemned the attacks on refugee housing as \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cintolerable.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Since then the situation has calmed, but red-and-white police tape still flutters across the street from the hostel, which houses people from Albania, Morocco and Syria.\n\nAbdel Wahir, 16, has been in Germany only three weeks. During that time, he has witnessed the country at both its best and its ugliest. His sister-in-law has received first-class medical care for an unspecified throat problem he said she developed on the trip here from Afghanistan. But he also witnessed angry protesters shouting racial slurs on the street outside the Leonardo, a former three-star hotel.\n\nA leading television journalist, Anja Reschke, delivered a commentary on the public television network ARD denouncing Internet commentators who she said were helping to incite fear with hate-filled remarks. In the video, which went viral in Germany, Ms. Reschke encouraged Germans who are \u201cnot of the opinion that all refugees are freeloaders that should be hunted, burned or gassed\u201d to make their opinion \u201cvery clearly known.\u201d\n\nFor those like Abdel Wahir, who walked for months and paid smugglers to help him on his journey through Europe, even the angry demonstrations are not enough to encourage him to turn back or seek refuge elsewhere. He said he had not yet had time to learn German, but planned to begin once his application for asylum was accepted, so that he could go on to study and get a job. \u201cGermany still good,\u201d he said in halting English, a broad smile on his face.", "summary": "That same night, in nearby Dresden, a group of 50 people staged a demonstration against a tent city, hastily set up by the state to temporarily shelter hundreds of asylum-seekers.
