{"title": "Luck Runs Out for a Leader of \u2018Brexit\u2019 Campaign", "authors": ["Sarah Lyall"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/world/europe/boris-johnson-brexit-conservatives.html", "body": "In the end, he was done in as much by his own hubris, lack of preparation and bewilderment in the face of the Brexit result as he was by the treachery and dwindling support of his colleagues. As he abandoned his campaign to be the Conservative Party leader \u2014 and with it, probably, his chances of ever being prime minister \u2014 he seemed almost relieved to be spared the burden of running the country he had done so much to destabilize.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Johnson, the former mayor of London, who has not given an interview since the Brexit vote, did not respond to a message left on his parliamentary office voice mail.\n\nFor a student of Shakespeare, which Mr. Johnson is (he is writing a biography) the situation was replete with ironies. A man who had spent his life behaving like Falstaff and making merry in the pub had failed to convince his party, and perhaps himself, that he had somehow suddenly turned into Prince Hal, poised to lead the country through its crisis in Europe.\n\nOn Thursday, the anger at Mr. Johnson was palpable, replacing last week\u2019s anger at Prime Minister David Cameron for calling the referendum in the first place. The sense that Mr. Johnson had presided over the Brexit campaign without a plan for what to do if it won \u2014 and then walked away without cleaning up his mess \u2014 was particularly enraging.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a general who marches his army to the sound of guns and the moment he sees the battleground abandons it,\u201d Michael Heseltine, a Tory politician, told the BBC. \u201cI have never seen anything like it. He ripped the Tory party apart. He has created the greatest constitutional crisis in peacetime in my life.\u201d\n\nJust a few days earlier, Mr. Johnson had seemed poised to coast into position as prime minister when Mr. Cameron stepped down in the fall. Outside London, at least before the referendum, he was the Conservative Party\u2019s star candidate, a populist maverick for the times. With his air of disarrayed befuddlement, his crazy coiffure, his idiosyncratically imaginative P.G. Wodehousian locution, his habit of slipping into Latin and Greek, his foot-in-the-mouth self-deprecation and his obvious delight in himself, he oozes a charm rarely seen in politicians.\n\nHe cycles to work and carries his things in a backpack. He looks as if he\u2019s slept in his clothes and just gotten out of bed. He has the privileged demeanor of an old Etonian (he went to school there), but a Bill Clintonesque way with crowds and an appeal that transcends class. In headlines he is \u201cBoJo\u201d; to most Britons he is simply \u201cBoris.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut his surface success has always carried alongside it a reputation for lies, evasions and exaggerations, a lack of seriousness and discipline, a tendency to wade blindly into situations without thinking through their ramifications, and a perception that he puts his own ambitions first. He has a habit of deflecting tough questions and affecting an amused insouciance about his mistakes, which include fathering a child with a woman other than his wife (he and his wife, a lawyer, have four children).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe is better on the big picture than he is on the details.\n\nTake last Monday\u2019s column by Mr. Johnson in The Daily Telegraph, the first substantive statement anyone from the Brexit side had made since the vote. As chaos swirled outside and Britain waited nervously for a sign that someone had a plan, Mr. Johnson produced a shoddily prepared article that seemed uncertain of its facts and backtracked on a number of key Brexit promises.\n\nSupporters of Mr. Johnson said at the time that the article had been written hastily and turned in late and should be treated more as a first draft than as a definitive statement.\n\nIn fact, it was as a journalist who played around with the facts that Mr. Johnson first made his name. He was fired from his first reporting job, at The Times of London, for inventing a quote and attributing it to an Oxford professor (who happened to be his godfather). But he was hired anyway by The Daily Telegraph and sent to Brussels in 1989 to cover the European Union.\n\nIt was a boring assignment, but Mr. Johnson found a way of livening it: He made things up. His great talent was to take tiny grains of information in reports and proposals, repackage them as official European policy and present them as part of a broad narrative about Brussels\u2019s risibility. His stories were full of wrong-sized condoms, fishermen forced to wear hairnets and international disputes over cheese policy.\n\nWhile his stories became increasingly influential in the euroskeptic wing of the Conservative Party and in many ways set the tone for the British papers\u2019 coverage of Europe ever since, Mr. Johnson tends to treat his approach as great fun.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI was just chucking these rocks over the garden wall and listening to this amazing crash from the greenhouse next door over in England,\u201d he told an interviewer.\n\n\u201cEverything I wrote from Brussels was having this amazing explosive effect on the Tory party,\u201d he said, \u201cand it really gave me this, I suppose, rather weird sense of power.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter Brussels, Mr. Johnson became editor of The Spectator, which functions as a kind of house organ for conventional Conservative Party wisdom, and began writing a popular weekly column in The Daily Telegraph. In 2001 he won a seat in Parliament.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

He boasted to me in the humble-brag way peculiar to British upper-class men that, trying to juggle three jobs, he was unable to do any of them properly. \u201cBecause I have no time to do it, I do it in no time,\u201d he said of his Telegraph column. \u201cYou just whack it out.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson seemed constitutionally incapable of taking anything truly seriously. Deciding he did not feel like being photographed for The Times article, for instance, he got another man in The Spectator office to impersonate him in the photo session. The photographer duly snapped away, until the magazine\u2019s publisher found out what was going on and made Mr. Johnson sit for the portrait. (He was 37 at the time.)\n\nAround that time Mr. Johnson also became a bona fide celebrity, honing his trademark persona as a hyperarticulate upper-class-twit-for-the-masses in a string of highly amusing appearances on the current events quiz show \u201cHave I Got News For You.\u201d Viewers adored him.\n\n\u201cHis charming, bumbling buffoon image was neatly done and went down very well with audiences,\u201d said Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye magazine and a panelist on the show.\n\nIn 2008, Mr. Johnson unexpectedly ran for mayor of London and, even more unexpectedly for a Conservative in a Labour city, won. The same complaints that had dogged him in the past dogged him again, along with criticisms that he had failed to address serious issues like air quality and affordable housing.\n\n\u201cWe had eight frustrating years where we\u2019d ask detailed policy questions, and what we\u2019d get back in response was bluster and grandiose claims,\u201d said Joanne McCartney, a Labour Assembly member who is now deputy mayor. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t know the answer to the question, which was a regular occurrence, he\u2019d use bluster and wit to avoid answering.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson all along denied that he wanted to be prime minister, saying it was about as likely as his being \u201creincarnated as an olive.\u201d But he has always been wittier, quicker and more charismatic than Mr. Cameron. The 2012 London Olympics proved the perfect showcase for his off-the-cuff anarchic wit. Filmed stranded haplessly on a malfunctioning zipwire, Mr. Johnson took an incident that would have humiliated most other politicians and somehow used it to burnish his appeal. (A photograph of the dangling Mr. Johnson was used to quite different effect last week on the cover of the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration.)\n\nMr. Cameron has always been threatened by Mr. Johnson; his efforts to slough off the mayor as a kind of amusing Tory mascot never worked. But it wasn\u2019t until Mr. Johnson betrayed the prime minister by throwing his support behind the Brexit campaign that the party saw the extent of his ambition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore now, Mr. Johnson has rarely been confronted by a situation he could not maneuver his way through. But a harbinger came in March, when he was summoned before a House of Commons committee and forensically interrogated by its Javert-like Tory chairman, Andrew Tyrie, about a series of statements he had made over the years about Europe.\n\nMr. Johnson tried his normal humorous approach. Asked, for instance, about his assertion that the European Union has a law saying that balloons cannot be blown up by children under 8 (it doesn\u2019t), he deflected the question, saying, \u201cIn my household, only children under 8 are allowed to blow up balloons.\u201d\n\nHe continued in this vein throughout the session, as Mr. Tyrie peered unsmilingly at him, acid in his voice.\n\n\u201cThis is all very interesting, Boris,\u201d Mr. Tyrie said at one point. \u201cExcept none of it is really true, is it?\u201d", "summary": "A man who had spent his life behaving like Falstaff and making merry in the pub had failed to convince his party, and perhaps himself, that he had somehow suddenly turned into Prince Hal, poised to lead the country through its crisis in Europe.
