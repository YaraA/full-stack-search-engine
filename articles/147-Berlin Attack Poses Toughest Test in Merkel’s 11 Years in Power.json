{"title": "Berlin Attack Poses Toughest Test in Merkel\u2019s 11 Years in Power", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/world/europe/berlin-attack-angela-merkel.html", "body": "After Donald J. Trump won the election in the United States, she noted: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen in America, and what, for instance, Trump might do with Russia and China. Europe is not even taken into consideration, and that is really worrying.\u201d\n\nFor now, Ms. Merkel\u2019s main worry is at home, where the newspaper Bild tried to catch the national mood on Wednesday with a huge headline: \u201cAngst!\u201d or \u201cFear!\u201d\n\nInside, the commentator Nikolaus Blome analyzed in greater depth, writing that it was up to politicians and especially Ms. Merkel to get a grip on terrorism. \u201cThat will be tough: She cannot count on the trust and confidence she long enjoyed but which is now not as certain as it was even two years ago,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe is certainly not the only one to blame. But many people in the country project their anger, their fear, on Angela Merkel, on her personally. So it will become her toughest test. And the end is wide open.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel has openly mused about her reluctance to run for a fourth term. But a sense of obligation \u2014 not just to her party and to her country, but also to Europe as populist forces gain pace \u2014 seemed to outweigh the obvious: Almost any democratic leader would be vulnerable to a desire for change after three terms in power.\n\nIf she wins a fourth four-year term, Ms. Merkel will rival her political patron, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, for longevity in office.\n\nShe, more than anyone, is aware of the odds. At a party congress where delegates signaled their unhappiness with her decision to admit roughly a million migrants, many of them Muslim, she demanded support: \u201cYou must, you must help me.\u201d\n\nEarlier, after her party lost two state elections in September, she even said she wished she could turn the clock back many years and revisit many aspects of immigration policy and security on Europe\u2019s external borders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat all reflected the danger she feels from the right-wing Alternative for Germany, which was established in 2013 as an anti-euro party but which swiftly pivoted in 2015 to an anti-migrant platform that has now propelled it into 10 of Germany\u2019s 16 state legislatures.\n\nAlternative for Germany has steadily eaten into the market share of Ms. Merkel\u2019s mainstream, conservative Christian Democratic Union. This week, Alternative for Germany\u2019s leaders wasted no time in blaming Ms. Merkel and her policies for the Berlin attack.\n\nMore ominously for the chancellor, Horst Seehofer, the leader of the Bavarian sister party to her Christian Democrats, demanded a complete overhaul of immigration and security policy.\n\nMs. Merkel, who still needs Mr. Seehofer\u2019s party to back her run next year, has not responded, allowing others to criticize the Bavarian leader for seeking to make hay out of a terrorist attack.\n\nNonetheless, her cabinet on Wednesday swiftly passed an array of measures, first announced in August, to bolster domestic security, including extensive video surveillance of a kind common in Europe but rare in Germany, where memories of Nazi and Communist tactics mean citizens jealously guard their right to privacy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

With this attack, she now has a new task to tackle. That is how she thinks.\u201d\n\nUlrich Speck, a German analyst in Brussels for a Madrid-based think tank, Real Instituto Elcano, also argued that Ms. Merkel would simply deal with the new situation in an increasingly unpredictable world.\n\nHe cited her statement after Mr. Trump\u2019s election in which she laid down conditions \u2014 including respect for everyone \u2014 for cooperating with the new president.\n\nDomestically, Mr. Speck said, Ms. Merkel can draw on the continuing support for helping migrants. But, he noted, the attack on Monday had opened her to mounting criticism and lent her a rare impression of fragility.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe feeling that someone is there who is managing it for us has gone,\u201d Mr. Speck said, echoing Mr. Blome\u2019s assessment of the chancellor\u2019s rapport with voters.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking more closely, and there is a very vocal minority where there is really an anti-Merkel mood,\u201d Mr. Speck said. But, he added, \u201cI think she has the compass to sense where the middle is.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jackson Janes, an American expert on Germany with a Washington-based think tank, the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, predicted that \u201cshe is going to have a real tough year.\u201d Uncertainty abroad \u2014 in Europe and beyond \u2014 will help scramble German politics, too, he said.\n\nThat might mean that more parties clear the 5 percent hurdle to get into Parliament in next year\u2019s elections, making it harder to form a viable coalition under Ms. Merkel, even if she and her party finish first.\n\nDaniela Schwarzer of the German Council on Foreign Relations, a Berlin-based think tank, agreed that \u201cthis is clearly a very difficult time,\u201d amplified by the danger of terrorist attacks that have increased in frequency in Germany this year.\n\n\u201cMerkel, or anyone else, will only be able to maintain the level of support moderate politicians used to have if they demonstrate some kind of vision about where things are going,\u201d she said.\n\nOtherwise, she added, support could veer toward \u201cothers who have a vision \u2014 anti-migration, anti-liberal, anti-whatever.\u201d\n\nAnother danger is the prospect of Russian interference with Germany\u2019s elections, as noted by the head of the country\u2019s foreign intelligence service, Bruno Kahl, and by Ms. Merkel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt is known that cyberattacks take place that have no other purpose than to provoke political uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Kahl told the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cA kind of pressure is being exercised on public discourse and democracy here, which is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel, in separate remarks about a hacking that left 900,000 Germans without telephone and internet service recently, said that \u201csuch cyberattacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life, and we must learn to cope with them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to informing citizens, she said: \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be unsettled by this. We must simply know that this exists, and learn to live with it.\u201d"}
