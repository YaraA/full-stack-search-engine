Among the indicted politicians who are campaigning around the region, five are incumbent mayors from Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party, but there are also Socialists and representatives of smaller parties.\n\nThis month, the European Commission fined Spain for misreporting its deficit data, not because of the central government\u2019s failures, but because Valencia had \u201csystematically sent incorrect information to the national statistical authorities over many years\u201d about its health care spending, it said. The action was the first of its kind against a European Union member.\n\nA week earlier, Mr. Fabra suspended one of the most senior members of his party, Alfonso Rus, after the radio station Cadena Ser broadcast a recorded conversation in which Mr. Rus is said to be heard counting bribe money he had received.\n\nMr. Rus had campaigned against forcing indicted politicians to resign from office, arguing that the judiciary should first be allowed to issue rulings.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Sunday, he is hoping to be re-elected as mayor of X\u00e0tiva, even without the official support of the Popular Party.\n\nSimilarly, some of the indicted politicians say they have refused to resign or opt out of Sunday\u2019s vote because they should be considered innocent until proved guilty.\n\nThey also say that they cannot control the pace of Spain\u2019s notoriously slow judiciary, now overloaded with corruption investigations. Mr. Fabra himself took over as Valencia\u2019s regional president from Francisco Camps, who was forced to resign in 2011 because of bribery charges. Mr. Camps, however, was acquitted six months later.\n\n\u201cI believe President Fabra has done a wonderful job in terms of cleaning up the party of anybody that was really involved in corruption,\u201d said Javier P\u00e9rez, the conservative mayor of Callosa de Segura, a town of 18,000.\n\nMr. P\u00e9rez, however, is himself hoping to win a fourth term as mayor Sunday, even though he is indicted on a charge of using his political power to get preferential utility contracts for some of his housing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. P\u00e9rez, who is also a construction entrepreneur, denies any wrongdoing, saying the court case \u201chas been kept open on purpose until the elections, to see if my opponents could use it to hurt my candidacy.\u201d\n\nAsked how Mr. Fabra\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d had been applied, Mr. Fabra\u2019s office responded in an email that it had been used to push out any official \u201cif there are proofs of shameful behavior.\u201d\n\nIn Benic\u00e0ssim, another town in Valencia, the mayor, Susana Marqu\u00e9s, has been indicted alongside other Town Hall officials for wiping off the debt of a collapsed tourism company \u2014 using only public money \u2014 even though the company also had hoteliers and other private investors in its shareholding.\n\nMs. Marqu\u00e9s has denied wrongdoing, and she refused an interview request.\n\nThe Socialists have also allowed some of their tainted politicians to campaign, including in Valencia, where Jos\u00e9 Benlloch is seeking re-election as mayor of Vila-real.\n\nIn March, a judge called for Mr. Benlloch to be indicted as part of an investigation into the award of public contracts. Mr. Benlloch also denies wrongdoing, claiming that he is the victim of political persecution.\n\nBeyond Valencia, Sunday\u2019s vote is expected to reflect the steady fragmentation and polarization of Spanish politics since Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party won a resounding victory in the last municipal elections in 2011, followed six months later by general elections that gave his party a parliamentary majority.\n\nThis time, the Popular Party is expected to keep an outright majority in just one region, Castile and Le\u00f3n, according to a survey published this month by the Center for Sociological Research, known as CIS.\n\nThat could leave parties in most other regions forced to form coalition governments.\n\nThe biggest upheavals may be found in Spain\u2019s two largest cities, Madrid and Barcelona, where upstart politicians are neck and neck with established candidates, according to recent polls.\n\nStill, analysts warn, even if upstarts win in those cities, their challenge will be keeping a clean slate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe question,\u201d said Mr. Barroso from Teneo Intelligence, \u201cwill become whether problematic politicians also start to show up in these new parties.\u201d"}
