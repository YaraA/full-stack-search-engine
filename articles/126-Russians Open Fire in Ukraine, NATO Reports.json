Poroshenko of Ukraine and his Russian counterpart, Mr. Putin, in Minsk, Belarus.\n\nMs. Merkel spoke by telephone with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on Friday and \u201cexpressed her great concern\u201d over Russia\u2019s unilateral decision to move its aid trucks into Ukraine, her spokesman said. She also spoke with President Obama and, according to the White House, both leaders agreed that the arrival of the convoy represented \u201ca violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d\n\nIn a news briefing, the Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. John Kirby, condemned the convoy as an \u201cunauthorized entry into Ukraine\u201d and called for the vehicles\u2019 immediate withdrawal. The move into Ukraine, without the Red Cross escorts that had been agreed upon, drew angry accusations from Ukraine that Moscow had broken its word and mounted what Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Security Service, called a \u201cdirect invasion.\u201d\n\nBut Ukraine stepped back from earlier threats to use \u201call forces available\u201d to halt any Russian vehicles that crossed the frontier without its full accord, and Mr. Poroshenko told the visiting foreign minister of Lithuania, \u201cWe will do our best to ensure that this does not lead to more serious consequences.\u201d\n\nThe comments by Mr. Poroshenko suggested that Ukraine would limit its response to verbal protests and not use force against the Russian vehicles, although it was unclear whether volunteer Ukrainian battalions of sometimes shaky discipline would respect calls for restraint.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a long statement saying in essence that it had authorized the crossing because it was fed up with stalling by the government in Kiev. Russian news agencies quoted a spokesman for Mr. Putin as saying that he had been informed of the convoy\u2019s movements.\n\n\u201cAll the excuses to delay the delivery of aid to people in the area of a humanitarian catastrophe are exhausted,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cThe Russian side has made a decision to act. Our column with humanitarian cargo starts moving toward Luhansk.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThat brought a curt response from a spokeswoman from the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remember that Russia is purporting to alleviate a humanitarian situation which Russia itself created,\u201d Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement. \u201cIf Russia really wants to ease the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, it could do so today by halting its supply of weapons, equipment, and fighters to its proxies,\u201d she added.\n\nIn a telephone interview after a meeting with Mr. Poroshenko, the Lithuanian foreign minister, Linas A. Linkevicius, described the Russian move as \u201ca serious escalation\u201d but said Ukraine\u2019s president had made clear there would be \u201cno attack\u201d on the trucks by Ukrainian forces.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Ukrainian government has suggested it would be reluctant to attack with a convoy interposed.\n\nThe trucks are traveling toward Luhansk, a war-ravaged rebel-held city where the bullet-riddled body of the acting honorary consul for Lithuania, a 39-year-old Ukrainian national named Mykola Zelenets, was found on Thursday. He was kidnapped earlier this month by armed separatists, the Lithuanian ambassador to Ukraine, Petras Vaitiekunas, said.\n\nLuhansk has come under heavy military pressure in recent days from Ukrainian forces. The rebel city\u2019s recapture by Ukraine would deliver a humiliating blow to Mr. Putin, who has faced mounting calls from hard-line nationalists in Russia to intervene decisively to stave off defeat for the Russian-speaking and often ethnically Russian separatists.\n\nWhile denying that it supports the rebels, despite a steady flow of arms and fighters into eastern Ukraine from Russia, the Kremlin has tied itself to their fate by whipping up a nationalist fervor with vows to protect Russians beyond Russia\u2019s borders.\n\nThe decision to send in the aid trucks in defiance of Kiev suggested an attempt by Mr. Putin to calm nationalist complaints that he has not done enough to prevent a rebel defeat and marked the latest in a long series of surprise moves by the Russian president, a judo practitioner, to put Ukraine and the West off balance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpreading the conspicuously large white aid trucks through Luhansk could effectively impose a cease-fire, essentially daring the Ukrainians to fire at vehicles that have been sent to provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Any respite in Ukraine\u2019s military offensive could allow rebels to dig in further, and indefinitely postpone any attempt to oust them.\n\nUkraine has from the start viewed Russia\u2019s aid convoy, which left Moscow on Aug. 12, with deep suspicion, worrying that the vehicles could be carrying weapons or be part of a ruse by Moscow to support the pro-Russian separatists, or possibly an attempt to provoke Ukraine into an ill-advised attack.\n\n\u201cThis is a provocation,\u201d said Andriy Lysenko, Ukraine\u2019s military spokesman. \u201cThey expect us to attack the convoy.\u201d\n\nHe added that Ukrainian forces would allow the convoy to reach Luhansk, because \u201cit is easy to shoot but the consequences would be very destructive.\u201d He said Ukraine would adopt a different approach if it turned out that, after reaching Luhansk, the convoy \u201chas other equipment, not just humanitarian aid.\u201d\n\nUnder the arrangements agreed to by the two countries, officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross were to escort the trucks to Luhansk. They decided not to proceed after heavy shelling around the city during the night, Ewan Watson, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said in Geneva.\n\nThe main highway from the border crossing at Izvaryne to Luhansk has seen heavy fighting over the past week, as Ukrainian forces pressed their military campaign against the separatists. The rebel forces have been driven out of a string of towns and villages but are still holding out in Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nThere were no signs of Russian military vehicles or any other indications of an armed escort by Russian troops. The United States and its European allies have warned that any crossing of the border by Russian military vehicles, even under the pretext of protecting the aid convoy, would be regarded as an invasion.\n\nSeveral dozen trucks, from a convoy of about 270, crossed the border around noon. Soldiers carrying automatic rifles and wearing camouflage, some bearing the markings of the rebels in eastern Ukraine, cleared the road to let the convoy move past."}
