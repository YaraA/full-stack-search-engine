Putin.\n\nMany of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s supporters may have little fondness for Ms. Le Pen, but in interviews they expressed equal disdain for the pro-free market Mr. Macron. \u201cFor me, Le Pen, Macron, it\u2019s the same,\u201d said Olivia Scemama, a musician from the 18th Arrondissement of Paris who said she voted for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon. \u201cWith Macron, it\u2019s the extremism of banks, of finance.\u201d\n\nThe election results published Monday suggested another hurdle for Ms. Le Pen to overcome: a sharp urban-rural divide in the vote, with voters in France\u2019s major cities heavily favoring her rivals. The geography and sociology of her support was similar to Donald J. Trump\u2019s support in the 2016 United States presidential race. She won more d\u00e9partements \u2014 between a county and a state in French political geography \u2014 than Mr. Macron, and she won the working-class vote. But she did poorly in what French sociologists call \u201cWinner\u2019s France\u201d \u2014 urban, employed, well-educated and pro-European. She received less than 5 percent of the vote in Paris, less than 8 percent in Bordeaux and less than 9 percent in Lyon.\n\nStock markets opened higher on Monday across Europe, a sign that investors were relieved by Mr. Macron\u2019s strong showing. Ms. Le Pen wants France to leave the euro currency zone, a prospect that created unease on international markets in the prelude to the first round of voting.\n\nPolls released Monday showed that about 60 percent of voters supported Mr. Macron, compared with less than 40 percent for Ms. Le Pen. A live televised debate between the candidates is set for May 3.\n\nIn H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, the northern French city where Ms. Le Pen won 46 percent of the vote and whose National Front mayor is one of her top advisers, even supporters were pessimistic about her chances in the runoff. \u201cIt\u2019s a bummer,\u201d said Jean-Louis Devienne, 72. \u201cIf people could come here and see how good the National Front has been for our town, they would understand how good it can be for our country.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Ms. Le Pen continued to emphasize the anti-immigrant and anti-globalization views that propelled her into the second round, and she denounced the efforts of the mainstream parties to keep her out of the presidency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe old and completely rotten Republican Front, which no one wants, and which the French have pushed away with exceptional violence, is trying to coalesce around Mr. Macron,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said in Rouvroy, a town in the deindustrialized north of France where her message tends to resonate with voters.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Le Pen also called Mr. Macron \u201cweak\u201d on terrorism, an issue that drew renewed attention days before the first round of voting, when a gunman on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, in central Paris, killed a police officer.\n\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is scheduled to pay tribute to the fallen officer at a ceremony on Tuesday. His office said that Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen are expected to attend.\n\nMr. Macron, who has never held elective office, came in first among 11 candidates, with 24 percent of the vote. Ms. Le Pen was second, with 21.3 percent, according to final results tallied Monday by the Interior Ministry.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He was followed by Mr. M\u00e9lenchon at 19.6 percent, and the Socialist candidate, Beno\u00eet Hamon, at 6.4 percent.\n\nThe mainstream parties were left struggling to pick up the pieces after their poor showing. On the right, many were quick to blame their candidate, Mr. Fillon, who refused to drop out of the race after the embezzlement scandal.\n\nThe Socialists and the Republicans will now be looking to elections in June, when French voters will elect the members of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower and more powerful house of Parliament. Those legislative elections could present a bigger challenge for Mr. Macron than winning the second round of the presidential election. He has vowed to field candidates in all 577 districts. But his political movement is barely a year old, and he is up against the established parties, which are weakened but still have extensive networks.\n\nAlthough Mr. Macron is seen as an overwhelming favorite in the second round of the presidential election, he was warned not to take victory for granted and \u2014 after he spent Monday night with supporters at a chic restaurant in the wealthy Sixth Arrondissement of Paris \u2014 not to celebrate too much, too soon.", "summary": "Le Pen\u2019s advisers said, in interviews with French news media on Monday, that they were hoping to lure some of the supporters of the defeated Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, whose populist program bore similarities to that of Ms.Le Pen: hostility to the European Union, NATO and the forces of globalization, and a forgiving attitude toward Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V.
