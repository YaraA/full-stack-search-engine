Those who carry them out are young and old. Heightening the pervasive sense of dread, terrorism in Europe seems to have no one face, no one method, no one target and knows no national borders.\n\nMost of all in France, which has suffered the most attacks of any European country, they have become part of life. The deadliest attack in Europe this year was carried out by a lone driver in Nice on July 14. He used a cargo truck to career into crowds leaving the annual fireworks festivities, and killed 90 people. There have been at least nine other attacks or attempted attacks in the country.\n\nIn a much-criticized comment made after the Nice killings, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France said: \u201cTimes have changed, and we should learn to live with terrorism.

These open-air markets, which often dominate ancient, picturesque streets, coincide with the period of Advent, the four Sundays before Christmas, and have become a monthlong excuse for socializing, shopping and drinking hot spiced wine punch, and informal outdoor concerts.\n\nFamilies frequent the Christmas markets. So do people working downtown who dart out at lunch to get a little present at one place and a stocking-stuffer at another, and drink a cup of something.\n\nBut markets are dauntingly hard to protect \u2014 a determined killer can almost always find a way to enter and wreak mayhem.\n\nHence, the heavy security in Strasbourg.
