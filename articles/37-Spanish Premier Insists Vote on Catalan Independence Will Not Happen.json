But if a vote was to take place, it could well become an issue that draws in other European governments, some of whom face separatist movements of their own.\n\nIf Scots had voted to break away in a referendum approved by the British government, the European Union would have \u201csomehow adjusted, even if on some issues Brussels would have had to square a legal circle,\u201d Mr. Torreblanca said. If Catalonia holds a vote without the approval of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, however, \u201cit would be a real earthquake for the E.U., forcing other Europeans to enter uncharted waters and take sides in a national dispute that has no precedent.\u201d\n\nThe decree signed by Artur Mas, the Catalan leader, ratcheted up a dispute that began two years ago over fiscal issues into a secessionist challenge with political risks for both leaders. Spain holds a general election next year.\n\nMr. Rajoy accused Mr. Mas on Monday of irresponsibility in pushing Catalans toward a secession vote when, under Spain\u2019s Constitution, only a majority of Spaniards can alter Spain\u2019s \u201cindivisible sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody who can deprive all Spaniards of the right to decide over what is their country,\u201d Mr. Rajoy said at a news conference after an emergency cabinet meeting. \u201cWhoever has got underway this whole process is responsible for its serious consequences.\u201d\n\nA vote, Mr. Rajoy said, \u201cis against the law, steps beyond democracy, divides Catalans, moves them away from Europe and hurts their well-being.\u201d\n\nMr. Mas, however, said in a television interview on Sunday that it was Mr. Rajoy who was forcing a vote by refusing to make any fiscal or other concessions to Catalonia. \u201cThere is no plan B,\u201d Mr. Mas said in the interview with La Sexta, a Spanish TV channel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Mas has trumpeted Scotland\u2019s referendum as a \u201cgreat lesson in democracy\u201d that Mr. Rajoy should heed.\n\nFor Spain, the economic consequences of a secession would likely be greater than they would have been for Britain. Spain is still recovering economically from the euro debt crisis and continues to struggle with near-record unemployment, following a lengthy recession and a banking bailout.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Scotland\u2019s North Sea oil assets make it the wealthiest part of Britain per capita; this fed into secessionist arguments that Scotland\u2019s economy could thrive without support from London.\n\nCatalonia\u2019s 7.5 million people represent 16 percent of the Spanish population, but also account for a larger share of Spain\u2019s economy \u2014 19 percent. That has fueled resentment among Catalans about Spain\u2019s fiscal system, which redistributes their taxes to weaker Spanish regions.\n\nMr. Rajoy said on Monday that he was willing to resume \u201ca fruitful dialogue\u201d with Mr. Mas about some economic concessions, \u201cbut always within the return to legality.\u201d Mr. Rajoy refused to discuss how his government would respond if Catalonia set up ballot boxes on Nov. 9.\n\nThe Catalan regional government has budgeted 8.9 million euros \u2014 about $11.3 million \u2014 to finance the vote. A Catalan vote would also be a bellwether for other independence-minded regions, notably the Basque region, which has a long and violent history of separatism.\n\nMr. Mas, on the other hand, faces the difficult choice of going ahead with an illegal vote or of delaying the vote to allow for further negotiations with Mr. Rajoy, which could lead to protests in Catalonia. He could also call early elections in Catalonia \u2014 with the risk that more hard-line secessionist politicians could win and oust him and his Convergence party from power.\n\nMr. Mas insisted on Sunday that he acted within the law, signing a decree that was validated by Catalonia\u2019s own legal experts, as well as an overwhelming majority of regional lawmakers. Still, he noted that history also offered examples of civil disobedience leading to political and social progress.\n\nCatalonia \u201cisn\u2019t Kosovo,\u201d said Mr. Torreblanca, the political analyst, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to believe that at least a small fraction of Catalans will not get more radical, because the sense of frustration if there is no vote will be very real.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Sept. 11, hundreds of thousands of pro-independence Catalans marched in Barcelona on Catalonia\u2019s national day to demand a vote.\n\nCatalans have a strong cultural identity and have long clashed with Madrid. The botched proclamation of a Catalan state during the 1930s was eventually followed by the Spanish Civil War and the lengthy dictatorship of its winner, Francisco Franco.\n\nSpain\u2019s return to democracy in the late 1970s, however, allowed Catalonia and other regions to reclaim some autonomy \u2014 notably over an education system in which Catalan was promoted as the main language \u2014 in return for broad cooperation with successive governments in Madrid.\n\nUnder Jordi Pujol, who founded the Convergence party and led Catalonia from 1980 to 2003, Catalonia\u2019s government then \u201cfollowed a pragmatic approach of seeking concessions from Madrid, but not ones that could ever lead to a break-up,\u201d said Josep Fontana, a Catalan historian.\n\nEven with his political future in the balance, Mr. Mas will not proceed with a vote that would have \u201cno international credibility\u201d if held against a constitutional ruling, said Josep Ramoneda, a Catalan writer and political columnist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that is extremely difficult to unblock and that is likely to leave Catalonia stuck in muddy waters for a long time,\u201d Mr. Ramoneda said. \u201cSooner or later, there will be a referendum because even if the path chosen by Mas isn\u2019t the right one, you cannot just respond to such sovereignty demands with legal arguments.\u201d", "summary": "It is not clear what steps Mr. Rajoy would take should the Catalans press ahead with a vote in the face of a court ruling against them and opposition from the central government.If Scots had voted to break away in a referendum approved by the British government, the European Union would have \u201csomehow adjusted, even if on some issues Brussels would have had to square a legal circle,\u201d Mr. Torreblanca said.If Catalonia holds a vote without the approval of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, however, \u201cit would be a real earthquake for the E.U., forcing other Europeans to enter uncharted waters and take sides in a national dispute that has no precedent.\u201dMr. Mas insisted on Sunday that he acted within the law, signing a decree that was validated by Catalonia\u2019s own legal experts, as well as an overwhelming majority of regional lawmakers.Catalonia \u201cisn\u2019t Kosovo,\u201d said Mr. Torreblanca, the political analyst, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to believe that at least a small fraction of Catalans will not get more radical, because the sense of frustration if there is no vote will be very real.\u201d"}
