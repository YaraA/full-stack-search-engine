She is considered a candidate of continuity who is farther to the right than Prime Minister David Cameron, who announced his resignation the day after the vote for to leave the bloc.\n\nVideo\n\nOn Thursday, Ms. May ruled out a second referendum or any effort to rejoin the European Union, emphasizing that there must be better control of immigration.\n\n\u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe campaign was fought, the vote was held, turnout was high and the public gave their verdict,\u201d she said. \u201cThere must be no attempts to remain inside the E.U., no attempts to rejoin it through the back door and no second referendum.\u201d\n\nShe said that negotiations with Brussels would take years and that they would not start before the end of the year, despite impatience among European leaders. It is notable that the chairman of her campaign is a \u201cBrexit\u201d supporter, Chris Grayling, the leader of the House of Commons.\n\nWhile the bookmakers made Ms. May the new favorite to succeed Mr. Cameron, she is vulnerable to charges that in her years as home secretary, she failed to reduce net immigration to Britain.\n\nAlso seeking the office are Stephen Crabb, a young Welsh lawmaker who is the work and pensions secretary; Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister; and Liam Fox, a former defense secretary.\n\nThe turmoil in the Conservative Party is following a script, with friends betrayed and secret deals, that seems derived from \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d itself drawn from centuries of English history.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Johnson, in his own speech, included a reference to Brutus in \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d and spoke of \u201ca tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.\u201d It was not a time to \u201cfight against the tide of history, but to take that tide at the flood and sail on to fortune,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Johnson himself played Brutus to Prime Minister Cameron\u2019s Caesar. But he got to be Caesar for only a very short time before Mr. Gove took on the role of Brutus. Mr. Johnson, a betrayer betrayed, seemed more rueful than angry. And he was silent about which candidate he might now support.\n\nMr. Gove, who was a close friend of Mr. Cameron before backing the British exit, appears to have been encouraged to run by Cameron aides who vowed privately to try to block the ascension of Mr. Johnson, regarded as more interested in the game of politics than in the substance.\n\nIt has been evident in the days since the referendum that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove had had no agreed-upon plan for what to do if they won, and that they have disagreements about how to approach the future.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said his \u201cplan for the United Kingdom, which I hope can provide unity and change\u201d would be unveiled \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\nMs. May, the daughter of a vicar, portrayed herself as a candidate for ordinary voters. \u201cIf you\u2019re from an ordinary working-class family, life is just much harder than many people in politics realize,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a job, but you often don\u2019t have job security.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankly, not everybody in Westminster understands that,\u201d she said, referring to Parliament and the government.\n\nIf selected by the Conservatives, she would be the second woman to become Britain\u2019s prime minister, after Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThe five candidates will be winnowed down to two by successive votes by Conservative Party members of Parliament, beginning on July 5. One of those two will then be chosen as the next leader by the 150,000 or so registered members of the party, with an outcome to be announced on Sept. 9.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe opposition Labour Party, too, is in the midst of a leadership struggle. The incumbent, Jeremy Corbyn, overwhelmingly lost a no-confidence vote among Labour\u2019s members of Parliament, but he has said he will not resign. He faces an expected challenge by Angela Eagle, the former Labour spokeswoman for business.\n\nIf both Ms. May and Ms. Eagle emerge victorious, women would lead Britain and Scotland. Women would head both main British political parties as well as all three in Scotland and one in Wales.\n\nThere were auguries on Wednesday when an email to Mr. Gove from his wife, Sarah Vine, a journalist, was leaked. In it, she urged her husband to approach a commitment to Mr. Johnson with skepticism, and to lock down any commitments beforehand, especially on controls over immigration. She encouraged Mr. Gove to have \u201cleverage\u201d in his dealings with Mr. Johnson, claiming that without Mr. Gove\u2019s support, the Conservative Party membership will not have \u201cthe necessary reassurance to back Boris\u201d in the leadership vote.\n\nIn another Shakespearean reference, Ms.Vine has been lampooned on social media as a pushy, plotting Lady Macbeth.\n\nLess than two weeks ago, just days before the June 23 referendum, Mr. Gove was adamant that he did not have the desire or the talent to become prime minister. Praising Mr. Cameron \u201cas an exceptional person with exceptional talents,\u201d Mr. Gove told The Daily Telegraph, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have got that exceptional level of ability required for the job.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, Mr. Gove told the BBC, \u201cI could not be prime minister, I\u2019m not equipped to be prime minister, I don\u2019t want to be prime minister.\u201d\n\nBut all that was then.\n\nMark Field, a legislator who was planning to back Mr. Johnson, said, \u201cAt least it shows that it\u2019s not just the Labour Party that is capable of being a complete shambles.\u201d", "summary": "She is considered a candidate of continuity who is farther to the right than Prime Minister David Cameron, who announced his resignation the day after the vote for to leave the bloc.
