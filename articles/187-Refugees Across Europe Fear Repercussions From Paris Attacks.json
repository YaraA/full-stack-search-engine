In November, about 4,000 a day were landing on Greek islands from Turkey; the average in October was 10,000.\n\nVideo\n\nAcross Europe, governments, volunteers and aid workers still care for migrants on the move and for asylum seekers who have recently arrived.\n\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France on Wednesday repeated his commitment to take in 30,000 migrants from Syria and Iraq, though he said asylum seekers would be checked to make sure that none posed a threat.\n\nIn Paris after the assaults, a group of Afghans and others sleeping in parks and other spaces near the restaurants that were attacked expressed no fear of reprisals or mistreatment.\n\n\u201cI have been in Paris for a month, and I am very happy,\u201d said Azim Mghakhel, a young Afghan. \u201cThey give us what we need \u2014 bedding, food, showers.

The same property had already been set on fire in October.\n\nThe nationalist Alternative for Germany party, which has been unable to attract more than 5 percent of votes in elections, the threshold for representation in state or federal legislatures, has steadily increased its hold across the country.\n\n\u201cI told a refugee what had happened in Paris,\u201d said Mr. Aryubi, who volunteers with the Austrian branch of the Roman Catholic charity Caritas at the Westbahnhof train station in Vienna, where tens of thousands of refugees have arrived, most en route to Germany. \u201cThe refugee said, \u2018What happens if this happens again?
