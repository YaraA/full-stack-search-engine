Yanukovich, who was on a visit to Vienna, issued a statement saying, \u201cUkraine has been and will continue to pursue the path to European integration.\u201d\n\nIn a move emblematic of Ukraine\u2019s often inscrutable politics, Mr. Yanukovich barely acknowledged the developments in Kiev and, responding to a reporter\u2019s question about the pacts with Europe, said, \u201cOf course, there are difficulties on the path.\u201d\n\nBecause Mr. Yanukovich was supposed to sign the accords in Vilnius, some officials seemed to hold out the faint possibility he might find a way to resurrect the agreements. Those hopes seemed to fade Thursday night as the reactions in Europe grew angrier, and Russia said it would gladly join in negotiations if the accords were postponed.\n\nThe decree by the cabinet of ministers followed the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s overwhelming rejection of legislation that would have freed the country\u2019s jailed former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and allowed her to seek treatment in Germany for back problems. Ms. Tymoshenko is a bitter political rival of Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe West has long criticized the conviction of Ms. Tymoshenko on abuse of authority charges and her seven-year prison sentence, saying they were a politically motivated effort to sideline her. Her release was widely viewed as a condition of signing the agreements, although the European Union never officially declared it to be a requirement.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Yatsenyuk, a former minister of economy and foreign minister, who is the leader of the Fatherland party in Parliament.\n\nMoldova, the poorest country in Europe, is expected to move forward with the agreements in Vilnius even though Russia has banned imports of Moldovan wine, one of the country\u2019s most important exports, and has threatened other repercussions including an immigration crackdown on more than 100,000 Moldovans working in Russia.\n\nGeorgia, which fought a brief war with Russia in 2008 and remains in conflict with Russia over the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, is also planning to move forward with the accords. At his inauguration on Sunday, the country\u2019s new president, Giorgi Margvelashvili, said Georgia hoped to join the European Union and NATO.\n\nUkraine\u2019s domestic politics are deeply entwined with the country\u2019s relationship with Russia, and Mr. Yanukovich is widely viewed as calculating the implications of his decisions for his plans to seek re-election in 2015.\n\nMr. Yanukovich\u2019s political base is in the largely Russian-speaking southern and eastern sections of the country, which generally favor closer relations with Russia. Younger voters, and those in the central and western sections of the country, are more likely to favor integration with Europe; he would need their support to win a second term.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine is facing severe economic problems and will probably need a large infusion of credit. Those problems were certain to worsen if Russia followed through with threats of wide-ranging trade sanctions as retaliation for signing the deals with Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was unclear if the Kremlin had given Mr. Yanukovich any assurances of financial assistance. It seemed probable that Ukraine would face difficulties obtaining additional help from the International Monetary Fund after backing out of the agreements with Europe.\n\nOn Thursday, several hundred protesters gathered in Independence Square in Kiev. Carrying European flags, they chanted, \u201cUkraine is Europe!\u201d\n\nLinas Linkevicius, the foreign minister of Lithuania, which currently holds the European Union\u2019s rotating presidency, said that if Ukraine passed up the chance of signing a deal at the conference next week in Vilnius, it would have very little chance of doing so in the future. \u201cThe probability is likely close to zero,\u201d he said."}
