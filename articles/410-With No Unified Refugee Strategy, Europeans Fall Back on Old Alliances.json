Many states have balked, and the program is largely paralyzed.\n\nEuropean Union leaders also agreed to pay 3 billion euros, roughly $3.3 billion, to aid organizations in Turkey to help stanch the flow of migrants departing the Turkish coast for the Greek islands. But record numbers of migrants keep coming.\n\nWithout an effective Europe-wide policy response, and facing growing public anger in many countries, Europe\u2019s national leaders have splintered, searching for allies.\n\nPhoto\n\nOnly months ago, Austria, like Germany, symbolized Europe\u2019s welcoming embrace to Syrians and other refugees fleeing war and poverty. Now, Austria is defying European Union officials \u2014 and frustrating Ms. Merkel \u2014 by placing a cap on refugees.\n\nAustria also convened a meeting on Wednesday in Vienna with many of the Balkan states that last year had allowed migrants to cross their borders while traveling north toward Germany and Sweden.\n\nThe group in Vienna agreed to tighten limits on the number of migrants allowed to travel north, and pledged to help Macedonia clamp down on its southern border with Greece.\n\nPoland and Hungary are also providing help to Macedonia. Earlier, police chiefs in Austria, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia established tighter rules for screening migrants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTaken together, these moves threaten to turn Greece into the so-called refugee parking lot. Already, the Greek police have had to relocate several thousand migrants from the border checkpoint with Macedonia to refugee centers on the outskirts of Athens.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is incensed and Greece on Thursday recalled its ambassador to Austria. Greece\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a statement warning against the re-emergence of Europe\u2019s ancient rivalries.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the major problems of the European Union cannot be confronted via thoughts, attitudes and extra-institutional initiatives that have their roots in the 19th century,\u201d the statement said.\n\nGreece is now the primary entry point for Syrians and other refugees trying to reach Europe. Already this year, more than 100,000 migrants have landed on Greek islands, the International Organization for Migration has reported, a number that could ultimately top one million or more. Greek officials warn that the country \u2014 still reeling from the economic crisis \u2014 could be thrown into civil conflict if it becomes a dumping ground for migrants trying to reach the rest of Europe.\n\n\u201cThis is not a Greek problem,\u201d said Megan E. Greene, chief economist for Manulife Asset Management and a longtime analyst of Europe.\n\n\u201cIt is a European problem, and it needs a European solution. We are seeing \u2018solidarity\u2019 go out the window.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Greece would be left outside the bloc\u2019s de facto borders, despite being a European Union member. Yet Macedonia and Serbia, neither of which are members, would be inside.\n\nThe European Union will hold a pivotal March 7 meeting with Turkey to discuss the flow of refugees. European leaders will then gather in Brussels on March 17-18 for a summit meeting intended to achieve a unified migration policy \u2014 the session that represents Mr. Tusk\u2019s deadline.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLeaders like Ms. Merkel have long argued that migration demands a Europe-wide solution and is too big for any single country to adequately address. Yet it will not be easy.\n\nHungary is now planning to hold a public referendum on whether to accept or reject refugees. Italy \u2014 which has been dealing with migration for years \u2014 is calling for the creation of so-called Eurobonds to finance the response to the migration crisis \u2014 even as Germany and other countries remain wary.\n\nIn Germany, the political pressure on Ms. Merkel is only growing, and some predict that the anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party could make serious inroads in three important upcoming state elections.\n\nMoreover, Ms. Merkel\u2019s own re-election campaign next year could be in doubt. She has criticized Austria and the other countries for acting outside European Union parameters, and for potentially isolating Greece. Yet a policy to tighten borders and stem the refugee flow could likely help her politically.\n\n\u201cFor Germany, it is vital to bring the numbers down,\u201d said Almut M\u00f6ller, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.", "summary": "Greek officials warn that the country \u2014 still reeling from the economic crisis \u2014 could be thrown into civil conflict if it becomes a dumping ground for migrants trying to reach the rest of Europe.
