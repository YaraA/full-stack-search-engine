Yatsenyuk, is one of the main organizers of the protest movement, which ballooned in recent days to dominate the streets of Kiev and pressure Mr. Yanukovich after he refused to sign a political and trade pact with the European Union. Fatherland is best known, however, as the opposition coalition formed by the jailed former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, whose release has long been demanded by Western leaders.\n\n\u201cThey came without any notice, without any explanations, fully armed,\u201d said Natalia Lysova, a spokeswoman for Fatherland. \u201cThey broke the door, took all the servers and left.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, the security service, known as the S.B.U., issued a curt statement saying that it had opened an investigation into possible treason charges against unnamed politicians. At a news conference with other protest leaders on Monday, Mr. Yatsenyuk said that he had been summoned for questioning on Tuesday.\n\nVideo\n\nJust hours before the raid, Mr. Yanukovich signaled that he would accept a proposal by his three predecessors to hold \u201ca national round table for finding a compromise\u201d and that initial discussions would begin Tuesday.\n\nAny sense that his willingness to negotiate might defuse the crisis was quickly erased. \u201cWe saw on the Internet today some statement about the round table,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk said. \u201cWe would like to start by saying that it is very difficult to fit a round table into a square cell.\u201d\n\nWestern leaders issued a new round of warnings on Monday, more than a week after the violent crackdown on protesters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhite House officials said Mr. Biden had pressed Mr. Yanukovich to ease the crisis immediately and open talks with opposition leaders. Mr. Biden said that \u201cviolence has no place in a democratic society and is incompatible with our strategic relationship,\u201d according to a White House summary of the leaders\u2019 phone conversation.\n\nMs. Ashton, the European Union\u2019s envoy, was expected to arrive Tuesday. She had been deeply involved in efforts to draw Ukraine into closer ties with the union through the trade accord that Mr. Yanukovich abruptly backed away from late last month.\n\nThat decision to abandon wide-ranging trade and political agreements with the European Union left officials in Brussels deeply frustrated, upending years of efforts to draw Ukraine into Europe\u2019s orbit and away from Russia\u2019s.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Kravchuk, who was credited by Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s office with pushing the idea of round-table discussions.\n\nMr. Yanukovich\u2019s three predecessors \u2014 Mr. Kravchuk, Leonid D. Kuchma and Viktor A. Yushchenko \u2014 issued a statement last week calling for the \u201cround table\u201d talks, using the same phrase that described the negotiations that helped resolve the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine.\n\nThe announcement of possible negotiations was the first glimmer of engagement from Mr. Yanukovich after more than two weeks in which he largely waved off the growing national uproar.\n\nEven as Kiev convulsed in anger, he traveled to China on a state visit, then stopped in Russia to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin, further enraging the crowds already furious about the Kremlin\u2019s role in scuttling the accords with Europe.\n\nOn Monday, the Ukrainian authorities shut three subway stations in the city\u2019s center, including the two directly under the main protest site. In a statement, the Interior Ministry said it had acted in response to bomb threats. One station was later reopened.\n\nBut as police buses moved into lines just outside the perimeter of Independence Square, and officers took up new positions, demonstrators were bracing for action. They scrambled to reinforce barricades, moving public benches, wood planks and anything else available to add to the fortifications that have closed off the area for more than a week."}
