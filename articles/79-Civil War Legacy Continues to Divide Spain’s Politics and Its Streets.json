As in Valencia, the plan in Madrid is part of the so-called law of historical memory, introduced in 2007 by a Socialist prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero.\n\nAfter the Popular Party ousted the Socialists from power in late 2011, however, it froze public funding for projects related to the law, including efforts to identify the remains in about 2,000 mass graves.\n\nConservative politicians see such efforts as contrary to the principles of conciliation embodied in a 1977 amnesty law that was intended to help the country heal after Franco\u2019s death, and as evidence of political opportunism by left-wing parties.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They also point out that left-wing administrations have shown no similar zeal when it comes to discussing wartime atrocities committed by Franco\u2019s opponents, or even their own past choices of street names.\n\nIn the first year of the civil war, streets in Valencia were renamed to honor Lenin and the Soviet Union, as well as revolutionaries like Pancho Villa.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe left seems to want to change street names far more than the right, but this remains a sterile debate, driven by politics, that only helps increase divergences within the Spanish people,\u201d said Concepci\u00f3n Dancausa Trevi\u00f1o, who is the delegate of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government in the Madrid region.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we should just use street numbers, like in the United States, rather than keep making name changes that cost money and make no sense,\u201d she added.\n\nIn fact, at a time of strict budget cuts \u2014 another source of division between left and right \u2014 even the cost of such efforts has become a point of contention. While Madrid\u2019s City Hall estimated that its name-changing project would cost 60,000 euros, about $64,000, opponents say the final bill will be a hundred times as high.\n\nPhoto\n\nBeyond the name changes, Valencia is scheduling conferences, exhibitions and other events over the coming year to highlight its role as the short-lived capital of Republican Spain.\n\nAs Franco\u2019s troops advanced and the front line reached Madrid, Spain\u2019s Republican government moved to Valencia in November 1936 and stayed there until October 1937. A significant part of the nation\u2019s cultural patrimony was also relocated to relative safety in Valencia, including masterworks from the Prado museum in Madrid.\n\nBecoming the seat of government \u201creally transformed this city, also into a hub of social revolution and extraordinary cultural effervescence,\u201d said Jorge Ramos Tolosa, a history professor at the University of Valencia.\n\nLast month, City Hall awarded the honorific title of favorite daughter of Valencia to Alejandra Soler, a former leader of the student movement who got her degree in 1936, just before the civil war\u2019s outbreak, and escaped to the Soviet Union in 1939, after Franco\u2019s victory.\n\nMs. Soler, who is 102, recalled Valencia as \u201cmagnificent\u201d during its stint as Republican capital. \u201cThis was the meeting place of all the anti-Fascist people of the world, of the real believers in democracy,\u201d she said, sitting in her apartment filled with civil war memorabilia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe wartime importance of Valencia, however, also made it the target of 442 bombings during the civil war, mostly by Italian aircraft that formed part of the Fascist military support provided to Franco by Hitler and Mussolini.\n\nA local civic association wants to turn one of Valencia\u2019s former air raid shelters into a civil war museum \u2014 which would also breach something of a taboo in a country that has almost no such museums, not even in Madrid.\n\nSo sensitive is the period still that Santos Juli\u00e1, one of Spain\u2019s most respected historians, questioned the plan, suggesting perhaps the creation of a museum of 20th-century Spanish history instead.\n\n\u201cI think that to single out the civil war is still too polemic and doesn\u2019t really help explain history,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the civil war can\u2019t be understood without knowing what happened before, while what happened afterward can\u2019t be understood without knowing about the war.\u201d", "summary": "After the Popular Party ousted the Socialists from power in late 2011, however, it froze public funding for projects related to the law, including efforts to identify the remains in about 2,000 mass graves.Conservative politicians see such efforts as contrary to the principles of conciliation embodied in a 1977 amnesty law that was intended to help the country heal after Franco\u2019s death, and as evidence of political opportunism by left-wing parties.\u201cThe left seems to want to change street names far more than the right, but this remains a sterile debate, driven by politics, that only helps increase divergences within the Spanish people,\u201d said Concepci\u00f3n Dancausa Trevi\u00f1o, who is the delegate of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government in the Madrid region.Last month, City Hall awarded the honorific title of favorite daughter of Valencia to Alejandra Soler, a former leader of the student movement who got her degree in 1936, just before the civil war\u2019s outbreak, and escaped to the Soviet Union in 1939, after Franco\u2019s victory.The wartime importance of Valencia, however, also made it the target of 442 bombings during the civil war, mostly by Italian aircraft that formed part of the Fascist military support provided to Franco by Hitler and Mussolini."}
