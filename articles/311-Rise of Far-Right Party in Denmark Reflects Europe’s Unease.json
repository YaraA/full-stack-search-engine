{"title": "Rise of Far-Right Party in Denmark Reflects Europe\u2019s Unease", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/world/europe/rise-of-far-right-party-in-denmark-reflects-europes-unease.html", "body": "In Denmark, the center-left coalition lost to a center-right coalition, but the main surprise was the Danish People\u2019s Party, which ran second with 21 percent of the vote and beat the center-right Liberals four years after finishing third with 12 percent of the vote. The Liberals are likely to form a coalition government in any case, but the People\u2019s Party platform, appealing to anti-foreigner, anti-Islamic and nationalist sentiment while promising incentives to older people, suggested fundamental shifts in public opinion.\n\nThe same formula has been used by France\u2019s National Front, which is running strongly in opinion polls, as well as by similar parties in Finland, Sweden and Britain, where the U.K. Independence Party won only one seat in May\u2019s election but got nearly 13 percent of the vote.\n\nGreece is led by the far-left Syriza party, which won on a promise to end the austerity imposed by Brussels and to get a reduction in Greece\u2019s huge and probably unpayable mound of debt. Syriza, like many of the right-wing populist parties, appeals to voters unhappy with \u201cdictates\u201d from the European Union\u2019s headquarters in Brussels that trump national politics.\n\n\u201cSyriza and the Danish People\u2019s Party are mirror images of one another, part of the same megatrend now in many European countries,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThere is a remaking of the political order, with centrist parties that have run politics over the last few decades being hollowed out and replaced by parties appealing to the fringes.\u201d\n\nTo Mr. Leonard, the shift appears structural, similar to the way that liberal parties were weakened a century ago and then surpassed by socialist parties, like the Labour Party in Britain.\n\n\u201cGlobalization produces winners and losers, and large groups feel they\u2019ve been left behind, no longer represented by mainstream parties,\u201d Mr. Leonard said. \u201cThe parties of the left have become representatives of public-sector workers and the creative industries, while the right represents big business and finance, and both are rather liberal in social values. That leaves large segments of the population feeling angry and unrepresented, and new parties are emerging with a different language.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
