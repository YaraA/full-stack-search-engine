The latest edition of the weekly paper, devoted to mocking Europe\u2019s response to the migrant crisis, features a series of cartoons riffing on the harrowing image of the young boy\u2019s body as it was discovered, face down on a beach in Turkey.\n\nAs the French edition of Huffington Post reported, the cartoons caused barely a ripple of reaction in France, but the response was \u201cparticularly virulent among Internet users abroad.\u201d Indeed, two of the cartoons that circulated online, divorced from their context \u2014 rejected covers drawn by a Charlie Hebdo editor, Laurent Sourisseau, who uses the pen name Riss \u2014 were described by angry commentators in England, the United States and elsewhere as images that mocked the dead boy.\n\nEven as the outrage became the subject of reports in the international press, some observers, like the Egyptian artist Ganzeer, argued that the cartoons were not mocking the boy, but Europe.\n\nAnd in a scathing editorial introducing the issue, Mr. Sourisseau made it clear that his intended target was what he called the hypocritical response to the crisis by European leaders and the public. After comparing indifference to the plight of the migrants in France to attitudes toward Jews in 1941, the cartoonist mocked statements by the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, who suggested that an influx of Muslims from the Middle East threatened efforts to \u201ckeep Europe Christian.\u201d Mr. Sourisseau argued that this vision of Europe seemed to be based on a version of Christianity from which the ideal of Christian charity had been removed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of his cartoons, showing the young boy drowning alongside Jesus walking on water, illustrated this idea. \u201cThe Proof That Europe Is Christian,\u201d the cartoon was headlined. \u201cChristians walk on water,\u201d the text read, \u201cMuslim children sink.\u201d\n\nAs the French journalist Gilles Klein noted on Twitter, this cartoon\u2019s meaning seemed lost in translation by the time it crossed the channel and reached British tabloids, which reported on the outraged response to cartoons \u201cmocking the death\u201d of the boy from English observers, including Peter Herbert, a former vice chairman of London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Authority.\n\nIn his written introduction, Mr. Sourisseau also suggested that the response to the photograph of the boy was itself inappropriate and self-congratulatory. \u201cThis image is spoken of as a relic endowed with enormous powers, an icon that will bring back our faith and open our hearts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt must be so, Christian Europe. A Europe that still believes in miracles.\u201d"}
