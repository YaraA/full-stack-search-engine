{"title": "Charlie Hebdo\u2019s Defiant Muhammad Cover Fuels Debate on Free Speech", "authors": ["Dan Bilefsky"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/world/europe/new-charlie-hebdo-has-muhammad-cartoon.html", "body": "Beyond new threats \u2014 and the potential for more violence after a week in which both mosques and Jewish sites were attacked \u2014 the persistence of what many Muslims see as continuing provocations opened complaints about a double standard in European countries, whose bans on hate speech some see as seeming to stop short of forbidding ridicule of Islam.\n\n\u201cIf freedom of expression can be sacrificed for criminalizing incitement and hatred, why not for insulting the Prophet of Allah?\u201d Mr. Choudary wrote last week on Twitter on the same day as the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, during which the attackers indicated they were avenging Muhammad for the newspaper\u2019s insults.\n\nSupporters of the iconoclastic newspaper defended the cover as a fitting and defiant tribute to Charlie Hebdo\u2019s slain cartoonists. \u201cI have no worries about the cover,\u201d the cartoonist who drew it, Renald Luzier, who uses the pen name Luz, told assembled reporters at the offices of the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, which the Charlie Hedbo staff has used since the attack. \u201cWe have confidence in people\u2019s intelligence, and we have confidence in humor. The people who did this attack, they have no sense of humor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019ve drawn him yet again,\u201d he added, \u201cbut the Muhammad we\u2019ve drawn is a man who is crying.\u201d\n\nLaurent L\u00e9ger, an investigative journalist with Charlie Hebdo, shrugged off the idea, circulating on social media, that the cartoon contained one or even two hidden renderings of male genitals. \u201cPeople can see what they want to see, but a cartoon is a cartoon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a photograph.\u201d\n\nMuslim leaders as far away as Egypt condemned Charlie Hebdo, recalling threats received by a Danish newspaper in 2005 after it, too, published cartoons satirizing Muhammad.\n\nElsa Ray, the spokeswoman of the Paris-based Collective Against Islamophobia in France, declined to react specifically to the new cartoon, but said that cartoons that lampooned Muhammad breached the limits of decency and insulted Muslims. \u201cThe freedom of expression may be guaranteed by the French Constitution, but there is a limit when it goes too far and turns into hatred, and stigmatization,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMoreover, she argued that the failure of French courts to clamp down on cartoons satirizing Muhammad was a double standard, given the robustness of action taken when Jews were insulted by cartoonists or artists, including Dieudonn\u00e9 M\u2019bala M\u2019bala, a comedian, who in 2013 came under the scrutiny of courts, which banned a series of his shows.\n\nMr. M\u2019bala M\u2019bala has said it was a shame that a Jewish journalist had not been killed in the gas chambers. He has also come under fire for popularizing a gesture that strongly resembles a Nazi salute.\n\nIn a statement on his Facebook page after Sunday\u2019s enormous unity march in Paris, Mr. M\u2019bala M\u2019bala expressed his admiration for Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman behind the killings at a kosher supermarket. \u201cAs far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly,\u201d he wrote, alluding to the \u201cI am Charlie\u201d rallying cry. The Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said Monday it had opened an investigation to determine if Mr. M\u2019bala M\u2019bala should be charged with promoting terrorism.\n\nMr. M\u2019bala M\u2019bala said he was being unfairly targeted.\n\nFrench laws safeguard the freedom of speech, but there are many exceptions to the rule.\n\nMore on the Paris Shootings\n\nPrime Minister Manuel Valls told the National Assembly on Tuesday that \u201cblasphemy\u201d was not in French law and never would be. But he refused to draw any analogy between the satirists of Charlie Hebdo and Mr. M\u2019bala M\u2019bala.\n\n\u201cThere is a fundamental difference,\u201d he said.\n\nSome cultural observers praised Charlie Hebdo for upholding Western values of liberal democracy, even at risk of violence. Flemming Rose, the former cultural editor of the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, whose 2005 publication of cartoons lampooning Muhammad \u2014 including one with his turban depicted as a lit fuse \u2014 drew violent recriminations that reverberated across the world, recalled that the publication of the cartoons resulted in a fatwa against him by a radical cleric, threats against the newspaper and one of its cartoonists, and attacks against Danish embassies in the Middle East.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Still, he said it was imperative that Western newspapers not surrender to Islamic radicals.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t republishing the Charlie Hebdo cartoons because we are afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know well that if you give in to intimidation, it works.\u201d\n\nHis comments reflect the debate that last\u2019s week attacks have ignited in newsrooms and in the streets and cafes in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Fenoglio, the managing editor of Le Monde, said his paper had decided to publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoon on its cover because \u201cit is an important document that we wanted to show to everybody.\u201d The cartoon, Mr. Fenoglio said, \u201cdidn\u2019t carry any insulting message.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe defend our right to be able to publish any cartoon, but never those which would be aggressive,\u201d Mr. Fenoglio said. Though he said that some of Charlie Hebdo\u2019s caricatures were \u201cnot funny\u201d and could \u201cuselessly\u201d offend people, \u201ceach paper makes its own judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom of the press is an absolute right,\u201d Mr. Fenoglio said, \u201cbut each paper has its own free will, and chooses what seems pertinent or not.\u201d\n\nSome American newspapers, including The New York Times, did not reproduce the Charlie Hedbo cartoons that mocked Islam. The Times called the decision an editorial judgment that reflected its standards for content that is deemed offensive and gratuitous.\n\nThe decision drew criticism from some free-speech advocates who called it cowardly in the face of a terrorist attack, which the newspaper disputed.\n\n\u201cActually, we have republished some of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, including a caricature of the head of ISIS, as well as some political cartoons,\u201d Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said in a statement. \u201cWe do not normally publish images or other material deliberately intended to offend religious sensibilities.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post, which published a single previous Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Muhammad on its printed op-ed page last Thursday, republished the new cover on its website on Tuesday. Martin Baron, the newspaper\u2019s executive editor, said the images did not violate its editorial standards.\n\n\u201cIt has to be deliberately, pointedly, needlessly offensive,\u201d Mr. Baron said.\n\nMore publications have published or plan to reproduce Charlie Hebdo\u2019s newest cover online. Three million copies of the newspaper will be published on Wednesday in 16 languages.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe proliferation of the cartoons is heightening concern that the already precarious climate in Europe will worsen, with the possibility of more violence. Some newspapers that reproduced the cartoons in solidarity after last week\u2019s attack have themselves been threatened or targeted already.\n\nA Belgian newspaper, Le Soir, received an anonymous call Sunday from someone threatening that \u201cit\u2019s going to blow in your newsroom.\u201d\n\nThe same day, in Germany, stones and an incendiary object were thrown through the windows of the headquarters of a newspaper, Hamburger Morgenpost, damaging the archive but causing no injuries.\n\nKhalil Charles, spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain, said free speech had been allowed to defy common sense and had given way to insults. Referring to last week\u2019s attacks, he added: \u201cMuslims are appalled, like everyone, about what happened. But this is criminality that should not be attached to Islam, and the Prophet should not be attacked as a result.\u201d", "summary": "Beyond new threats \u2014 and the potential for more violence after a week in which both mosques and Jewish sites were attacked \u2014 the persistence of what many Muslims see as continuing provocations opened complaints about a double standard in European countries, whose bans on hate speech some see as seeming to stop short of forbidding ridicule of Islam.\u201cI have no worries about the cover,\u201d the cartoonist who drew it, Renald Luzier, who uses the pen name Luz, told assembled reporters at the offices of the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, which the Charlie Hedbo staff has used since the attack.Laurent L\u00e9ger, an investigative journalist with Charlie Hebdo, shrugged off the idea, circulating on social media, that the cartoon contained one or even two hidden renderings of male genitals.The Washington Post, which published a single previous Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Muhammad on its printed op-ed page last Thursday, republished the new cover on its website on Tuesday.The same day, in Germany, stones and an incendiary object were thrown through the windows of the headquarters of a newspaper, Hamburger Morgenpost, damaging the archive but causing no injuries."}
