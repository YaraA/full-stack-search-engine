He told a party conference on Saturday that the Catalan vote had no validity and would have \u201cno effect whatsoever.\u201d Speaking on Sunday on behalf of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, Mr. Catal\u00e1, the justice minister, also stressed the vote had no legal implications for Spain and warned instead that the attorney general\u2019s office was probing whether charges could be filed against the Catalan organizers of an invalid poll.\n\nWhile trying not to be held responsible for provoking a constitutional crisis in Spain, Mr. Mas has been under pressure from other secessionist politicians to keep Catalonia\u2019s independence plans on track.In recent weeks, the Constitutional Court repeatedly sided with Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, forcing Mr. Mas to adjust his plans in order to circumvent legal and political objections from Madrid.\n\nVideo\n\nAs a result, the straw poll was organized without any official census of the electorate. In fact, to avoid any institutional involvement, Mr. Mas relied on about 40,000 volunteers to take charge of the ballot. The result is thus unlikely to receive the international recognition that Mr. Mas had originally hoped for.\n\nStill, Maria Pilar Lahoz, a history professor who voted Sunday in the Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood of Barcelona, said that her vote had \u201cfull validity for me, even if Madrid doesn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nShe forecast independence within the coming decade. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be a long struggle, but it\u2019s unstoppable and the door has now at least been opened,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2012, when Catalonia last held regional elections, secessionist parties got about 1.8 million votes of 3.7 million cast. Comparisons are hard to make, given the informal nature of the straw poll. Catalans aged 16 and over were allowed to take part, while in 2012, only those 18 and older could vote. The straw poll was also open to foreign residents of Catalonia, as well as to Catalans living outside the region.\n\nCorinna Duschat, a German who has been living in Catalonia for five years and also voted in the Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood, said she was concerned about any attempt to restrict the right of people to vote in a functioning democracy. \u201cI don\u2019t see how Madrid thinks this is an issue that can just be ignored,\u201d she said.In Hong Kong, Coral Puig, who has lived outside of Catalonia for the last four years, volunteered to help organize a local vote for Catalans. \u201cI want to be legally recognized as a Catalan citizen worldwide,\u201d she said by email. \u201cI am not Spanish, and we have been waiting for centuries to get back our identity.\u201d"}
