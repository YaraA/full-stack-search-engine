By forcing new elections with the no-confidence vote, the Communists gain a chance to return to power after four years in opposition.\n\nThe government had hoped to sign an association agreement with the European Union later this year. That has been one of Mr. Filat\u2019s primary goals since his coalition, the Alliance for European Integration, wrested power from the Communists in the 2009 elections.\n\n\u201cRight now we are observing a crisis,\u201d said Oazu Nantoi, program director at the Institute for Public Policy in Chisinau, the capital. Though the European Union was preparing for negotiations with Mr. Filat\u2019s government, he said, \u201cthe alliance, de facto, no longer exists. What happens now is very difficult to say.\u201d\n\nThe alliance had been coming apart for some time. Mr. Filat ripped up the compact binding the three parties last month, and issued a fiery statement accusing some of its leaders of reviving \u201cCommunist era\u201d corruption schemes. His allies then called for his resignation; one of them, Marian Lupu, led the 15 members of the Democratic Party to join the Communists in voting against the government on Tuesday.\n\nMoldova is a relatively poor country of four million people wedged between Romania, a member of the European Union, and Ukraine; it is divided politically between those who look to the West or to Russia as guarantors of reform and stability. Russian troops are stationed in the section east of the Dniester River, which has broken away from the central government\u2019s control, and Russia supplies most of the country\u2019s energy."}
