In some recent polls, greater numbers have said they intend to vote for independence.\n\nGiven the unpopularity of Mr. Cameron and his Conservative Party in Scotland, which is dominated by the Scottish National Party and the opposition Labour Party, Mr. Cameron has been wary of intervening too much in the debate, fearing a counterproductive effect. The pro-union campaign, which is meant to be nonpartisan, is led by Alistair Darling, a Labour member of Parliament from Scotland and former chancellor of the Exchequer, who had a cabinet post during the entire Labour reign from 1997 to 2010.\n\nMr. Darling and his team have been emphasizing questions about whether an independent Scotland would have to reapply to join the European Union, whether it could continue to use the pound or adopt the euro, whether it would have a truly independent central bank, and even whether oil and gas revenues from declining production in the North Sea would be enough to fund Scotland\u2019s budget.\n\nThe immediate response from the Scottish National Party to the excerpts \u2014 the \u201cpreaction,\u201d as one BBC radio announcer put it \u2014 was predictably critical, accusing Mr. Cameron of being afraid to come to Scotland and debate the party leader, Alex Salmond.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Salmond called Mr. Cameron \u201ca big feartie,\u201d or coward, for refusing a face-to-face debate.\n\nScotland\u2019s deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said in a statement, \u201cThis is a cowardly speech from a prime minister who uses the Olympic Park in London to give highhanded lectures against Scotland\u2019s independence but hasn\u2019t got the guts to come to Scotland or anywhere else to make his case.\u201d\n\nTouching on Mr. Cameron\u2019s image as an elite, Eton-educated southerner, she said, \u201cDavid Cameron, as the Tory prime minister, is the very embodiment of the democratic case for a \u2018yes\u2019 vote for an independent Scotland \u2014 and he knows it.\u201d\n\nShe argued that using the Olympic Stadium on the day the Winter Olympics formally opened in Sochi, Russia, \u201cseeking to invoke the successes of London 2012 as an argument against Scotland taking its future into its own hands,\u201d only \u201cbetrays the extent of the jitters now running through the \u2018no\u2019 campaign.\u201d", "summary": "Scottish independence would \u201crip the rug from under our own reputation,\u201d Mr. Cameron said, arguing that \u201cwe matter more in the world together\u201d \u2014 the same argument used by Britons who want Britain to remain in the European Union.He also mentioned Scotch whisky, saying it \u201cadds \u00a3135 to the U.K.'s balance of payments every single second,\u201d which in another context might be an incentive for Scots to vote for independence.However, with Britons anxious about making ends meet, Mr. Cameron did not mention Adam Smith, the Scot famous for his theory of the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the free market.About four million people over the age of 16 and living in Scotland will be able to take part in the referendum, promised by the governing Scottish National Party, on Sept. 18.Early opinion polls have shown a large plurality of Scots intending to vote to remain in the union, but the numbers are soft."}
