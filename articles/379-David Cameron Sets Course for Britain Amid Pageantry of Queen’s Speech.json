On Wednesday, she traveled to Parliament in a horse-drawn carriage. As custom dictates, her arrival was preceded by a search by lantern light of the cellars of Parliament to prevent a repeat of a failed plot to blow it up in 1605.\n\nThe address, known as the Queen\u2019s Speech, reflected the different set of political obstacles that Mr. Cameron will face in his second term. Plans for a British bill of rights that would limit the reach of European laws on human rights were mentioned in terms that suggest they are likely to be delayed. And there were no details about how he would put in place one of his central pledges: a reduction of around 12 billion pounds, or about $18.5 billion, in welfare spending. Before the election, Mr. Cameron also promised not to increase income tax, the value-added tax \u2014 the main sales tax \u2014 or social security payments known as national insurance, although that still gives him some leeway to raise other taxes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Although that constrained him, it also provided him with an excuse to soft-pedal issues that were either a lower priority or more politically complex.", "summary": "Although the text outlining the government\u2019s legislative goals was read by Queen Elizabeth II at the State Opening of Parliament, in keeping with tradition, the program was Mr. Cameron\u2019s: a bill for a referendum on membership in the European Union, along with measures to expand homeownership, curb immigration, increase the powers of Scotland\u2019s Parliament, and give the security services greater authority to monitor and restrain potential terrorists.As custom dictates, her arrival was preceded by a search by lantern light of the cellars of Parliament to prevent a repeat of a failed plot to blow it up in 1605.The address, known as the Queen\u2019s Speech, reflected the different set of political obstacles that Mr. Cameron will face in his second term.Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.During his first term in power, Mr. Cameron had to negotiate with his junior coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, about which measures would be put into law."}
