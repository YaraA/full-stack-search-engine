Says", "authors": ["Sewell Chan"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/europe/no-end-in-sight-to-tide-of-migrants-entering-europe-un-says.html", "body": "Prime Minister Juha Sipila, who has offered to personally shelter refugees in his home, called the protests racist. \u201cFinland is an international, open and tolerant country,\u201d with the majority of the population accepting of immigrants, he said in a joint statement with his finance and foreign ministers.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian border has come into focus as one of the main nodes of the human exodus.\n\nUp to 10,000 migrants have been entering Austria daily, mostly from Hungary; 134,000 made the crossing from Sept. 5 to 23, Austrian officials said Friday. While many of the migrants have continued on, to destinations like Germany and Sweden, 500 to 700 people each day have filed papers to stay in Austria, officials said.\n\nAfter Hungary fenced off its border with Serbia last week, migrants turned to Croatia, entering Hungary through a different route \u2014 with the grudging acceptance of the Hungarian authorities \u2014 and then heading to Austria. Hungary on Friday continued to seal its border with Croatia, which like Serbia is not part of the passport-free Schengen travel zone that has been a cornerstone of European unity.\n\nAustria\u2019s left-leaning chancellor, Werner Faymann, and Hungary\u2019s conservative prime minister, Viktor Orban, met in Vienna on Friday to discuss the situation. While they have divergent political stances, they agreed on the need for cooperation to manage the westward flow of immigrants.\n\nThe Austrians emphasized the European Union\u2019s procedures for accommodating and processing asylum seekers and described Hungary\u2019s fence construction along its borders with Serbia and Croatia as a matter for Hungarians to decide.\n\n(Hungary has also placed a razor-wire barrier along parts of its border with Slovenia \u2014 which like Hungary is part of the Schengen zone \u2014 but on Friday, news reports from Slovenia said at least part of the wire fence had been taken down. Karl Erjavec, Slovenia\u2019s foreign minister, told state television that the Hungarian government had assured him that it would not extend the barrier along the entire 60-mile border between the two countries.)\n\nMr. Orban has considered tougher measures to seal the border with Croatia, but he pledged on Friday to consult Hungary\u2019s neighbors first. Criticized by humanitarian groups for his harsh language toward refugees, Mr. Orban on Friday described his objections as more pragmatic than ideological.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But local business interests and the Croatian Chamber of Commerce said a prolonged two-way blockade of Serbian-registered vehicles and trucks carrying Croatian goods could cost the economies of both countries millions of euros.\n\n\u201cOur measures at the border may have been hard, but it was in defense of national interests and to control the flow of migrants who pass through Serbia without any control,\u201d said Croatia\u2019s prime minister, Zoran Milanovic, comparing government leaders to the notorious Serb strongman Slobodan Milosevic.\n\nIn Serbia, Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic called the lifting of the blockade \u201ca great victory for all citizens of Serbia,\u201d according to the Tanjug state news agency.\n\nMr. Stefanovic added that Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic had scheduled a cabinet meeting for Friday evening and that he expected the agenda to include discussion of Serbia\u2019s repealing the countermeasures it adopted Thursday.\n\nThe diversity of the migrants \u2014 some have made their way to Europe from as far away as Afghanistan and Eritrea \u2014 has caught European leaders by surprise. While the four-year-old civil war in Syria has been one of the most obvious causes, United Nations officials are also pointing to the deteriorating situation in Iraq.\n\nAbout 500,000 Iraqis could be displaced if the government, as expected, begins an offensive to retake the city of Mosul, which Islamic State forces captured last year, officials said in Geneva.\n\n\u201cThe humanitarian situation is worsening dramatically,\u201d said Dominik Bartsch, the refugee agency\u2019s deputy coordinator in Iraq, citing a recent cholera outbreak and estimating that 10 million people, or one-quarter of the population, will need humanitarian aid by the end of the year.\n\nPeter Webinger, deputy director of the department for migration and asylum affairs at Austria\u2019s Interior Ministry, said the new physical barriers would be a futile exercise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPeople on the move are like water,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put a barrier to stop it, and it will find a way to flow around it.\u201d", "summary": "The Austrians emphasized the European Union\u2019s procedures for accommodating and processing asylum seekers and described Hungary\u2019s fence construction along its borders with Serbia and Croatia as a matter for Hungarians to decide.
