It is further complicated by a legitimate news reason \u2014 Charlie Hebdo\u2019s response to the deadly assault \u2014 that would seem to justify showing precisely what the newspaper did in its response.\n\n\u201cNewspapers have to consider their audience, who reads their publication,\u201d said Martha Steffens, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism and an executive board member at the International Press Institute, an advocacy group. \u201cEvery news outlet is not going to make the same decision.\u201d\n\nProfessor Steffens, who was coincidentally visiting Paris last week with some students when the attacks took place, said that what might be different in the decision making this week was the newsworthiness of the Charlie Hebdo attack and its aftermath.\n\nMore on the Paris Shootings\n\n\u201cThis is newsworthy because it\u2019s the cover of a newspaper after a terrible tragedy,\u201d she said.\n\nAt The Times, which republished some Charlie Hebdo cartoons in its coverage of the attack, but not the ones that mocked Islam, an editorial decision was made in its online coverage to provide a link for viewers to click should they wish to see the new Muhammad cover. But the image will not be published in the print edition.\n\n\u201cActually we have republished some of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons including a caricature of the head of ISIS as well as some political cartoons,\u201d Dean Baquet, executive editor of The Times, said in a statement. \u201cWe do not normally publish images or other material deliberately intended to offend religious sensibilities. Many Muslims consider publishing images of their prophet innately offensive and we have refrained from doing so.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

BuzzFeed, the online news site, ran previous Charlie Hebdo cartoons deemed offensive by Muslims and featured an image of the Wednesday cover in an article about how other publications were dealing with it. The BuzzFeed article portrayed those who chose not to republish as practicing self-censorship.\n\nThe Washington Post, which published a single image of a previous Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Muhammad on its printed op-ed page last Thursday, republished the new cover on its website on Tuesday. Martin Baron, the newspaper\u2019s executive editor, said the images did not violate its editorial standards.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt has to be deliberately, pointedly, needlessly offensive,\u201d Mr. Baron said.\n\nIn France, other newspapers have rallied to aid Charlie Hebdo. Its latest issue has been assembled in the offices of the left-wing newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, some of whose staff members posted the image on Twitter earlier this week. In London, the newspaper The Guardian published the cartoon, but a web version of its article warns readers that it \u201ccontains the image of the magazine cover, which some may find offensive.\u201d\n\nAdding to the debate over publishing the cartoon, some online commentators have also asserted that, if viewed upside down, the image could be seen as a depiction of the male anatomy. Many previous Charlie Hebdo images satirizing religious leaders have also included subtle or explicit pornographic references.\n\nLaurent L\u00e9ger, an investigative journalist with Charlie Hebdo, shrugged off the idea, circulating on social media, that the new cartoon of Muhammad contained one or even two drawings of male genitals.\n\n\u201cPeople can see what they want to see, but a cartoon is a cartoon. It is not a photograph. Who\u2019s to say what Muhammad looks like. I haven\u2019t seen him myself,\u201d Mr. Leger said.\n\nJoel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based advocacy group, said he was concerned that the debate over the Charlie Hebdo cartoons had conflated the issues of free-speech and editorial judgment.\n\n\u201cSome people agree, some disagree. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s evidence to suggest the decision was made because of threats of violence,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing that troubles me: This is a time when, regardless of your decision to publish or not, we need to stand together behind the principle of freedom of expression. I\u2019d hate to see this become divisive.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cNewspapers have to consider their audience, who reads their publication,\u201d said Martha Steffens, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism and an executive board member at the International Press Institute, an advocacy group.BuzzFeed, the online news site, ran previous Charlie Hebdo cartoons deemed offensive by Muslims and featured an image of the Wednesday cover in an article about how other publications were dealing with it.The Washington Post, which published a single image of a previous Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Muhammad on its printed op-ed page last Thursday, republished the new cover on its website on Tuesday.Laurent L\u00e9ger, an investigative journalist with Charlie Hebdo, shrugged off the idea, circulating on social media, that the new cartoon of Muhammad contained one or even two drawings of male genitals.Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based advocacy group, said he was concerned that the debate over the Charlie Hebdo cartoons had conflated the issues of free-speech and editorial judgment."}
