{"title": "Angela Merkel Makes History in German Vote, but So Does Far Right", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger", "Melissa Eddy"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/world/europe/germany-election-merkel.html", "body": "She said that she would listen to those who voted for the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, and work to win them back \u201cby solving problems, by taking up their worries, partly also their fears, but above all by good politics.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut her comments seemed to augur a shift to the right and more of an emphasis on controls over borders, migration and security.\n\nDespite her victory, Ms. Merkel and her conservatives cannot lead alone, making it probable that the chancellor\u2019s political life in her fourth term will be substantially more complicated.\n\nThe shape and policies of a new governing coalition will involve weeks of painstaking negotiations. Smiling, Ms. Merkel said Sunday night that she hoped to have a new government \u201cby Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe center-left Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition partners for the last four years, ran a poor second to her center-right grouping, and the Social Democrats announced Sunday evening that the party would go into opposition, hoping to rebuild their political profile.\n\nBut the step would also make sure that the AfD stays on the political sidelines and does not become the country\u2019s official opposition.\n\nThe Alternative for Germany nonetheless vowed to shake the consensus politics of Germany, and in breaking a postwar taboo by entering Parliament, it already had.\n\nAlexander Gauland, one of AfD\u2019s leaders, told party supporters after the results that in Parliament: \u201cWe will go after them. We will claim back our country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo cheers, he said: \u201cWe did it. We are in the German Parliament and we will change Germany.\u201d\n\nBurkhard Schr\u00f6der, an AfD member since 2014 from D\u00fcsseldorf, was ecstatic. \u201cWe are absolutely euphoric here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a strong victory for us that has weakened Angela Merkel.\u201d\n\nUp to 700 protesters gathered outside the AfD\u2019s election night party, chanting slogans like \u201cAll of Berlin, hate the AfD.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to show that it\u2019s not normal that a neofascist party got into the German Parliament,\u201d said Dirk Schuck, 41, a political scientist at the University of Leipzig.\n\nWhile both Ms. Merkel and the Social Democrats lost significant voter support from 2013, her victory vaults her into the ranks of Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, the only postwar chancellors to win four national elections.\n\nThe election is a remarkable capstone for Ms. Merkel, 63, the first East German and the first woman to become chancellor.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt also represents a vindication of her pragmatic leadership and confidence in her stewardship of Europe\u2019s largest economy and of the European Union itself in the face of populism, challenges from Russia and China and uncertainty created by the unpredictable policies of President Trump.\n\nEven so, the advance of the far right was a cold slap for her and the Christian Democratic Union, or CDU. The AfD made particular inroads in the former East Germany but also in Bavaria, where Ms. Merkel\u2019s sister party, the Christian Social Union, or CSU, has long led but lost some 10 percent of its vote over 2013.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHorst Seehofer, the CSU leader, said, \u201cWe made the mistake of having the right flank open.\u201d\n\nA critic of Ms. Merkel\u2019s immigration policies, he added, \u201cWe have a vacuum on the right, we will close it with politics that ensure Germany remains Germany.\u201d\n\nThe late leader of that party, Franz-Josef Strauss, said in 1986 that the party should allow no one to run to its right. \u201cTo the right of us there is only the wall,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Seehofer echoed that insight Sunday night. But others cautioned calm.\n\n\u201cWe will remember today in history,\u201d said Thomas Heilmann, a member of Parliament from the CDU, in an email interview. \u201cAs in the U.S., hate became part of politics. The CDU cannot and must not match this attitude.\u201d\n\nGoverning Germany \u201cwill become more difficult,\u201d Mr. Heilmann added. \u201cIt is definitely not a good day for Germany and most likely not good for Europe either.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nClemens Fuest, the director of IFO, the Institute for Economic Research in Munich, said that the results showed wide concern about \u201csecurity, immigration and possible challenges to the German economic model, like globalization.\u201d\n\nThese mattered more than the Social Democrats\u2019 concentration on injustice and inequality, he said.\n\nThe other parties should make less of the AfD showing \u201cand instead ask themselves what questions they have not answered\u201d \u2014 questions of borders, migration and the pressures on Germany to do more to prop up other countries of the European Union.\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc won some 32.9 percent of the vote, sharply down from 41.5 percent in 2013, the early results showed.\n\nThe Social Democrats slumped to 20.8 percent, a new postwar low, down from 25.7 percent four years ago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf the Social Democrats hold to their intention to go into opposition, Ms. Merkel will be faced with an unusually difficult task to form a working coalition. Given the numbers, it would seem that she will have to cobble together her own Christian Democrat-Christian Social Union bloc together with two other parties.\n\nThe potential new partners inhabit virtually opposite poles on the political spectrum \u2014 the pro-business Free Democrats, who won some 10.4 percent of the vote, and the left-leaning pro-environment Greens, who won about 9 percent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Morning Briefing What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox.

To counteract the AfD, he said, \u201cWe need to address the issue of strengthening the borders.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Wexler said he was most disturbed by the AfD\u2019s hostility to the European Union. \u201cThis is what Germany needs to do \u2014 be a strong leader in Europe.\u201d\n\nBut Hans Kundnani, an expert on Germany with the German Marshall Fund, said that Ms. Merkel might fail to create the three-party coalition, putting the Social Democrats under great pressure to join another coalition rather than forcing new elections.\n\nTo Mr. Kundnani, \u201cthe big shock is not the AfD,\u201d but the loss of support for Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the increasing fragmentation of German political life.\n\nGermany has a complicated system of proportional representation, in which each voter casts one ballot for a local representative and one ballot for a political party. Those elected locally get their seats.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the parties\u2019 overall share of seats in parliament is determined by the percentage of votes they win. Turnout was 75.9 percent, up from 71.5 percent in 2013, but a long way from the 90 percent turnout figures of the 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough initially reluctant to run for a fourth term, Ms. Merkel threw herself into the campaign, especially as the government has brought some order to the chaos engendered in 2015 when she threw the country\u2019s borders open to refugees and migrants.\n\nBut the backlash over the migrant crisis, coupled with her long period in office and the wishy-washy nature of grand coalition politics, has led to more support for the more extreme, anti-European parties like the AfD and The Left, the heir of the East German Communist Party, which came in third in 2013 and won about 9 percent of the vote on Sunday.\n\nIn Dresden, Gert Fr\u00fclling, 75, a retiree, declined to divulge his party preference, but made it clear that he was sympathetic to some of the Alternative for Germany\u2019s proposals.\n\n\u201cIt all happened too fast,\u201d he said, referring to the time after Germany\u2019s reunification. \u201cDresden is a city of bureaucrats and soldiers, and they dumped all this multiculturalism on us at once. I know we had to change, but it should have happened more gradually.\u201d\n\nHe said it would be wrong for other parties to refuse to work with the AfD in Parliament. \u201cIf they present good ideas,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s not fair to boycott them.\u201d\n\nIn Neustadt, a gentrifying area of Dresden, Rebecca Klingenburg, 20, was clearly excited to be one of an estimated three million first-time voters.\n\n\u201cOne gets to decide on what country one wants to live,\u201d she said. A mechanical-engineering student, Ms. Klingenburg said she was voting to maintain Germany\u2019s orientation toward Europe, at a time of rising nationalism.\n\n\u201cI learned four languages in school,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to make sure that we stay internationally oriented.\u201d", "summary": "She said that she would listen to those who voted for the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, and work to win them back \u201cby solving problems, by taking up their worries, partly also their fears, but above all by good politics.\u201dWhile both Ms. Merkel and the Social Democrats lost significant voter support from 2013, her victory vaults her into the ranks of Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, the only postwar chancellors to win four national elections.It also represents a vindication of her pragmatic leadership and confidence in her stewardship of Europe\u2019s largest economy and of the European Union itself in the face of populism, challenges from Russia and China and uncertainty created by the unpredictable policies of President Trump.The AfD made particular inroads in the former East Germany but also in Bavaria, where Ms. Merkel\u2019s sister party, the Christian Social Union, or CSU, has long led but lost some 10 percent of its vote over 2013.In Dresden, Gert Fr\u00fclling, 75, a retiree, declined to divulge his party preference, but made it clear that he was sympathetic to some of the Alternative for Germany\u2019s proposals."}
