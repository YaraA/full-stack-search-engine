Analysts said the Bavarian party\u2019s venture into delicate immigration politics was intended to signal that it cared about issues of cultural identity that have been highlighted by weekly demonstrations in Dresden and the rise of a new populist party, the Alternative for Germany.\n\nIn Dresden on Monday night, about 10,000 people heeded the call of the anti-immigration group Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, known by its German acronym, Pegida, which has staged ever-larger demonstrations over the last eight Mondays.\n\nThis time, however, some 9,000 people turned out against Pegida, Lutz Z\u00f6llner, a police official, said by telephone. The anti-Pegida demonstration had the support of the state governor, the mayor of Dresden, the local Jewish community and diverse groups of artists, students and others. Some 1,400 police officers, including some brought in from other parts of Germany, kept the two groups apart, and no major violence or arrests were reported, Mr. Z\u00f6llner said.\n\nMr. Scheuer insisted that the meaning of the proposal had been misunderstood. \u201cFrom the beginning, there was no talk of obligation, bossing people around or inspections,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore the Bavarian party\u2019s retreat, Ms. Merkel weighed in stating it is \u201cgood when you have one less foreign language to acquire,\u201d because you are fluent in two.\n\nHer spokesman, Steffen Seibert, noted more dryly that language \u201cis not a government matter.\u201d"}
