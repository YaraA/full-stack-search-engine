It lifted the restrictions after a week, but a senior economic aide to President Vladimir V. Putin said that they could become permanent if Ukraine, as expected, signs agreements with the European Union at the conference next month \u2014 a step that the aide, Sergei Glazyev, said would be \u201csuicidal.\u201d\n\nIn September, Armenia, which is heavily dependent on Russia for security reasons, simply capitulated. After a meeting with Mr. Putin in Moscow, President Serzh Sargsyan abruptly declared that Armenia would join the Kremlin\u2019s customs union, scrapping years of work toward agreements under the European Union\u2019s Eastern Partnership program.\n\nMr. Sargsyan\u2019s unexpected move shocked many Armenians and set off a protest in Yerevan, the capital, by several thousand people who noted that their country does not share a common border with any of the customs union members. It also startled the Europeans, who began scrambling to prevent further defections.\n\nThis month, Russia took aim at Lithuania, which has already joined the European Union and whose capital, Vilnius, is the site of next month\u2019s conference. Russia briefly stiffened customs inspections on Lithuanian goods, and has banned milk and other dairy imports.\n\nNowhere, however, is the pressure more intense than here in Moldova, a tiny, landlocked nation of 3.6 million people wedged between Romania and Ukraine that is by far the poorest country on the Continent, with annual economic output of about $3,500 per person \u2014 less than half that of Albania.\n\nIn addition to the ban on Moldovan wine, there have been rumors that tens of thousands of Moldovans who work in Russia would be expelled in an immigration crackdown, cutting off a financial lifeline for many families. There are also fears of a ban on apples or other produce, which would be devastating if imposed during harvest season.\n\nRather than intimidating leaders of the country\u2019s fragile coalition government, however, Russia\u2019s tactics have only cemented their resolve to complete the political and free trade agreements with the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe signing of these agreements is the only chance that Moldova has in order to develop itself as a European country and in the European spirit,\u201d President Nicolae Timofti said in an interview.\n\nMr. Timofti said it was clear that the ban on wine imports was about politics and Russia\u2019s increasingly unrealistic goal of reuniting the former Soviet republics in an economic alliance through the customs union.\n\n\u201cWe realize Russia has geopolitical interests in this area but there is also a saying here \u2014 \u2018You cannot enter the same river twice,\u2019 \u201d the president said. \u201cIt is impossible to recreate the union that used to exist. However, Russia does take action to keep its influence over this region.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Timofti and other government officials said the Russian approach was backfiring, both politically and economically, leading businesses to reduce their reliance on the Russian market.\n\nWhen Russia imposed a similar ban on Moldovan wine in 2006, officials said, exports to Russia accounted for more than 70 percent of the industry. Today, it is less than 30 percent, and several winery executives said they had ceased doing business with Russia entirely.\n\n\u201cWe stopped working with the Russian market in 2009,\u201d said Andrei Sirbu, whose family owns the Asconi Winery in Puhoi, a village 20 miles southeast of Chisinau (pronounced KISH-e-now). \u201cIt\u2019s a very attractive market when you look at the sales opportunities, the size of it. Just in Moscow, you can do so much business, but when you put the politics into it, that\u2019s the problem \u2014 the political risk.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Early this month, Mr. Rogozin, the Russian deputy prime minister, posted a Twitter message suggesting that Romania had a secret plan to annex Moldova, after supporting Moldova\u2019s integration into Europe.\n\nSome Moldovan officials have also accused Russia of fomenting unrest in the country by inflaming the dispute with Trans-Dniester, a breakaway territory that has declared independence and where about a thousand Russian troops remain stationed, and also by financing political groups aiming to topple the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Communist Party, which still has the single largest bloc in Parliament and currently opposes the political and trade pacts with Europe, this month began demanding early elections in an effort to dislodge the current government. On Tuesday, Parliament for the second time in two weeks rejected a vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d in the government proposed by the Communists.\n\nThe government nearly fell apart earlier this year after a bizarre series of events that began last December when a businessman was accidentally killed on a hunting trip involving some of the country\u2019s top officials. Vlad Filat, then the prime minister, was ousted in the ensuing controversy.\n\nThe current prime minister, Mr. Leanca, said that while the government was pursuing overhauls, including anticorruption measures and an overhaul of the judicial system, in hopes of eventually joining the European Union, the outcome was not yet certain. \u201cThere are still threats, and it comes from the fact that we have not reached yet the irreversibility of our development, of our future path,\u201d Mr. Leanca said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an interview, he described Moldova as at a crossroads. \u201cWe could go one way, which would mean embracing democratic values and on those values to build a viable society, and a functioning society with a prosperous economy,\u201d he said. \u201cOr we can stay forever in this gray area, where there is no rule of law, where people do not have confidence in their future and therefore they leave the country.\u201d\n\nIulian Groza, a deputy foreign minister, said that focusing on Europe, a market of 500 million people, was an obvious choice \u2014 and one that Moldova made long ago \u2014 and that Russia should accept Moldova\u2019s policy decisions. \u201cWe want to be treated by our bigger partners, if not equally, at least with respect,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Timofti said he believed that Moldova would join the European Union, and even predicted good relations with Russia in the future. \u201cPerhaps at some point in the future, Russia itself will become a member of the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will be together again.\u201d"}
