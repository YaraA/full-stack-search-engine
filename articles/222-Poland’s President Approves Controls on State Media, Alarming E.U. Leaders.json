Until now, politically independent bodies made those decisions.\n\nMalgorzata Sadurska, who as the head of the presidential chancellery is Mr. Duda\u2019s top aide, said the new law was intended to ensure that the state news media are \u201cunbiased, objective and credible.\u201d\n\nAfter the lower house of the Polish Parliament passed the measure on Dec. 30, the European Commission took the extraordinary step of scheduling a discussion for Jan. 13 on rule of law in Poland. The European Union, which Poland joined in 2004, requires that member states respect the rule of law; a country that is found to systematically violate the rule of law can be stripped of voting rights, something that has never happened in the bloc\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cFreedom and pluralism of the media are crucial for a pluralist society,\u201d Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, told Polish officials in a letter.\n\nThe new law has added to anxiety in Brussels over the actions of Poland\u2019s new government, which include pardoning the head of the security services, who was appealing a conviction for abuse of his office; trying to halt the production of a play it deemed \u201cpornographic;\u201d and vowing to overturn the previous government\u2019s promise to accept some of the refugees pouring into Europe.", "summary": "WARSAW \u2014 Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, signed a law on Thursday that gives the government greater control over state broadcasters, despite the objections of European Union officials who fear that the measure will weaken freedom of the press.
