{"title": "Remembering Slain Critic of Putin, Tens of Thousands March in Moscow", "authors": ["Andrew E.

One placard read, \u201cBoris, we will continue your work.\u201d\n\nRussian news media reported that more than 56,000 marchers had passed through metal detectors set up at the start of the route, a larger turnout than expected.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe vigil took the place of a protest rally, called the March of Spring, that Mr. Nemtsov had been organizing for Sunday. It was intended to be a focus for public discontent over stagnant wages and inflation, as well as Russia\u2019s deepening entanglement in Ukraine.\n\nSeveral tiny, mostly obscure Russian political parties and groups were involved in setting up the rally, including the December Fifth Party, the Progress Party and Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s group, the Republican Party of Russia-People\u2019s Freedom Party.\n\nIt was not clear whether that rally would have drawn much of a crowd. Such events in Moscow these days often bring out only the organizers and a few elderly people who show up at any and every protest.\n\nAnd the usual infighting had broken out among the organizers, in this case over the venue. When city officials refused at first to grant a parade permit for the center of Moscow, Mr. Nemtsov took the setback in stride and prepared to hold the rally in the outlying Maryino district. But the Yabloko Party said it would boycott an event there, and held out instead for a central site.\n\nOn Saturday, the city relented and granted the parade permit so that marchers could walk past the place where Mr. Nemtsov was killed. With the march transformed into a vigil, the organizers put aside their squabbling, a possible sign that the shooting could galvanize the Russian opposition to take more effective action.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Medovar, a member of the Yabloko Party, who attended the march as his party\u2019s banners flew over the crowd. \u201cAt least Boris\u2019s murder can unite us, and let us realize that the real enemy is in the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry was asked about Mr. Nemtsov during a Sunday television appearance. \u201cWe are enormously saddened to hear of his murder,\u201d he said on the ABC program \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope the authorities will join the world in producing the credible, transparent investigation necessary to find out who did \u2014 who was behind this and who did it,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs the crowd in Moscow solemnly trudged along, some marchers said they had not planned to attend the March of Spring rally, but wanted to protest the killing of Mr. Nemtsov.\n\n\u201cThey shot somebody in the back, and this is a crime and shouldn\u2019t happen in Russia,\u201d said Olga Dobrovalskaya, a lawyer. \u201cThis really touched people. It\u2019s serious.\u201d\n\nAnother marcher, Marina Nevskaya, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely I would have come to the demonstration in Maryino. But all decent people had to come here. What happened was a personal spit in my face. I don\u2019t want to hide my face from my children.\u201d\n\nThe only known witness to the killing is Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya, a Ukrainian model. Her lawyer said on Sunday that the Russian authorities were not allowing Ms. Duritskaya to return home to Ukraine, though she was not formally being detained.\n\nThe lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, told the RIA news agency that Ms. Duritskaya had rejected police protection but was nonetheless being kept in Moscow under guard. Ilya Yashin, a friend of Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s, told Ukrainian television that Ms. Duritskaya was being held in an apartment in the capital.\n\n\u201cWe think her rights are being violated,\u201d Mr. Prokhorov said. \u201cShe had categorically rejected the program for witness protection, and against her will, she cannot be guarded.\u201d\n\nSome of the marchers on Sunday carried placards suggesting frustration with the way state media outlets vilify the opposition and its leaders. \u201cHate doesn\u2019t build, hate doesn\u2019t cure, hate doesn\u2019t teach, hate kills,\u201d one sign said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter looping past the domes of St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral, the march continued past the sidewalk where Mr. Nemtsov was walking when he was killed. One by one, the mourners laid their bouquets on the pavement, forming what soon became large heaps of flowers."}
