{"title": "Spain Looks to Seize Catalonia Radio and TV as Crisis Mounts", "authors": ["Raphael Minder"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/europe/the-catalonia-crisis-has-not-divided-spain-just-its-media.html", "body": "Among those measures, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy wants to guarantee \u201ctruthful, objective and balanced\u201d coverage in Catalonia.\n\nSuch a media takeover would be a direct strike at Catalan institutions that have been instrumental in promoting a separate culture and language. It would also put the Spanish government on a path toward reducing media freedom in ways that worry many Spaniards, even beyond Catalonia.\n\nBut the prospect has left Catalan citizens and journalists especially anxious. Not least among them is Vicent Sanchis, the general manager of TV3, who said it would return Spain to \u201ca dark period,\u201d when the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco censored information.\n\n\u201cWhen a government says that it will take charge of a television station, I know that this is something very serious,\u201d said Mr. Sanchis, who wrote his doctoral thesis about Franco\u2019s censorship.\n\nSince last weekend, the Catalan broadcaster has received messages of solidarity from the staff committees of rival television stations, including Spanish national television, where some employees have been openly criticizing their own coverage of the conflict.\n\nIgnacio Escolar, the editor of eldiario.es, a Madrid-based online publication, wrote that TV3 \u201cisn\u2019t my model of public television,\u201d but that he was shocked by what he described as the cynicism of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government in demanding \u201ctruthful\u201d coverage.\n\nSpain\u2019s national television station, which is led by a central government appointee, runs news bulletins that have become \u201cobscenely manipulated,\u201d Mr. Escolar claimed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe divergent story lines have sown bitterness all around, and extraordinarily harsh characterizations and criticism from each side.\n\nLast month, a group of far-right protesters stood outside the studio of Catalunya Radio during the morning show of M\u00f2nica Terribas, the station\u2019s most famous presenter.\n\nThey shouted insults and displayed a banner that accused her of leading Catalans toward independence just as a Rwandan radio station persuaded Hutus to kill Tutsis before the 1994 genocide.\n\n\u201cSomebody who compares us to the radio in Rwanda clearly hasn\u2019t thought properly about what that means,\u201d said Ms. Terribas in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cIt breaks my heart to hear people talk about us like monsters who manipulate brains.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps the outlet with the most at stake for Catalans is TV3, which was begun in 1983 as an ambitious regional television project that Catalonia\u2019s leader at the time, Jordi Pujol, used to reinstall the Catalan language, which was banned under Franco\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nSince then, TV3 has spawned a generation of Catalan producers who built their own media companies, in both Catalonia and the rest of Spain.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cTV3 was a decisive element in the construction of the new Catalan identity and society that Pujol wanted, but it also became part of a powerful system of clientelism,\u201d said Josep Maria Mart\u00ed Font, a Catalan journalist and former foreign correspondent for the newspaper El Pa\u00eds.\n\nAntonio Garc\u00eda Ferreras, who runs a politics show on La Sexta, a Madrid-based television channel, argued that Catalonia\u2019s independence movement had been \u201clight years ahead\u201d of its opponents, in terms of promoting its separatist project on every possible platform.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe same ideology has been sold in every clever way possible, including on TV3\u2019s children and food shows,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Ferreras claimed. \u201cI think the independence movement is perhaps now a victim of its communications success, having made people really believe that independence could soon become a reality.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She recently choked back tears on live television while arguing with a Catalan mayor about whether Spanish police officers should be stationed in her town.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThese are extreme circumstances when you\u2019re giving opinions about an issue that affects your family and those you love,\u201d Ms. Griso said. \u201cFrom the media coverage, it often now looks as if we\u2019re already living in different states, but real life is a lot more complicated than that.\u201d\n\nMr. Mart\u00ed Font, the former El Pa\u00eds journalist, noted that the gap in the narrative was \u201cgalactic\u201d on social media, where several videos have gone viral showing Spanish police officers and officials either celebrating and insulting Catalans or receiving abuse from them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe forecast that Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government would use Article 155 to squeeze the Catalan broadcaster financially rather than risk the controversial removal of key staff members.\n\n\u201cMoney talks and it\u2019s easier to turn off the tap to change an editorial line rather than enforce censorship, as we\u2019ve seen with the problems of some newspapers dealing with their debt holders,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Sanchis, the general manager of TV3, acknowledged that his company could not survive without public money. The Catalan government pays 230 million euros, or about $272 million, of TV3\u2019s annual \u20ac300 million budget.\n\nMadrid has already used the stick to force Catalan media into line.\n\nLast month, it warned that it would prosecute media companies that advertised the independence referendum. Ara, a Catalan newspaper that is committed to holding an independence referendum, heeded the warning.\n\n\u201cSome readers were unhappy, but we took this decision not only to protect our newspaper but also to stay sound and alive now,\u201d said Salvador Garcia Ruiz, Ara\u2019s chief executive.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, L\u00eddia Heredia drove home late, after spending 12 hours at her TV3 television station, presenting her morning show and then attending an afternoon newsroom meeting where executives discussed Article 155 with their anguished staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known that I\u2019m in a job with high responsibility as well as pressure, but the situation now feels surreal,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about who we will have to obey or not,\u201d she added. \u201cIt might sound strange, but I always assumed that journalism was about questioning anybody giving orders, to get closer to the reality.\u201d"}
