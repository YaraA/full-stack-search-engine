Mr. Hollande\u2019s official partner, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, was scheduled to accompany him in her role as de facto first lady, but now the visit seems likely to attract considerable attention for his eventual choice of, or lack of, a traveling companion.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always hated when politics turned into a spectacle, and now he finds himself right in the middle of one,\u201d Julien Dray, a prominent Socialist, said in an interview. \u201cThe question is how he will handle it over the long term. If this becomes vaudeville, it could damage his presidency.\u201d\n\nMr. Hollande, 59, has had little respite since a magazine, Closer, caught him meeting at an apartment around the corner from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace with Julie Gayet, a 41-year-old film actress who has played roles as varied as a Foreign Ministry official, a hairdresser and an addict, with nude scenes. The magazine published pictures of him arriving for his trysts on a scooter, wearing a helmet with the visor down, but apparently recognizable by his sensible black lace-up shoes.\n\nMembers of the French public at first took the revelations in their usual sexually sophisticated stride, but not Ms. Trierweiler. People who know her well said she was so devastated by the news that she checked herself into a hospital.\n\nMr. Hollande visited only once during her eight-day stay. Since leaving the hospital over the weekend (and thanking supporters via Twitter for their good wishes), she has been resting at La Lanterne, the presidential getaway at Versailles. Paris Match, where Ms. Trierweiler has remained employed as a journalist even while serving as Mr. Hollande\u2019s official consort, reported on its website that the president had asked her for more time.\n\nMr. Hollande said Monday in a news conference in the Netherlands that Ms. Trierweiler was \u201cgetting better,\u201d but he did not respond to the question of whether she was France\u2019s first lady, according to reports by news services.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf he does leave her, it will be his second high-profile breakup in seven years, after the end of his 25-year relationship with S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, a Socialist Party presidential candidate in 2007 and the mother of their four children.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Hollande\u2019s personal drama was playing out over the past two weeks as he was making one of the most substantive decisions of his term so far, proposing to cut corporate taxes and reduce public spending, moves that unnerved the left wing of his Socialist Party but also drew plaudits from the business world.\n\nThe confluence of the two story lines made Mr. Hollande, who had been caricatured as wobbly as a popular French custard, into a more complex figure.\n\nTo his supporters, this is the start of a new chapter for Mr. Hollande in which he is emerging as a more mature and pragmatic leader who may be freed from what had become a complicated relationship with Ms. Trierweiler.\n\nThey are banking on the assumption that what would be a media circus to an American president will be treated as a sideshow by the French, and that the story will die down.\n\n\u201cThere is a new Hollande, more in harmony with himself,\u201d said one of his close friends.\n\nMuch will depend on what happens in the coming weeks, especially whether Ms. Trierweiler speaks publicly. As Mr. Hollande toured his political constituency of Tulle in central France over the weekend, he was trailed by 90 reporters, almost all French. He declined to answer the few questions that were posed about his personal life.\n\nBut more than his predecessors in the pre-Twitter era, who could count on journalists to keep most private behavior by public officials out of the limelight, Mr. Hollande now finds himself operating in a climate of more intensive and intrusive scrutiny.\n\nPerhaps more worrisome for him is that potentially his support among women could erode.\n\n\u201cThis makes the French look like idiots,\u201d said Arlette da Rocha, who runs the restaurant Le Pressoir in Tulle, where Mr. Hollande started his political career. \u201cHe has to tell the truth. This unconventional behavior in his private life doesn\u2019t give a clean image of the president.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Hollande long seems to have assumed that he could live by his own rules.\n\nAs leader of the Socialist Party, he campaigned for Ms. Royal when she ran for president in 2007. Both of them hid the fact that he had already left her for Ms. Trierweiler. French journalists who knew about the breakup did not write about it until Ms. Royal announced it after the election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe who has betrayed will betray,\u201d Ms. Royal said afterward.\n\nMr. Hollande has never been the marrying kind \u2014 a rarity for high-ranking politicians, although not for many French couples. Not that Ms. Royal was unwilling to tie the knot. Asked about marriage in a joint television interview in 2006 during the prelude to her presidential campaign, she replied mischievously: \u201cWe love each other, so I\u2019m expecting him to propose. Fran\u00e7ois, do you want to marry me?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Mr. Hollande and his aides depicted it as an example of a modern partnership rather than a conflict of interest. She was installed as the de facto first lady with offices in the east wing of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, a staff of four and a monthly budget of about $27,000.\n\nEarly in his presidency, he wanted the freedom to move in and out of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace as he pleased. In \u201cSo Far, Everything\u2019s Going Badly,\u201d a new book on the Hollande presidency, the author, C\u00e9cile Amar, said that shortly after Mr. Hollande was elected, he asked members of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e staff, \u201cHow do I get out without people seeing me?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nConcerned that he might try to escape the \u00c9lys\u00e9e on his motor scooter, his aides sold it, Ms. Amar wrote.\n\nHe took the high-speed train to a European summit meeting in Brussels against the wishes of his security staff, and insisted on living mostly in the apartment he shares with Ms. Trierweiler \u2014 with large exposed bay windows \u2014 which had to be secured.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe quickly made some concessions: He stopped taking trains and abandoned his pledge that his motorcade would stop at red lights like ordinary motorists (an obvious security risk).\n\nBut he still believes he knows best about his security. \u201cI go around when and where I want as I want,\u201d he said at his news conference last week.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen friends and political colleagues suggest that Mr. Hollande often deflects deeper questions about his character.\n\n\u201cHe is very difficult to read,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Rebsamen, a close friend, the mayor of Dijon and a member of the Senate, in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s very affable, bubbly, lively, with a quick mind and great intelligence. But he\u2019s also a very closed person. The true Hollande has revealed himself in the past few days. He\u2019s 100 percent politics. Nothing comes before that. He loves it. He is married to politics.\u201d\n\nPeople describe him as having a good sense of humor, being a good listener and making shrewd political judgments. But these traits alone do not fully capture him.\n\nMr. Hollande once confessed his unwillingness or inability to reveal himself. \u201cYou ask me who I am,\u201d he said in a news conference last May, replying to a narrow question about his political ideology in broader terms. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible question.\u201d", "summary": "Already weighed down by historically low support in the polls, he also faces the challenge of keeping the affair from undercutting his ability to push through an ambitious new agenda aimed at restoring France\u2019s fading global competitiveness and moving his Socialist Party to the center.Mr. Hollande\u2019s official partner, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, was scheduled to accompany him in her role as de facto first lady, but now the visit seems likely to attract considerable attention for his eventual choice of, or lack of, a traveling companion.Mr. Hollande, 59, has had little respite since a magazine, Closer, caught him meeting at an apartment around the corner from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace with Julie Gayet, a 41-year-old film actress who has played roles as varied as a Foreign Ministry official, a hairdresser and an addict, with nude scenes.Mr. Hollande\u2019s personal drama was playing out over the past two weeks as he was making one of the most substantive decisions of his term so far, proposing to cut corporate taxes and reduce public spending, moves that unnerved the left wing of his Socialist Party but also drew plaudits from the business world.But more than his predecessors in the pre-Twitter era, who could count on journalists to keep most private behavior by public officials out of the limelight, Mr. Hollande now finds himself operating in a climate of more intensive and intrusive scrutiny."}
