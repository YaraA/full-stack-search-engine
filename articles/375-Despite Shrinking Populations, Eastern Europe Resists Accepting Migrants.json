I have fewer and fewer citizens, like many medium-sized cities in Poland.\u201d\n\nYet officials point out that several factors prevent the migrants from solving the demographic crisis and explain the region\u2019s resistance to welcoming them.\n\nFor one thing, political leaders argue that it makes no sense to force migrants who wish to live in Germany or other more prosperous nations to settle in the financially hobbled East.\n\nThey will simply pick up and move to where they wanted to be in the first place, said Robert Fico, Slovakia\u2019s prime minister.\n\nAt the same time, residents of the Eastern nations have proved unwilling to welcome migrants, especially those of a different faith, to a region whose historical memory includes battles to throw off Muslim occupation.\n\nHungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, speaks of his country providing a bulwark between Christian Europe and the Islamic world.\n\nFinally, as many migrants themselves point out, it is not merely safety and financial prospects that they seek, but life in a more open and tolerant society.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo the same forces that are driving thousands of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to Western Europe are pushing the new refugees in the same direction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI can tell you why people leave,\u201d said Evgenia Peeva, 29, who returned to Bulgaria after graduating from Harvard to start Teach for Bulgaria, an NGO modeled on Teach for America. \u201cPeople in general are just frustrated with the political situation. They cannot rely on the judicial system. Their leaders lack any sort of political vision. They have been waiting since 1989, and they are tired of waiting for this change to happen.\u201d\n\nIn 1990, just after the fall of Communism, Bulgaria had about nine million citizens, making it slightly bigger than Sweden and Austria. Today, the official population is 7.2 million, much smaller than Sweden or Austria, and projections are that it will lose 12 percent of its population by 2030 and 28 percent by 2050.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Both he and his wife, a lawyer, earned good salaries, by Sofia standards, and they had a comfortable life.\n\n\u201cBut we realized that the new dresses and the new cars are not everything we need,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we will have a chance to live in a normal country with a normal life.\u201d\n\nMagdalena Kostova is director of Bulgaria\u2019s Demographic and Social Statistics Directorate. Between the two most recent censuses \u2014 in 2001 and 2011 \u2014 Bulgaria\u2019s population fell by 564,000, she said. About two-thirds was because of the very low birthrate, but the remainder was pure emigration.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThese days, close to 80 percent of the medical class leaves after graduation,\u201d said Ruslan Stefanov, an analyst for the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia. \u201cPeople feel that life is too unpredictable here.\u201d\n\nThe absence of so many young people may provide a void that immigrants could fill, but it also provides a warning sign to the migrants that they may need to follow the Bulgarian \u00e9migr\u00e9s to the west to live in the kind of open societies they desire.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBulgaria is my homeland \u2014 I want to live here,\u201d said Stefaniya Boneva, 25, a medical student in Germany, while sitting in an outdoor coffee shop near the center of Sofia. \u201cBut something would have to change very drastically for me to come back here. It is probably just an idealistic dream.\u201d\n\nAnd the families left behind \u2014 many of whom remain dependent on money from relatives abroad \u2014 are not terribly eager to trade in their vanished sons and daughters for an unknown community of immigrant strangers.\n\nWhat is needed, Mr. Smolar said, is more calm discussion and less political opportunism over what is clearly an explosive issue in the region.\n\n\u201cThe idea of suddenly meeting the \u2018other,\u2019 someone from a different culture, a different religion, a different physical appearance, is for people here quite naturally a cause for fear, maybe even panic,\u201d Mr. Smolar said.\n\n\u201cNormally,\u201d he added, \u201csuch a change should be preceded by laborious national discussions that would allow people to get used to the fact that they are going to have ethnic minorities living alongside them.\u201d\n\nBut instead of such national discussions, there has been a wave of political opportunism, he said.\n\n\u201cMany cynical politicians prefer to play on people\u2019s fears to their own advantage,\u201d Mr. Smolar said. \u201cUnfortunately, scaremongering does help boost the ratings.\u201d\n\nStoyan Dodnikov was 6 when his mother moved to Chalkida, a small city north of Athens, where she cleans houses and sends the bulk of her earnings back home to the small village of Patalenitsa. He is 13 now.\n\nHe lives with his grandparents in a compound off a dusty square near the village center. \u201cWe are getting by,\u201d said his grandmother, Petrunka Yankova, 52.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSitting in the shade of a grape arbor in his backyard, thick with vegetable plants and alive with the hum of insects, Stoyan outlined his future. Unlike many, he hopes to stay in Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cMy plan is to start my own business,\u201d he said. \u201cI have many ideas and I think I can make them work.\u201d\n\nFor Bulgaria to prosper, he said, it needs more business innovation. Only then can it become a country where mothers do not need to leave their sons behind to seek work in a distant country.\n\n\u201cTo tell the real truth,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is my aim.\u201d", "summary": "Yet anti-migrant sentiment runs strong here and elsewhere in a region worried that the wave of people pouring into Europe from the Middle East, Afghanistan and elsewhere will overwhelm their fragile economies and weaken their national cultures. \u201cYou would be hard pressed to meet someone in the region who does not have at least one member of their immediate or extended family living abroad,\u201d said Sarah Garding, a researcher at the University of Oxford who has focused on migration in Eastern Europe.
