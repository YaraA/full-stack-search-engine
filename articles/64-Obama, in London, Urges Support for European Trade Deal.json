But he eagerly seized on a question about the deal from a young woman in the forum on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIf we are able to get this deal done, it is estimated that it will create millions of jobs and billions of dollars in benefits on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d the president said.\n\nHe also joked that it might finally mean that light sockets in all European nations and the United States would finally be the same.\n\n\u201cThose light sockets are really irritating,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trade question was one of 10 that Mr. Obama took from the audience at the Royal Horticultural Halls.
