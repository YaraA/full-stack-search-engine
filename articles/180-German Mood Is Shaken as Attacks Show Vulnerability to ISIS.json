{"title": "German Mood Is Shaken as Attacks Show Vulnerability to ISIS", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/world/europe/germany-attacks-terrorism-anxiety.html", "body": "It is not clear that is the case any longer.\n\n\u201cIt all appeared to be going pretty well for Merkel, but the situation has changed dramatically in 10 days between the Nice attack and Sunday\u2019s suicide bomber in Ansbach,\u201d the daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung wrote, referring to a rampage that killed 84 in Nice, France. \u201cThe chancellor must once again fear that she will be punished by voters.\u201d\n\nSensing Germans\u2019 insecurity, Ms. Merkel has shifted to a more forceful tone. \u201cWe will resolve this and do everything possible to protect the safety and freedom of all people in Germany,\u201d she said on Saturday.\n\nBut the statement \u2014 coming more than 17 hours after President Obama had offered his condolences for the Munich attack \u2014 did little, it seemed, to blunt a wave of criticism that she and her administration had failed to get a handle on the refugee situation and the potential problems it had invited into the country.\n\nOn social media, the hashtag #Merkelschweigt, or \u201cMerkel stays silent,\u201d quickly resurfaced \u2014 it was first used to denounce her belated reaction to the authorities\u2019 treatment of refugees on the Hungarian-Serbian border last summer.\n\nThe recent attacks (and Ms. Merkel\u2019s seeming absence; she has been on vacation) have left Germans questioning the state\u2019s ability to protect them and whether their generosity to the refugees has been misplaced.\n\nThe perpetrators of the two attacks that appeared linked to or inspired by the Islamic State had entered Germany as migrants and had been living off the benefits funded by German taxpayers, the authorities said.\n\n\u201cWhat has been shaken is the attitude about refugees,\u201d Volker Stanzel, a senior adviser at the European Council on Foreign Relations, noted in an assessment of the security situation in Germany. \u201cYou have a nest of violence in these refugee camps in large parts of public perception. Now suddenly they seem like an imminent danger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Merkel told Parliament in September, as thousands of Germans thronged to train and bus stations bearing gifts and food for thousands of weary immigrants, that the country could benefit from the influx of humanity, \u201cif we do this well.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cthis,\u201d she meant the process of integration the country has in the meantime set down in law. But from the outset, security officials warned that they had no way of knowing who had entered the country.\n\nThe border police, overwhelmed by the sheer number of arrivals, could not properly screen the migrants, and many came without passports or official documents.\n\nOfficials have had a hard time deporting those who have failed to qualify for asylum once they are here, under a system that allows those whose applications are rejected to appeal in court.\n\nConsequently, someone like the 17-year-old refugee who carried out the train attack near W\u00fcrzburg, which left five people wounded, was able to lie about his identity, the authorities now say, and remain in the country. His name has not been made public.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

After a strong showing in state elections in the spring, the party has hovered around 20 percent in recent polls before an election on Sept. 4 in Ms. Merkel\u2019s home state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.\n\n\u201cThe general political climate in Germany does not look better after the horror series in Bavaria,\u201d wrote the Neue Westf\u00e4lische newspaper in an editorial on Tuesday, which went on to voice concern that the attacks would strengthen Alternative for Germany, known by its German initials, AfD.\n\n\u201cIt can already be assumed that through the series of imported hate, more people will flock to the AfD and the chancellor\u2019s phrase, \u2018We can do this,\u2019 will blow up in her face,\u201d the paper wrote.\n\nHorst Seehofer, the Bavarian governor and head of the Bavarian sister party of Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, had criticized the chancellor\u2019s immigration policy for months, calling for caps on the number of migrants taken in and more stringent enforcement of deportation laws. Last month, the two reached an agreement at a summit meeting of their parties in Potsdam.\n\nThis week, that agreement appeared on the verge of crumbling. At a meeting of members of his Christian Social Union\u2019s state lawmakers on Tuesday, Mr. Seehofer pledged to do everything possible to ensure the safety of people in Bavaria, even at the cost of unity within the conservative bloc.\n\n\u201cLevelheadedness is important, but it does not supersede the need for protection of the state,\u201d he said, in a nod to urgings by the chancellor and her interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, to remain calm. \u201cI am now no longer willing, simply in the name of keeping the peace, to not handle things as they must be handled in a country governed by the rule of the law.\u201d", "summary": "But the statement \u2014 coming more than 17 hours after President Obama had offered his condolences for the Munich attack \u2014 did little, it seemed, to blunt a wave of criticism that she and her administration had failed to get a handle on the refugee situation and the potential problems it had invited into the country.
