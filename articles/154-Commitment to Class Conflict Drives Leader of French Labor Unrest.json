Mr. Martinez, those familiar with him and his union say, has a different vision, shaped by decades of close ties between his union and the French Communist Party, of which he was a longtime member.\n\nThe Communist Party and Mr. Martinez share a view of class struggle and unending worker exploitation, according to several experts on French unions. Mr. Martinez, a Renault car factory worker, declined to be interviewed.\n\n\u201cHe agrees that class struggle is the watchword of history, and that workers are necessarily in combat against bosses,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Mouriaux, a leading historian of the French union movement. In Mr. Martinez\u2019s view, he added, between bosses and workers \u201cthere can be compromises, but no definitive agreements.\u201d\n\nThree weeks ago, Mr. Martinez\u2019s workers went on strike to block the printing of France\u2019s national newspapers for a day after newspapers refused to publish a commentary he had written. The Communist newspaper L\u2019Humanit\u00e9 was the only one to print it.\n\n\u201cPhilippe Martinez, the man who wants to bring France to its knees,\u201d read a recent headline in the right-leaning newspaper Le Figaro. An article in the left-center newspaper Le Monde called him \u201cthe Lider Maximo of the protest movement.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Martinez angrily denied that the protest had been connected to the violence at the march through Paris, which left the Boulevard du Montparnasse, a main artery of the city\u2019s Left Bank, looking like a war zone.\n\n\u201cThe hooligans are there to discredit our movement,\u201d he told journalists in the courtyard of the Labor Ministry, vowing to continue the marches until the government gives up its labor law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut despite Mr. Martinez\u2019s belated disavowals, violence, including serious injuries, has been a constant feature of his union\u2019s protests over the past few months.\n\nParis\u2019s police prefect has released photos of union members ripping up paving stones to be used as projectiles. Mr. Martinez said they had simply been defending themselves.\n\nPhoto\n\nShocked by the smashed windows at the children\u2019s hospital, Mr. Hollande said a ban on future demonstrations was possible, provoking outrage among some members his own Socialist Party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for us now to back down from our days of mobilization,\u201d Mr. Martinez told reporters on Friday after a fruitless meeting with the labor minister to end the standoff. \u201cFor three months, the government has been counting on us to lose steam. It\u2019s been a bad bet.\u201d\n\nMr. Hollande\u2019s government is equally unlikely to back down. It is pinning its hopes of denting France\u2019s chronically high unemployment on a law that would only slightly relax negotiating conditions between workers and management.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The law would also define more precisely how companies could lay off workers \u2014 currently an arduous process in a country where workers are highly protected.\n\nBut the part of the proposal that most infuriates C.G.T. and a few other unions would allow labor agreements negotiated by individual companies \u2014 over such issues as hours worked, paid holidays and bonuses \u2014 to take precedence over agreements negotiated at the occupational sector level.\n\nThat change would weaken the power of unions such as C.G.T., and it has made Mr. Martinez see red. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to respect the hierarchy of norms,\u201d he told reporters on Friday, while leaving the door slightly open to possible exceptions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet with each new burst of violence in the streets, the government is increasingly dismissive of Mr. Martinez and his motives. Some government officials say that the violence will backfire and put the French on the side of the labor law, and that Mr. Martinez is using the violence to shore up his base.\n\nIf so, the union leader is doing a good job. France has among the lowest rates of unionization in Europe, and C.G.T., which represents train workers, metalworkers, public sector workers, miners and others, has been losing members for years. Between 1975 and 1993, it lost nearly two-thirds of its members, and now stands at about 686,000.\n\nToday it is made up of mainly hard-core militants, analysts say. The old-fashioned language of class struggle was much in evidence among the crowds at Tuesday\u2019s march, underscoring how many of France\u2019s contemporary struggles are rooted in both the language and facts of its history.\n\n\u201cI Am in the Class Struggle\u201d was a sticker sported by many protesters. \u201cWork Is a Crime Against Humanity,\u201d read another. \u201cVictory in Chaos,\u201d someone had scrawled on a building. \u201cThe Struggle Is About Class Against Class,\u201d read one billboard.\n\nMr. Martinez moves easily among these views. His father fought in the Spanish Civil War in the International Brigades against the fascists, and his mother was a housekeeper.\n\nC.G.T. was founded in 1895, and its \u201cexplicit aim was to bring down the state,\u201d said another historian of French labor, Nick Parsons of Cardiff University in Wales. \u201cIt still has that anticapitalist orientation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a guy who was brought up in that sort of atmosphere,\u201d Dr. Parsons added. \u201cHe\u2019s imbued with that history and culture.\u201d\n\nMr. Martinez has shown a willingness to compromise in negotiations as a metalworker representative in preceding decades, Dr. Parsons noted. But that side is not evident now, with polls showing that most French people are still opposed to the labor law.\n\nThe class struggle continues.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be called the \u2018law on work,\u2019 but the \u2018social dumping law,\u2019\u201d Mr. Martinez yelled during a recent speech at a factory in southern France. \u201cWe\u2019re not close to giving up. The stakes are high \u2014 for today\u2019s workers, for the young, for our country.\u201d", "summary": "For unions, the government\u2019s proposed labor law is another step by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to move France to the center in order to address the challenges of a global economy. \u201cHe agrees that class struggle is the watchword of history, and that workers are necessarily in combat against bosses,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Mouriaux, a leading historian of the French union movement. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for us now to back down from our days of mobilization,\u201d Mr. Martinez told reporters on Friday after a fruitless meeting with the labor minister to end the standoff.
