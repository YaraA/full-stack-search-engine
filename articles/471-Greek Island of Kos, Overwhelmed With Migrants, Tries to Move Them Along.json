{"title": "Greek Island of Kos, Overwhelmed With Migrants, Tries to Move Them Along", "authors": ["Anemona Hartocollis"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/world/europe/greece-kos-migrants-refugees-syria.html", "body": "Aid workers estimate that there are 6,000 to 7,000 refugees and migrants from countries like Syria staying on Kos, the equivalent of about 20 percent of the island\u2019s normal population. Most of them made the short trip from Turkey, whose coastline is clearly visible across the harbor, by rubber dinghy in the middle of the night.\n\nVideo\n\nMany of them are now camped under palm trees and in the grass of the promenade that lines the main harbor. They hang their clothes on the fences, and some sleep in tents they have purchased. Those who can afford it go to cafes to buy food and to use the bathrooms. In a striking juxtaposition, tourists cycle past on bike paths or sit in cafes overlooking the migrant encampments and the sparkling blue water beyond.\n\nMr. Kiritsis said that Kos had welcomed and cared for the migrants, despite Greece\u2019s economic problems, and that at least so far, tourists seemed to be taking their presence in stride.\n\n\u201cI want to give you the message that the society of Kos is a society of love and solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who receive free food every day. There are establishments \u2014 restaurants, hotels \u2014 that provide hospitality to people who have problems, who don\u2019t have money, without charge.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They said that some men had been able to jump over the walls and bring back food and water, but that women and children had been stuck inside.\n\nThe scene outside the stadium on Thursday was peaceful but still somewhat tense as migrants, mainly men, lined up in the hot sun to be registered. One of them, Elie Alnasser, a chef who had been living in Lebanon, said he had arrived in Kos several days earlier and had been paying 35 euros a night, about $39, for a hotel room while he waited for papers that would allow him to move on.\n\nMr. Alnasser said he hoped to find his way to Sweden or the Netherlands. \u201cI like France a lot,\u201d he said in broken French. \u201cBut I think they don\u2019t allow Syrians.\u201d\n\nMr. Kiritsis, the mayor, said he expected a ship to arrive from the mainland on Friday that could be used to house and feed about 3,000 of the refugees and migrants so they would no longer have to camp outside."}
