{"title": "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, French Presidential Candidate, Is Charged With Embezzlement", "authors": ["Aurelien Breeden"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/world/europe/france-francois-fillon-charged.html", "body": "Since the first revelations, polls have shown Mr. Fillon likely to be eliminated in a first round on April 23. That would leave two candidates outside the major parties, including Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front, to battle it out in the decisive second round on May 7. That unprecedented development, coupled with Ms. Le Pen\u2019s newfound status as a contender against a former economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, has deeply unsettled political life here.\n\nMr. Fillon\u2019s problems were compounded over the weekend by revelations of his alleged extravagant sartorial tastes. Reports, not denied by him, have said nearly 48,500 euros, or about $51,500, has been paid to a tailor since 2012 for fine suits, although it was unclear who made the payments. The newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, which first published the reports, added on Sunday that an anonymous benefactor paid in February for two suits worth about $13,800 for Mr. Fillon, prompting Parliament\u2019s ethics ombudsman to open an inquiry.\n\nThe new charges were expected, but they were announced a day ahead of schedule after Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 leaked the development over Twitter. Mr. Fillon had been summoned by investigative judges for Wednesday, but his lawyer said Tuesday that he had asked that Mr. Fillon meet with them a day earlier to avoid a large news media stakeout.\n\nMr. Fillon read a statement to the judges that was obtained by the newspaper Le Figaro. In it, the newspaper said, Mr. Fillon denied any wrongdoing, as he has done consistently before.\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s job as parliamentary aide was not fictitious, and it is not up to the judicial authority to assess the quality or content of this work,\u201d Mr. Fillon was reported to have said in the statement. \u201cI am asking neither for exemption nor favor, only for respect of the law.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His party, the Republicans, has few good alternatives.\n\nMs. Le Pen and the National Front are also targets of several investigations, but that has not seemed to affect her poll standing.\n\nMr. Fillon experienced a slight reprieve last week, when one of his main rivals on the center-right announced that he would not challenge Mr. Fillon\u2019s candidacy, and the Republicans closed ranks and agreed to continue backing him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of Mr. Fillon\u2019s supporters who had dropped out of his campaign or expressed doubts about his chances have since returned to the fold, including the Union of Democrats and Independents, a centrist party.\n\nMr. Fillon had been trying to steer the news media\u2019s attention away from the corruption allegations and toward his platform of pro-business policies, including lengthening the standard 35-hour workweek and raising the retirement age to 65 from 62.\n\nStill, French journalists seem to find new examples of suspected wrongdoing nearly every day.\n\nOn Monday, for example, Le Parisien reported that the son and daughter Mr. Fillon hired as aides transferred large sums to him during that time, furthering suspicions that their jobs and Ms. Fillon\u2019s were enrichment schemes.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Fillon\u2019s daughter said she was merely repaying money her father had spent on her wedding. Mr. Fillon\u2019s lawyer said the son was repaying rent and \u201cpocket money.\u201d\n\nMr. Fillon\u2019s opponents have been frustrated that the scandal has dominated coverage of the campaign, drowning out all but the best-known candidates, and that Mr. Fillon did not keep his promise to drop out.\n\n\u201cI regret the confiscation of the democratic debate,\u201d J\u00e9r\u00f4me Guedj, a spokesman for the Socialist presidential candidate Beno\u00eet Hamon, said in an interview on BFM TV on Tuesday. \u201cBut the main person responsible for this confiscation is Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, with this obstinacy and failure to respect the word he gave.\u201d"}
