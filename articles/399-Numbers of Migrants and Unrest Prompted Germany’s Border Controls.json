Officials feared the situation could spiral out of control.\n\nAs frustration mounted in Berlin, Munich, Budapest and Brussels, the chancellor did an about-face: After throwing open its borders a week earlier, Germany would reimpose controls on its open borders. Although not unprecedented, the step dealt a blow to European pride in freedom of movement \u2014 and signaled that Germany\u2019s patience was spent.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nSome of the pressure on Ms. Merkel had come from the governor of Bavaria, Horst Seehofer, who complained that she had opened the borders with very little advance notice and that his state was scrambling to accommodate a relentless flow.\n\nMr. Seehofer, the conservative leader of Bavaria\u2019s governing Christian Social Union, is nominally the chancellor\u2019s ally in her center-right bloc. But the two are wildly dissimilar: She is the scientist raised in East Germany who has steered her party to the center, while he presides over the bloc\u2019s deeply traditional Roman Catholics.\n\nHe likes to chide her, and now he feared for public security in Bavaria.\n\nBy midday Saturday, as the authorities in Munich, the Bavarian capital, faced a record number of arrivals, Mr. Reiter, the mayor, warned that the situation was becoming unbearable.\n\n\u201cThis is too much, even for Munich,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep hearing from Berlin that there are talks about a way to distribute refugees, but we are not talking days or weeks, it\u2019s got to happen right now.\u201d\n\nAnger had also reached a boiling point among leaders of other states, which in Germany not only must take in a certain quota of migrants, but are also required to pay for housing and educating them. The governors insisted that the six billion euros ($6.8 billion) Ms. Merkel had so far offered in assistance was woefully inadequate.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was cast as a signal to European partners that even wealthy Germany could not shoulder the burden of accommodating up to 800,000 migrants this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy Monday, Ms. Merkel\u2019s deputy, Sigmar Gabriel, was arguing that in fact the country could face an even greater number of migrants in 2015. \u201cThere are many indications that in this year we will not see 800,000 refugees, as predicted, but a million,\u201d Mr. Gabriel wrote in a letter to members of his center-left Social Democrats.\n\n\u201cGermany is strong and can handle a lot,\u201d Mr. Gabriel wrote. \u201cNevertheless, in the past few days we have experienced how despite our best efforts, our abilities have reached their limits.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the measure on the border had an effect: The flow of migrants into Munich dropped by about half, to 7,000 or so for Sunday, according to the regional government in Upper Bavaria. But the move backed traffic up along two main European highways and several other roads, as the police initiated spot checks on vehicles crossing from Austria to Germany.\n\nCommuters honked and fumed, with many arriving late for work.\n\nReverting to her custom of governing from behind the scenes, Ms. Merkel sent out her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, on Monday to emphasize that controls did not mean the borders had closed, or that Germany would stop providing asylum.\n\n\u201cWe will manage,\u201d Mr. Seibert said, recapping one of the chancellor\u2019s phrases from last week. \u201cNobody said we would manage it all overnight.\u201d\n\nThe decision to reimpose controls on the open borders on which Europe has prided itself for two decades was the second such move recently; Germany temporarily imposed border controls in June, to tighten security for the summit meeting of seven world leaders in Bavaria.\n\nThe depth of consternation over Germany\u2019s actions in recent weeks was clear from Austria\u2019s interior minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, when she arrived Monday in Brussels, where Mr. De Maizi\u00e8re and all their European Union counterparts were trying to reforge a common policy on migration and asylum.\n\nMs. Mikl-Leitner effectively blamed Germany for touching off the migrant chaos. After the international media reported in late August that Germany was offering asylum to any Syrian \u2014 which Berlin insists is not true \u2014 \u201cthousands of people set off, even more strongly,\u201d she said. That helped power the wave of thousands of migrants who got stuck in Hungary very early this month.\n\nThe warm reception for those migrants when they moved into Austria and Germany in turn spurred more to set out from Turkey via Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary toward western Europe, Ms. Mikl-Leitner said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe reckoned that Germany would have to react at some point,\u201d she said Monday as Austria scrambled to enact similar controls, sending 2,200 soldiers to the border to help. \u201cIt was clear to everybody that it could not go on.\u201d", "summary": "Some of the pressure on Ms. Merkel had come from the governor of Bavaria, Horst Seehofer, who complained that she had opened the borders with very little advance notice and that his state was scrambling to accommodate a relentless flow.
