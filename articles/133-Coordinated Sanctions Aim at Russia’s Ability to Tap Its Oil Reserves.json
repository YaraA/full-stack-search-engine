BP, which owns 19.75 percent of Rosneft, just signed a joint venture with the Russian firm in May to search for shale oil in the Volga-Urals region.\n\nEven though BP announced higher quarterly profits on Tuesday, its stock was hammered by the sanctions news, falling 3 percent. BP warned investors bluntly that further sanctions \u201ccould adversely impact our business and strategic objectives in Russia.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDan Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said the new energy measures underscored how much ties had deteriorated. \u201cA year ago, Western collaboration with Russia\u2019s energy sector was one of the bright spots in what had become a dour relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cNo longer.\u201d\n\nThe carefully orchestrated actions on both sides of the Atlantic were intended to demonstrate solidarity in the face of what American and European officials say has been a stark escalation by Russia in the insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Until now, European leaders had resisted the broader sorts of actions they agreed to on Tuesday, and their decision to pursue them reflected increasing alarm that Russia was not only helping separatists in Ukraine but directly involving itself in the fighting.\n\nThey are \u201cmeant as a strong warning,\u201d Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said in a statement on Tuesday that was joined by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission. \u201cDestabilizing Ukraine, or any other Eastern European neighboring state, will bring heavy costs,\u201d the statement said.\n\nPresident Obama said Russia\u2019s economy would continue to suffer until it reversed course. \u201cToday is a reminder that the United States means what it says, and we will rally the international community in standing up for the rights and freedom of people around the world,\u201d he told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Obama said the fact that Europe was now joining the United States in broader measures meant the moves would \u201chave an even bigger bite,\u201d but in response to reporters\u2019 questions, he said it was \u201cnot a new Cold War\u201d between the two countries. He also made clear he was not considering providing arms to Ukraine\u2019s government, as some Republicans have suggested, as it tries to put down the pro-Russian insurgency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are better armed than the separatists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue is, \u2018How do we prevent bloodshed in eastern Ukraine?\u2019 We\u2019re trying to avoid that. And the main tool that we have to influence Russian behavior at this point is the impact that it\u2019s having on its economy.\u201d\n\nThe American and European actions were intended to largely, though not precisely, match each other. The United States cut off three more Russian banks, including the giant VTB Bank, from medium- and long-term capital markets and barred Americans from doing business with the United Shipbuilding Corporation, a large state-owned firm created by Mr. Putin. The Obama administration also formally suspended export credit and development finance to Russia.\n\nThe European Union adopted similar restrictions on capital markets and applied them to Russian state-owned banks. It imposed an embargo on new arms sales to Russia and limited sales of equipment with both civilian and military uses to Russian military buyers. Europe also approved new sanctions against at least three close Putin associates, but did not identify them publicly.\n\nVideo\n\nEuropean governments moved ahead despite concerns that Europe would pay an economic price for confronting the Kremlin more aggressively. While their actions went far beyond any previously taken against Russia over the Ukraine crisis, they were tailored to minimize their own costs. The arms embargo, for instance, applies only to future sales, not to the much-debated delivery by France of Mistral-class helicopter carriers that resemble bigger aircraft carriers. And the energy technology restrictions do not apply to Russian natural gas, on which Europe relies heavily.\n\nThe new sanctions could take effect as soon as Friday, though the necessary legal formalities would most likely to take longer to complete, officials said.\n\nOn Twitter, the president of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaite, praised the decision \u201con a wide range of sanctions on Russia.\u201d But she expressed unease that France would be able to maintain its naval deal with Moscow. \u201cUnfortunately, nothing to stop the deal of Mistral yet,\u201d she wrote. Lithuania is one of five European Union states that are close to or border Russia.\n\nMr. Van Rompuy departed from the usual cautious language of Europe\u2019s declarations by condemning Russia for actions that \u201ccannot be accepted in 21st-century Europe,\u201d including \u201cillegal annexation of territory\u201d \u2014 a reference to Crimea \u2014 \u201cand deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country.\u201d He also cited the \u201canger and frustration\u201d over the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over rebel-held territory on July 17 and \u201cthe delays in providing international access to the site of the air crash, the tampering with the remains of the plane, and the disrespectful handling of the deceased.\u201d\n\nAlthough European commerce with Russia will probably decline because of the sanctions, where the measures are expected to more severely affect Russia are the restrictions on the ability of Russian banks to raise money in Europe and the United States. \u201cThese sanctions can have quite a substantial chilling effect on the Russian economy,\u201d said Adam Slater, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cThat is probably a quite effective way to put pressure on Russia.\u201d\n\nStill, it could take time for the effects to be felt by ordinary Russians, and some analysts expected the Kremlin to shrug them off, at least publicly."}
