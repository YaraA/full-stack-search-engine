Far-right candidates have disparaged Islam, often depicting Muslims as outsiders unwilling to integrate into Dutch culture.\n\nIt is especially jarring for Mr. Aboutaleb, given that he is the mayor of Rotterdam, a fluent Dutch speaker and one of the country\u2019s most popular politicians. Nor is he alone: The speaker of the Dutch Parliament is Muslim.
