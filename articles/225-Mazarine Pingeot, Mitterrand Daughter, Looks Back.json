It was not until 1994 that the story came out, when pictures of her and her father were published in the magazine Paris Match.\n\nLast month, Ms. Pingeot published \u201cBon Petit Soldat,\u201d (\u201cGood Little Soldier\u201d), a diary that includes memories of her childhood as a state secret. It is another attempt, she said, to \u201cunravel\u201d the enigmas of her past, seven years after she published \u201cBouche Cousue\u201d (\u201cSealed Lips\u201d).\n\n\u201cBeing unable to share a secret makes this secret very heavy,\u201d she said in an interview at Julliard, her publisher. \u201cYou protect it rather than protecting yourself.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Pingeot described in her autobiographical books and in interviews how Mr. Mitterrand spent almost every night of his 14 years in office with his daughter and mistress in a secret apartment in the Seventh Arrondissement of Paris, across the river and three miles from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e.\n\nMs. Pingeot spent her childhood surrounded by books, pets and eight bodyguards. She wrote poems and read Flaubert, Balzac and Zola because \u201cliterature goes with loneliness,\u201d and when she got a bicycle, her bodyguards followed her on bicycles, too.\n\nMr. Mitterrand liked \u201cambivalence,\u201d Ms. Pingeot said. It was a different age, one more protective of the private lives of high officials, and, she said, Mr. Mitterrand liked to eat with her at restaurants and stroll with her along the banks of the Seine.\n\nBUT he was careful, too, even suspicious. He ordered his security staff to wiretap those who knew about her existence, including a journalist, Jean-Edern Hallier. He spoke of his daughter to a tiny circle of friends, said Christian Prouteau, Mr. Mitterrand\u2019s chief of security, but sheltered his second family in houses bought with state money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the outside world, Ms. Pingeot was \u201cthe lovely little lie,\u201d as she described herself in \u201cBouche Cousue.\u201d She met Mr. Mitterrand\u2019s official children several days before her father\u2019s funeral, and discovered Jarnac, her father\u2019s native village in southwestern France, after he died in 1996.\n\nAt home, Ms. Pingeot was the cherished only daughter, where she would joke with her father and he would act very unpresidential. \u201cMy father would hide an egg behind his back and say, \u2018Look at me: I\u2019m a hen,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Pingeot said, smiling shyly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Mitterrand first met Anne Pingeot when she was 13, and later looked after her when she moved to Paris from her native Auvergne. The two fell in love when Mr. Mitterrand started his first presidential campaign, around 1963. Ms. Pingeot was then in her early 20s and he was in his late 40s.\n\nWhen Mr. Mitterrand took office in 1981, Ms. Pingeot was 6, and her father refused to change his routine. He came \u201chome\u201d almost every day and sang her a lullaby almost every night. When they spent summer days together in southern France, he would take her hand and they would kiss the trunks of the lime trees, opposite their house. Her life with Mr. Mitterrand was made of rituals, she said. Before going to bed, she would kiss him on the tip of his nose, which was sharp and angular, like hers.\n\nIn 1994, when Paris Match broke the story of the president\u2019s second family, publishing photographs of Mazarine\u2019s frail figure and studious looks, it had the effect of an explosion, she said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMy father called me and said, \u2018Prepare yourself,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIt was ultraviolent. I went from invisibility to exposure, and I felt even more imprisoned.\u201d\n\nHer first public appearance was at her father\u2019s funeral, when Mr. Mitterrand\u2019s wife stood next to her husband\u2019s longtime mistress and took his long-secret daughter in her arms. In a book called \u201cEn Toutes Libert\u00e9s\u201d (\u201cIn All Liberty\u201d), published in 1996, Mrs. Mitterrand, who was famous for her charitable work and died last year, said she had known about the existence of Mazarine long before her husband\u2019s funeral.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a discovery or a drama,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve taken responsibility for it.\u201d\n\nMs. Pingeot, who studied in France\u2019s elite \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, taught philosophy at the University of Aix-Marseille and became a media-savvy author and columnist. She wrote her first book at 24 and later published seven books in seven years, including an essay on Descartes and a novel on infanticide. She worked for the Europe 1 radio network, appeared on several television programs, and has recently been on the cable channel Paris Premi\u00e8re. She also has a Web program sponsored by Starbucks, on which she interviews celebrities.\n\nHer books have stirred some negative reviews and reactions, but she responds to critics by saying that her story \u201cbelongs to France\u201d and that being Mr. Mitterrand\u2019s daughter made her a \u201cscapegoat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTo tell the truth, if Mazarine Pingeot wasn\u2019t Mitterrand\u2019s daughter, we wouldn\u2019t talk about this book,\u201d said a review in Le Figaro of Ms. Pingeot\u2019s 2000 novel, \u201cZeyn ou la Reconqu\u00eate\u201d (\u201cZeyn or the Reconquest\u201d).\n\nTODAY, Ms. Pingeot teaches philosophy at Universit\u00e9 Paris 8 and lives with Mohamed Ulad-Mohand, a French-Moroccan documentary filmmaker. He directed a 1993 documentary called \u201cAn American in Tangiers,\u201d on the American author Paul Bowles. Ms. Pingeot and Mr. Ulad-Mohand have three children: Astor, 7; Tara, 5; and Marie, 2.\n\nShe has never been drawn to politics but publicly backed the successful presidential candidacy of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. She said she regretted that politics had become so professionalized.\n\n\u201cMy father was a humanist who liked history and culture,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would look at things from the big picture.\u201d\n\nIn June, she was invited to Mr. Hollande\u2019s investiture at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace and went there officially for the first time since her father left office in 1995.\n\n\u201cIt was a historic moment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for me, it meant going back to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e without wanting to hide myself.\u201d", "summary": "Last month, Ms. Pingeot published \u201cBon Petit Soldat,\u201d (\u201cGood Little Soldier\u201d), a diary that includes memories of her childhood as a state secret.Ms. Pingeot described in her autobiographical books and in interviews how Mr. Mitterrand spent almost every night of his 14 years in office with his daughter and mistress in a secret apartment in the Seventh Arrondissement of Paris, across the river and three miles from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e.He spoke of his daughter to a tiny circle of friends, said Christian Prouteau, Mr. Mitterrand\u2019s chief of security, but sheltered his second family in houses bought with state money.In 1994, when Paris Match broke the story of the president\u2019s second family, publishing photographs of Mazarine\u2019s frail figure and studious looks, it had the effect of an explosion, she said.In a book called \u201cEn Toutes Libert\u00e9s\u201d (\u201cIn All Liberty\u201d), published in 1996, Mrs. Mitterrand, who was famous for her charitable work and died last year, said she had known about the existence of Mazarine long before her husband\u2019s funeral."}
