And Mr. Macron quickly made clear that he understood the magnitude of the task before him after an often angry campaign.\n\n\u201cIt is my responsibility to hear and protect the most fragile,\u201d he said.\n\nWith nearly 100 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Macron had 66 percent, compared with 34 percent for Ms. Le Pen, according to the official count from the Interior Ministry.\n\nThe outcome was a watershed for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party, the far-right National Front, giving it new legitimacy even though the results showed that the party remains anathema to much of the French electorate for its history of anti-Semitism, racism and Nazi nostalgia.\n\nAs significant for France and for Mr. Macron\u2019s future, nearly 34 percent of eligible voters did not cast a ballot or cast a blank or null one, suggesting that a large number of people could not bring themselves to vote for him. The abstention rate was the highest since 1969.\n\nThat lack of support presaged a difficult road ahead as Mr. Macron tries to build a legislative majority to push through his program. French parliamentary elections are next month. Currently, he has no party in Parliament.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong the odds stacked against Mr. Macron, a former economy minister in the departing Socialist government, are deep doubts about the merits of a market economy.\n\n\u201cWe saw the emergence of very strong anticapitalist forces,\u201d said Gaspard Koenig, the director of the French think tank Generation Libre.\n\n\u201cYou have 50 percent of the electorate that reject the market economy in a very radical way,\u201d Mr. Koenig added. \u201cThus, he must during the next five years convince people that there are alternatives to the destruction of capitalism that can help them.\u201d\n\nThe runoff election was groundbreaking for being a choice between two political outsiders, as well as for its rancor and for an apparent attempt to sway the vote with the hacking of Macron campaign emails, similar to the attack directed at last year\u2019s election in the United States.\n\nVideo\n\nMs. Le Pen, 48, conceded the election not long after polls closed in France, saying voters had chosen \u201ccontinuity,\u201d denying Mr. Macron his outsider status and linking him to the departing Socialists.\n\nThe vote was a record for the National Front and, she said, a mandate for it to become a new \u201cpatriotic and republican alliance\u201d that would be \u201cthe primary opposition force against the new president.\u201d\n\nMs. Le Pen earned 10.6 million votes, close to twice the number her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, received when he ran a losing presidential campaign against Jacques Chirac in 2002. The 34 percent of the vote Ms. Le Pen won was the highest share the French had ever given to her party.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

St\u00e9phane Ravier, a National Front senator and a close adviser to Ms. Le Pen, said the party needed to go further in remaking its identity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe will need to make some changes, do things differently,\u201d he said in an interview as the returns came in. \u201cWe will have to talk about our positions on the euro with more pedagogy. We may also have to change the name of the party.\u201d\n\nIn her concession speech, Ms. Le Pen acknowledged that the party had to \u201cprofoundly\u201d renew itself to become a \u201cnew political force.\u201d\n\nMs. Le Pen clearly failed to persuade enough voters that her party had sufficiently changed. Many of the votes Mr. Macron received on Sunday were no doubt cast less in support of him than in rejection of her. Nearly the entire political establishment spoke out against a Le Pen presidency.", "summary": "\u201cI will do everything I can in the coming five years to make sure you never have a reason to vote for extremism again,\u201d he said later Sunday evening, standing before the glass pyramid in front of the Louvre, once the main residence of France\u2019s kings, as thousands of flag-waving supporters gathered in the courtyard to celebrate.
