{"title": "Britain Tries to Deter Migrants, Even as It Lets More In", "authors": ["Kimiko De Freytas-Tamura"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/world/europe/britain-tries-to-deter-migrants-even-as-it-lets-more-in.html", "body": "Many newcomers encounter meager benefits, tightly controlled living conditions, long waits for processing and a hard-line stance on what justifies asylum.\n\n\u201cBritain has probably become one of the harshest countries for asylum seekers in Europe if we think in terms of criteria like access to territory, refugee recognition rates, the administrative process, available benefits, and conditions of detention and removal,\u201d said Alexander Betts, director of the Refugee Studies Center at Oxford University.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, the government plans more restrictive measures this autumn in a bill aimed at further deterring future migrants. Proposals include cutting benefits for asylum seekers, who now live on the equivalent of about $8 a day. Immigrants found to be working illegally would face six months in prison, and asylum seekers could be immediately deported. Companies hiring them would also be punished.\n\nBritain has also decided not to adopt new European Union directives on the reception and protection of asylum seekers, which impose time limits on detention and grant them access to jobs.\n\nThe high bar for securing asylum has come as a shock to some, like Huruy, 29, a former soldier from Eritrea who is appealing his denial. \u201cI was angry,\u201d he said at a center to aid asylum seekers in Sheffield.\n\nLike others interviewed, Huruy uses an alias because he fears deportation, though asylum seekers are allowed to stay while their cases are under appeal.\n\nA thin man with a deep crescent-shaped scar between his eyebrows, Huruy said he had been repeatedly warned of the dangers he would face fleeing to Britain: Eritrean border guards would kill him; smugglers would steal his money and leave him to die in the Sahara. If he made it that far, Islamic State militants in Libya would \u201cchop his head off like a chicken,\u201d or he would drown in the Mediterranean.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe managed to survive those hazards across five countries, one desert and two seas, and was rescued after the Europe-bound cargo ship that carried him in December capsized.\n\nBut he was not prepared to be refused asylum by the country where he sought refuge, he said.\n\nHe said he pleaded with the officers who found him hidden in a truck entering Britain through the Channel Tunnel that he was not an economic migrant, and that Eritrea, one of the world\u2019s most secretive and repressive countries, was far from safe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just escaped from a very, very difficult situation,\u201d Huruy said.\n\nHis circumstances here as he pursues his case are hardly comfortable. He walked an hour to the asylum aid center because he could not afford the bus fare, and lives in asylum housing outside Sheffield. He wants to work, but cannot under British rules that discourage newcomers arriving merely for jobs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said of his free time.\n\nThe idea that asylum seekers \u201care sitting in refugee camps with a calculator in their hands, working out the benefits they\u2019ll get if they choose to go to one destination rather than another, is far-fetched,\u201d Mr. Betts said.\n\nYet according to a recent poll published by the BBC, a majority of the public were in favor of Britain\u2019s taking in fewer refugees, or at least maintaining current acceptance rates.\n\nLast year, Britain granted refugee status to 14,605 applicants, fewer than a third of the number granted by Germany and half of that granted by Sweden, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency. France and Italy each granted refugee status to around 20,630 asylum seekers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

France provides \u20ac343.50 and Belgium \u20ac276. In Sweden, an adult asylum seeker receives 2,130 krona, or about $252, a month, but can also seek work.\n\nIn Britain, asylum seekers face immediate deportation if they seek work, to ensure migrants do not arrive for economic reasons, the Home Office said. In Germany and Austria, asylum seekers must wait three months before seeking employment, while in France, they can get temporary work permits.\n\nBritain is the only European Union country where asylum seekers can be detained for an unlimited period while their applications are processed, Mr. Mouzourakis said. According to Home Office statistics, 40 percent of asylum seekers spend more than a month in detention.\n\nPrivate contractors run seven of Britain\u2019s 11 immigration detention centers, where migrants are under lock and key. In Germany, there are no special detention centers for asylum seekers, while France does not detain anyone for the purpose of examining a claim and limits detention to 45 days. Detention is not widespread in Sweden, but it has been used more in recent months.\n\nAdvocates for asylum seekers in Britain said the system was a challenge. Migrants file asylum claims in Croydon, near central London, and are typically detained in immigration removal centers while their right to entry is assessed. Some migrants are given housing, generally in the north, in towns like Sheffield.\n\nHuruy and another Eritrean, Daniel, 23, live with others from Afghanistan and Iraq, each on his \u00a35.28 a day.\n\nIsaac, 52, from Nigeria, said he had saved for seven weeks to buy a shirt. \u201cThe whole asylum system is set up to make you so frustrated and so angry that you give up and you want to leave,\u201d he said.\n\nSince 2012, housing has been provided through the security companies G4S, Serco and Clearel on government contracts, though last year the government auditors concluded that they lacked the required experience and arranged for \u201cunacceptably poor\u201d housing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore privatization, in 2011, a parliamentary inquiry reported on families living in \u201cpoorly maintained, overcrowded accommodation infested with mice, cockroaches and other pests, rotting floorboards and locked windows.\u201d\n\nJohn Grayson, an activist based in Sheffield, said of migrants, \u201cThey\u2019ve gone through a horrendous journey, and these conditions exacerbate their trauma.\u201d\n\nA G4S spokesman, Nigel Fairbrass, said the parliamentary reports were outdated. He said any evidence that British standards \u201care not being met would be taken very seriously by both G4S and the Home Office.\u201d", "summary": "Britain has also decided not to adopt new European Union directives on the reception and protection of asylum seekers, which impose time limits on detention and grant them access to jobs.
