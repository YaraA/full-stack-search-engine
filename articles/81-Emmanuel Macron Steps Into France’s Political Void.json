{"title": "Emmanuel Macron Steps Into France\u2019s Political Void", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-france.html?action=click&contentCollection=Europe&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article", "body": "Despite Ms. Le Pen\u2019s best efforts to remake her party, the National Front has traditionally been too toxic for a majority of French to embrace. So even though she currently leads in the polls, hardly anyone expects her to make it through the second round of the country\u2019s two-stage voting this spring to become president.\n\nYet Mr. Macron has never been elected to anything. He served two largely unsuccessful years directing France\u2019s vast but sluggish economy, with scant accomplishment in his wake. He is not a member of either major party, or of any party, and is disliked by many of the Socialists in whose government he served. He claims to transcend the parties.\n\nWhile he has pushed a message that includes doses from left, right and center \u2014 maintain France\u2019s social protections, keep the country in the European Union and lighten the burden on business \u2014 it is a strategy that has also made him the candidate offering something just about everyone can hate.\n\nOr, perhaps more damning in France, it has risked making him into a mannequin candidate who stands for nothing.\n\n\u201cEmmanuel Macron doesn\u2019t want to define himself, and it\u2019s becoming a problem,\u201d Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis, a Socialist heavyweight and the party\u2019s secretary, said recently. \u201cMeanwhile, it\u2019s all a little bit hollow.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Macron started his campaign, snickers about his new movement\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cEn Marche,\u201d or, \u201cOn Our Way\u201d \u2014 all but drowned out whatever message the young minister was trying to project. \u201cOn our way \u2014 to what?\u201d the skeptics asked.\n\nThat questions remains largely unanswered even as he now gains traction.\n\nA small stream of Socialist members of Parliament have signed on, despite threats of excommunication from the party, as well as some business and political leaders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Macron is married to his former high school drama teacher \u2014 this fascinates his countrymen \u2014 who is 24 years his senior, and he caused a scandal in his provincial hometown, Amiens, by wooing her. He is a former investment banker with Rothschild & Company, low on the list of most admired professions.\n\nYet Mr. Macron and his wife, Brigitte, have been on the cover of Paris Match four times in the last year. The glossy magazine has published photographs of the minister giving a bottle to his wife\u2019s grandchildren.\n\nOn Monday, he brought the gay rumors into the open, joking about them in a speech, to the surprise of French media: \u201cIt\u2019s disagreeable for Brigitte,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cShe\u2019s asking how I pull this off, physically. She shares my life from morning to night \u2014 and I\u2019ve never paid her for it,\u201d he added, slyly evoking the nepotism scandal engulfing Mr. Fillon for having kept his wife on the public payroll for no detectable work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In Lyon last weekend 8,000 people packed into the sports stadium to hear him, forcing thousands more out on to the grounds to watch Mr. Macron on giant screens.\n\nHe spoke for nearly two hours, his face turned up in a kind of rapture, frequently addressing the crowd as his friends.\n\nThere were many vague promises of hope and unity, and above all, delight in the huge crowd that had come out. \u201cYour presence, this wall of presences around me, this is living proof that we really are here,\u201d Mr. Macron said, beaming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a demonstration of desire,\u201d he told the crowd, \u201cthe desire to picture a new future,\u201d he continued, in a literary language he says was imbibed early during a studious childhood, in his new campaign book \u2014 commentators have mocked the grandeur of the title \u2014 \u201cRevolution.\u201d\n\nIn his speech Mr. Macron claimed the mantle of left, right, center, Charles de Gaulle, and other factions, as well as writers like \u00c9mile Zola, Charles P\u00e9guy and Ren\u00e9 Char, all under the floating aegis of a \u201cwill to assemble\u201d and \u201creconciliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Gaullists,\u201d he said, \u201cdid they not carry in their genes this will to assemble, this will not to capitulate to any faction, this incompatibility with conservatism, hatred of the other, and of division?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers of \u201cMacron, President!\u201d\n\nHe spoke of lowering taxes on companies, restraining capitalism, swiped at the \u201cobscurantism\u201d of Trump\u2019s America and denounced the National Front for \u201cbetraying fraternity because it detests those faces that don\u2019t resemble it.\u201d\n\nMostly, it wasn\u2019t concise or specific, but the crowd had not come for that.\n\nIn contrast to Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Macron has been mocked for being the darling of the \u201cbourgeois bohemians,\u201d and for his awkwardness among the working classes. He was egged in a communist suburb last year and admonished a young man to get a job to pay for a suit.\n\nBut those who braved the cold in Lyon \u2014 doctors, professors, self-described \u201ccompany heads,\u201d civil servants and many young people \u2014 appeared seduced by his high-flown rhetoric.\n\n\u201cLiberty, equality, fraternity: I don\u2019t know any other candidate who understands it so well,\u201d said Pierre-Alexandre Le Guerm, a 35-year-old town planner. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of courage, in a world where ideologies are dividing people. With his candidacy, we can have some hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith him, all the ideas are coming up from the base,\u201d said Monique Janin, 78, who was there with her husband, Raymond, 80, who had worked in the chemical industry. \u201cHe\u2019s just much more dynamic,\u201d she said of Mr. Macron. \u201cIt\u2019s about much more than simply criticizing others.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got clear ideas, and he\u2019s not a divider,\u201d said Genevi\u00e8ve Kepenekian, 70, a retired doctor. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a realist. His idea is, get the money from different sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s open. He\u2019s new. He\u2019s bringing people together. And he goes off the beaten path,\u201d said Thomas Buy, 37, who said he had a string of beauty salons in the Lyon area.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty general,\u201d Mr. Buy conceded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait a little longer to see. But one senses a real fervor.\u201d", "summary": "While he has pushed a message that includes doses from left, right and center \u2014 maintain France\u2019s social protections, keep the country in the European Union and lighten the burden on business \u2014 it is a strategy that has also made him the candidate offering something just about everyone can hate.Mr. Macron is married to his former high school drama teacher \u2014 this fascinates his countrymen \u2014 who is 24 years his senior, and he caused a scandal in his provincial hometown, Amiens, by wooing her.She shares my life from morning to night \u2014 and I\u2019ve never paid her for it,\u201d he added, slyly evoking the nepotism scandal engulfing Mr. Fillon for having kept his wife on the public payroll for no detectable work.He spoke of lowering taxes on companies, restraining capitalism, swiped at the \u201cobscurantism\u201d of Trump\u2019s America and denounced the National Front for \u201cbetraying fraternity because it detests those faces that don\u2019t resemble it.\u201dBut those who braved the cold in Lyon \u2014 doctors, professors, self-described \u201ccompany heads,\u201d civil servants and many young people \u2014 appeared seduced by his high-flown rhetoric."}
