Included is a move to start formal talks between the Syrian government and opposition groups by Jan. 1, with a goal of holding elections within 18 months.\n\nMr. Kerry conceded, however, that the effort to meet that schedule faced long odds, saying of the Jan. 1 target, \u201cthat\u2019s pushing it.\u201d\n\nThe ministers also agreed to use their countries\u2019 influence on the diverse constellation of combatants on the ground in Syria to enforce an eventual cease-fire. This would be arranged in tandem with the political transition, although the truce would not apply to the Islamic State, the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, or any other organization that is deemed a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cWe all recognize the urgency of the moment,\u201d Mr. Kerry said at a news conference after a day of intensive talks here, which began with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.\n\nVideo\n\nThe countries at the table \u201cdo not agree on all the issues when it comes to Syria,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe do agree on this: It is time for the bleeding in Syria to stop. It is time to deprive the terrorists of any single kilometer in which to hide. It is time that we come together to help the Syrian people embark on the difficult but extraordinarily high imperative of rebuilding their country.\u201d\n\nMr. Kerry sat beside Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special envoy for Syria who will have the task of bringing the government of President Bashar al-Assad and opposition groups \u2014 neither of which have been a party to the talks so far \u2014 together for formal negotiations on forming a unity government.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the efforts and will help in every way possible to gather the opposition and the government around the negotiating table,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said.\n\n\u201cThis will be a Syrian-led process, and the Syrians will decide which country they will live in.\u201d\n\nBut even as senior diplomats voiced optimism for a peaceful political solution to the bloody civil war in Syria, the rifts that have long divided them were on display, underscoring the difficulty of the diplomatic effort.\n\nMr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov sparred openly over the fate of Mr. Assad, a central question in any final agreement.\n\nLatest Updates\n\nThe United States, along with Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states, believes Mr. Assad must go as part of any final settlement, and Mr. Kerry described him on Saturday as an enabler of the Islamic State and a \u201cmagnet\u201d for foreign fighters who are spreading terror through the region and beyond.\n\n\u201cThis war won\u2019t end \u2014 this war can\u2019t end \u2014 as long as Bashar al-Assad is there,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Russia has been a strong Assad supporter, and Mr. Lavrov argued that the conflict in Syria goes far beyond him, noting that past crises in Iraq and Libya only worsened with the ouster of their leaders, Saddam Hussein and Muammar el-Qaddafi.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
