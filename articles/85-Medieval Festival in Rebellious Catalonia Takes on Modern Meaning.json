But even if its street performances date to the 14th century, and its oldest official document is from 1621, the Patum continues to evolve.\n\nLike many such festivals, the Patum has religious origins, celebrated during the Catholic Feast of Corpus Christi, but it also has strong pagan elements.\n\nIn medieval times, the Patum\u2019s dancing followed a drum beat, whose \u201cpa-tum\u201d sound probably gave the festival its name. A band was later added, and on Sunday one of the dances was even performed to music adapted from a Bruce Springsteen song.\n\nThe mayor justified the decision to reduce the Patum\u2019s links to the church in the context of a secular society with weakening ties to Catholicism.\n\n\u201cThat things have always been done a certain way doesn\u2019t mean you should never adapt to how we live and feel, in a secular country,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIn the 21st century, I see no need for the church to keep the same role in this feast.\u201d\n\nMs. Ventur\u00f3s\u2019s defiance has reached beyond the Patum. In April, she refused to appear in court after being charged with flying the Estelada, a flag that has become an emblem for Catalan secessionists, on the town hall during elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand in a politicized trial, shaped by the politicians in Madrid, when I\u2019m now helping build a new country,\u201d Ms. Ventur\u00f3s said. \u201cI\u2019m here to respond to the will of my own people.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRamon Minoves Pujols, a town hall councilor from the conservative Convergence party, said the mayor should have gone to Mass on Sunday to represent the city, even if she did not agree with Mass. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lack of respect,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Minoves Pujols wore a suit and tie, like most others from his party, in contrast to the sleeveless tops and T-shirts chosen by the mayor and her colleagues from the Popular Unity Candidacy, known by its Catalan acronym, CUP. These colleagues included Francesc Ribera, a musician turned politician better known as Titot, whose band, Brams, became popular in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started singing, the independence movement was residual in Catalonia, but now that independence really drives us forward, it\u2019s normal to make it a more important part of our feast,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Carriers used to be paid to lift the giant statues, he noted, but \u201cpeople now fight for this honor.\u201d\n\nAfter municipal elections in May last year, Berga and its roughly 16,000 inhabitants became the most important Catalan town hall run by the CUP, a radical party that has punched above its weight in Catalan politics recently and is playing a pivotal role in the secession drive.\n\nAfter forcing the replacement of Artur Mas as Catalonia\u2019s regional president in January, CUP lawmakers are threatening to scuttle a regional budget deal if other separatist parties do not accelerate the secessionist plan. The budget dispute could force Catalonia to hold repeat elections.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Patum lasts five days, officially culminating on Sunday, but it stretched into the early hours of Monday. During a final collective frenzy, the town\u2019s asymmetric square, overflowing with thousands of dancing revelers, was invaded by masked demons, known as Plens.\n\nThe demons used the cover of darkness to spread across the crowd and set off firecrackers attached to their costumes, turning the square into a hellish ball of fire and smoke. (About 900 firecrackers and 100 flares were used.)\n\nMonitoring the earlier stages of the Patum from the top of the town hall, Joaquim Mas, an official in charge of the logistics and pyrotechnics of the festival, said that he was delighted to see the Estelada hanging from balconies, as well as wrapped around the neck of the eagle and dragon statues. He added that he was equally pleased that he did not see any priest on the balcony.\n\n\u201cThis has always been a great occasion for Berga and Catalonia, but I really feel everything has just got perfect this year,\u201d Mr. Mas said. He added that he was also looking forward to the final inferno re-creation, but partly for more practical reasons.\n\n\u201cAll good things need to come to an end \u2014 and I\u2019ve not slept for four nights,\u201d he said.", "summary": "The Patum is the only surviving festival of its kind in Catalonia, a distinction recognized by Unesco, which designated it in 2005 as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.Mr. Minoves Pujols wore a suit and tie, like most others from his party, in contrast to the sleeveless tops and T-shirts chosen by the mayor and her colleagues from the Popular Unity Candidacy, known by its Catalan acronym, CUP.Santi Vila, Catalonia\u2019s regional cultural minister, who was visiting on Sunday from Barcelona, the Catalan capital, said, \u201cIf there was not such a strong patriotic feeling here, I think the Patum probably wouldn\u2019t have resisted to all the political regimes and changes over so many centuries.\u201dThe demons used the cover of darkness to spread across the crowd and set off firecrackers attached to their costumes, turning the square into a hellish ball of fire and smoke.Monitoring the earlier stages of the Patum from the top of the town hall, Joaquim Mas, an official in charge of the logistics and pyrotechnics of the festival, said that he was delighted to see the Estelada hanging from balconies, as well as wrapped around the neck of the eagle and dragon statues."}
