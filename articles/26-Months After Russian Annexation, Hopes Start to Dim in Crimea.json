Putin\u2019s promise in April 2014 to turn it into a showcase of his rule now seems as faded as Crimea\u2019s aging, Soviet-era resorts.\n\nPhoto\n\nCrimea, many here are now realizing, could face years in limbo, no longer part of Ukraine but not yet fully absorbed by Russia. Crimeans\u2019 dreams of becoming the next Sochi, the $50 billion showcase site of the 2014 Winter Olympics, have crashed right along with the oil prices that have delayed such megaprojects in Russia.\n\nShchyolkino, a collection of a few dozen squat apartment blocks with no natural gas connection, is particularly hard hit by the power failure, having a maximum of four hours of electricity a day and two of those in the middle of the night. But life is not particularly wonderful anywhere in Crimea right now.\n\nMany restaurants and shops are running on portable generators, displaying them at their front doors to demonstrate to customers that it is business as usual. Their steady growl has become the urban backbeat. After sundown the darkened streets quickly empty. Restaurants close at 8 p.m. and alcohol sales stop at 5 p.m. to encourage people to stay home at night.\n\nSome stores get by without cash registers, and long lines snake out in front of any operational A.T.M.s. Without traffic lights, major city intersections are jammed. Highways are dark, too, so only in broad daylight can travelers see posters of Mr. Putin with the inscription: \u201cCrimea. Russia. Forever.\u201d Gasoline is in scarce supply, producing long lines of angry drivers in front of the few stations that have it.\n\nKerch, a city of ornate streetlights that stand dark, receives at most 15 percent of the electricity it needs. A diesel generator powers the local hospital, a rusty old Soviet building. Alexei Prosolkov, the deputy head for security, said the hospital was functioning normally except for canceling some energy-intensive procedures like X-rays.\n\nSchools have been shut for the past week, though a few are now reopening. A poster in front of one closed school in Kerch said that Crimeans \u201cbecame victims of a sudden terrorist act, unprecedented in Russian history.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChildren in Shchyolkino laughed about their unplanned vacation. At night they play board games by candlelight, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe electricity crisis has its roots in the strained relations between the Crimean authorities and the Tatars, who are demanding an end to discrimination and the release of jailed activists.\n\nThe 277,000 Tatar residents of Crimea, a Muslim minority, say they have suffered systemic discrimination under Russian rule, with their independent news media shuttered along with their assembly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Nariman Dzhelalov, one of the few remaining Tatar leaders in Crimea, said that the promises proved empty.\n\n\u201cIn February, I spoke with very senior government representatives who told me that either we must become subordinate to them or they will make us leave,\u201d said Mr. Dzhelalov, 35, sitting in a cafe in central Simferopol. \u201cThey said, \u2018Russia is not very liked in the world already, so if they will dislike us a little more, so what?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFeelings have hardened on the other side as well. \u201cThe Tatars have not accepted Russian authority here in earnest, for instance they are very glad that Turkey downed a Russian bomber in Syria,\u201d said Aleksander A. Formanchuk, a former Soviet public servant and now a local official. \u201cRegardless of what the Russian authorities did, there would still be discontent among the Tatars. This energy blockade was inevitable, but as a result they have lost Crimea forever.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, Mr. Formanchuk fielded a steady stream of phone calls from people complaining about the lack of electricity. There was not enough power to make everybody happy, Mr. Formanchuk said, although he agreed that the government could do more to improve the lives of ordinary people.\n\nBut that will be hard so long as the main electricity lines are lying in a muddy field in Ukraine. Crimea can generate only one-third of the electricity it needs, and a so-called energy bridge to Russia, a power line scheduled to become partly operational this month, will not close the gap.\n\nToday, the main lifeline to Russia is a ferry to a remote corner of the Krasnodar region that is operating without hindrance during the blackout, but which the Tatar activists have also threatened to halt. In 2014, the Kremlin pledged to spend 658 billion rubles (about $10 billion) to improve the peninsula\u2019s infrastructure, including a $3.4 billion bridge to mainland Russia. But little has been forthcoming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo one is quite sure how long the blackout might last. The Ukrainian government has said the lines should be fixed but made no move to remove the protesters blocking repair crews. Although the Kremlin has voiced concern, it has not tried to force a solution. Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet headquartered in Sevastopol said its operations were unaffected.\n\nFor now, new rituals are taking hold. Every day at noon, Shchyolkino\u2019s mayor speaks to residents on the city\u2019s main Crimean Spring Square, which was renamed during the annexation. Boiled water and warm food are distributed in front of an old movie theater. People can charge their cellphones and watch the latest Russian news on a TV screen, though some said they enjoyed life without television.\n\nAs often happens in Russia, some blame Washington rather than Moscow or Kiev.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the Americans none of it could have happened. The Tatars, who are supported by the United States, would not do a thing,\u201d said Tatyana Bragina, 57, an energetic woman who also once worked construction at a nearby, unfinished nuclear plant.\n\n\u201cPlease write that we are not desperate. On the contrary, we are full of joy,\u201d Ms. Bragina said, standing near a black iron kettle boiling away in the courtyard of her apartment block.", "summary": "Twenty months after the Kremlin annexed the Black Sea peninsula amid an outpouring of patriotic fervor by the ethnic Russian population, President Vladimir V.
