Relocation Program", "authors": ["Liz Alderman"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/world/europe/migrants-in-greece-ready-to-go-anywhere-in-europe-scramble-to-enter-eu-relocation-program.html", "body": "Some are now taking steps to settle in Greece, a battered country that may struggle to integrate them at a time when a quarter of the population is jobless. But many more are vying to get into the European Union relocation program, which is supposed to disperse 160,000 refugees, mostly from the Middle East, in countries across Europe.\n\n\u201cPeople are scared. A lot of them are saying we have no hope,\u201d said Yousif Karoija, a Syrian who has been living for weeks in Piraeus, the port of Athens, after being tear-gassed when he tried to cross Greece\u2019s northern border. \u201cThese people will apply to the relocation program now; they are tired, and will go anywhere in Europe,\u201d he said, sweeping his eyes over a crowd of nearly 5,000 women, children and men camped in squalid conditions around the port.\n\nThe timing could not be worse. Since Islamic State assailants bombed Brussels last week in terror attacks that killed 31 people, Europe\u2019s focus has swung sharply to security, raising the prospect of a further tightening of the European Union\u2019s migration policies. The attacks renewed a bitter debate over migrants as right-wing European politicians urged a halt to mass immigration in speeches that conflated refugees with terrorism.\n\nPhoto\n\nPoland on Wednesday abandoned its pledge to take more than 6,000 migrants under the European Union relocation program, citing the attacks. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow for events in Western Europe to happen in Poland,\u201d said Rafal Bochenek, a spokesman for the conservative government.\n\nFor Mr. Haki and the men with whom he was sheltered, the future was thrown into question yet again.\n\n\u201cWe left a dangerous situation,\u201d said Mr. Haki, who was transferred from a military camp near a muddy refugee encampment in Idomeni to a cramped apartment in a run-down Athens neighborhood after registering for the program with the United Nations refugee agency. \u201cWe hope every country will have an open mind. But after Brussels, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nEven before the bombings, Europe\u2019s welcome was wearing thin. The new European Union accord with Turkey, which authorizes migrant deportations starting April 4, was sealed rapidly last week to dissuade asylum seekers from coming after more than one million reached Europe last year. Aid agencies withdrew some operations in Greece this week to protest the deal, which they say flouts international law.\n\nCountries opposing a further migrant influx have also resisted implementing the European Union relocation accord, which is barely functioning. Under the pact struck in September, European countries agreed to take asylum seekers from Greece and Italy to help share the burden.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Austria, Hungary and Slovakia have refused to comply. Others have dragged their feet: France has so far agreed to take just 1,300 migrants out of 19,431 places pledged, while Germany opened 40 spots out of 27,479. Belgium has made 30 places available out of 3,788. All told, fewer than 1,000 refugees have been relocated since the pact took effect.\n\nMr. Haki heard about the relocation plan at the military camp, where the United Nations refugee agency and aid organizations offer information and sign-ups.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

With the exception of two Greek families, everyone in the five-story building was a refugee from Syria or Iraq.\n\n\u201cWe need a future,\u201d said Mohamoud Sharour, 23, who said he had fled conflict in Aleppo. \u201cRight now we\u2019re stuck. We wait, we sleep, smoke cigarettes. But we want to work, and build a life.\u201d\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nEveryone was worried that the attacks on Brussels might cloud their chance of getting into Europe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid people will think we are all Daesh,\u201d said Ahmed Arab, 22, also from Aleppo, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cPeople watch TV, they see that Muslims killed people, and they think all Muslims are the same. But I\u2019m not the same. Do we look like Daesh?\u201d he asked, smiling as he lifted his teacup.\n\n\u201cWe are more frightened than the Europeans, because we\u2019ve seen this before \u2014 bombs, shooting,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get away from.\u201d\n\nThe relocation process can take months as European Union countries conduct background security checks on applicants, said Jean-Pierre Schembri, a spokesman for the European Asylum Support Office, which oversees the program. He added that it was too early to tell if more countries would resist taking migrants after the Brussels attacks.\n\nUntil recently, most migrants had avoided applying, because the program does not permit them to choose the country where they would be settled. People with family in Germany, for instance, feared they would be kept apart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut now that there is a rush to the doors, the Greek authorities are overwhelmed. Last week, the program was suspended briefly after thousands of people hurried to apply.\n\nWhile Mr. Haki and the others had help, the vast majority of migrants still do not. For them, figuring out the way forward remains a Kafkaesque undertaking, often ending in desperation.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, a restless crowd formed outside Athens\u2019 central asylum center, seeking information on the relocation program. Guards pushed them away and distributed leaflets with instructions to call via Skype for an appointment.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have Skype!\u201d shouted a group of older Syrian men. \u201cI have it,\u201d said a young Afghani man, brandishing a cellphone. \u201cBut every time I call, no one answers.\u201d\n\nHannah Asman, a Syrian refugee trying to join her husband and son in Germany, held her head in her hands and collapsed into a dead faint on the sidewalk after a guard ejected her. Mr. Haki and his friends, among the few to have an appointment, doused her with water for several minutes to help her revive.\n\n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she said when she came to, tears streaming down her cheeks. \u201cHow will I ever get to Germany now?\u201d", "summary": "Since Islamic State assailants bombed Brussels last week in terror attacks that killed 31 people, Europe\u2019s focus has swung sharply to security, raising the prospect of a further tightening of the European Union\u2019s migration policies.
