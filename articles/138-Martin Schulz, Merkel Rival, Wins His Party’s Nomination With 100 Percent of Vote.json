{"title": "Martin Schulz, Merkel Rival, Wins His Party\u2019s Nomination With 100 Percent of Vote", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/19/world/europe/germany-martin-schulz-angela-merkel.html?action=click&contentCollection=Europe&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article", "body": "After the unanimous endorsement of his election bid, Mr. Schulz jubilantly declared, \u201cThis vote is the start of capturing the chancellery.\u201d\n\nHe was nominated as the new party leader only in late January and has since been embraced by the center-left with an \u00e9lan not seen in years. More than 13,000 people have joined the Social Democrats in recent weeks \u2014 a fact celebrated by party leaders even though 2016 membership, at around 438,000, was 130,000 less than a decade earlier.\n\nSignificantly, the 153-year-old Social Democrats have drawn level with Ms. Merkel\u2019s center-right bloc, with both hovering around 31 or 32 percent in polls. Currently, the two govern in a coalition led by Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives.\n\nThough German politicians and voters are used to the compromises of coalition politics, the partnership seems likely to grow testier. If so, some commentators said, that would be another sign of the effect Mr. Trump is having across a continent he often scorns.\n\nLast week in the Netherlands, and in December in Austria, centrist parties beat back the rising tides of nationalist populism, not quashing the far right but denying it further claim on national leadership. Commentators say that Mr. Trump has galvanized even Europeans skeptical of the European Union, a bloc often derided as remote and unknowable to the almost 500 million people who live in its 28 member states.\n\nUnease about Mr. Trump means that he \u201chas had a much bigger effect in Europe than in the United States,\u201d Rolf Kleine, a senior political editor of the best-selling Bild newspaper, said on the sidelines of the Social Democrats\u2019 convention.\n\n\u201cSuddenly,\u201d Mr. Kleine said, \u201cpeople got frightened.\u201d They \u201chave seen what the results are when you elect people you perhaps had better not have elected,\u201d he added.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In a subsequent post on Twitter, he claimed that Germany owed \u201cvast sums\u201d for past American defense.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen, on Saturday, American resistance deprived the German hosts of a Group of 20 finance ministers\u2019 summit meeting of a usually routine declaration against protectionism.\n\nMs. Merkel, known for her patience and for waiting out crises, has not reacted to either the NATO demands or the Group of 20 statement. But her close ally, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen of Germany, issued a sharp statement on Sunday in which she denied Mr. Trump\u2019s contention.\n\n\u201cThere is no debt account in NATO,\u201d Ms. von der Leyen said, adding that it was \u201cfalse\u201d to view the 2 percent pledged for military spending by each member as exclusively for NATO. Included in the sum, which Germany is set to reach over the next decade, is support for United Nations peacekeeping missions and the fight against the Islamic State. \u201cWhat we all want is fair burden-sharing, which requires a modern understanding of security,\u201d Ms. von der Leyen said.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump continues to unsettle, opponents might argue that Mr. Schulz, who failed to finish high school and is entirely untested in national politics, also represents a risk. But Mr. Schulz, a former bookseller, has a compelling personal story, more than 20 years of experience in European structures and, above all, a message that Germans appear newly eager to hear. Since he was chosen as the Social Democrats\u2019 leader and embraced a simple slogan, \u201cMore Justice,\u201d his party has advanced. Supporters chant \u201cMartin! Martin!\u201d when he appears and wave placards proclaiming that it is \u201ctime for Schulz.\u201d\n\nHis rise has apparently blunted the advances of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which now runs around 9 to 10 percent in polls. The Green and Left parties are also stuck around 8 percent each, with the liberal Free Democrats hovering around the 5 percent hurdle that must be cleared to win parliamentary seats.\n\nSo far, Mr. Schulz has provided almost no details of what his policies might be and says he will outline his program only in late June. Even supporters worry that this leaves him vulnerable.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, he is everybody\u2019s darling,\u201d said Steffen Burmeister, 54, who is active in local politics near Hamburg. \u201cHe can bring people along, and he has the right themes.\u201d In addition, he said, \u201cit is a very important signal that he is someone who has worked so hard for Europe, and at the top of the structure.\u201d Still, Mr. Burmeister argued, more \u201cfresh faces\u201d are needed.\n\nMr. Schulz sought to appeal to voters of all ages: invoking the iconic Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who pioneered d\u00e9tente with the Soviets, for older generations and seeking to woo younger ones with concern for their future.\n\nAnne Wachter, 27, works for the Social Democrats. Embracing a life-size image of Mr. Schulz, which she said she had carried nationwide to appearances in recent weeks, she rejected the idea that his advance was a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s rise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think we just let Donald Trump be,\u201d she said, \u201cand make our own policy.\u201d"}
