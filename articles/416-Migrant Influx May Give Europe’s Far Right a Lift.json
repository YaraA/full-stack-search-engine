People are starting to realize that this is a serious problem for Sweden.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThe new rightist government in Denmark has taken out advertisements in the Lebanese press warning refugees not to come, that the government has toughened immigration laws and cut benefits.\n\nIn France, in a speech on Sunday to her National Front party, which warns about Islam, immigration and a powerful German-dominated Brussels, Marine Le Pen accused Germany of opening its doors to refugees to exploit them for cheap labor, while imposing its immigration policies on its neighbors.\n\n\u201cGermany seeks not only to rule our economy, it wants to force us to accept hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers,\u201d she said in Marseille.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReferring to the death of a Syrian boy in Turkey and other asylum seekers in a truck in Austria, all at the hands of human traffickers, she accused European politicians of \u201cexploiting the death of the unfortunate in these trips organized by mafia. They show pictures, they exhibit the death of a child without any dignity, just to blame the European consciences and make them accept the current situation.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian civil war is now in its fifth year, and the numbers are staggering. More than four million Syrians have fled the country and are registered as refugees, while another 6.5 million are internally displaced, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There are more than 1.9 million Syrian refugees in Turkey alone, another 1.1 million in Lebanon and more than 629,000 in Jordan.\n\nEurope cannot take them all.\n\nIn Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced something close to pride on Monday that Germany is now seen as a desirable and welcoming destination for refugees. \u201cThat is something very valuable, if you look at our history,\u201d she said.\n\nBut many fear a backlash. There have been more than 200 attacks on asylum seekers or their shelters this year in Germany. In the pretty south German town of Rottenburg am Neckar, officials are investigating as possible arson a fire that broke out at 2 a.m. Monday, injuring six people, in a facility housing 84.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That \u201csends the wrong signal to individual countries,\u201d said Gerda Hasselfeldt, the party\u2019s leader in the federal Parliament.\n\nThe C.S.U. welcomed a government decision late Sunday to reduce cash allowances for refugees as a victory for their harder line. \u201cThere will be less incentive in the future for unfounded applications for asylum,\u201d said the party\u2019s general secretary, Andreas Scheuer.\n\nSigmar Gabriel, the leader of the Social Democrats and vice chancellor, acknowledged that beyond the cheers and handouts of chocolates and toys, there were what he called very real worries, fears and conflicts.\n\n\u201cWe have to be realistic about this from the start to avoid disappointments,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage to take in 800,000 this year, accommodate and integrate them, too. But it is also clear for everyone that that cannot repeat every year.\u201d\n\nGermany so far has little trouble with far-right political parties. The nationalist Alternative for Germany has split; the anti-immigrant marches have also died down. But neo-Nazis openly battled police at an asylum facility at Heidenau, near Dresden, last month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Austria, arson attacks are rare. But a strong populist party, the right-wing Freedom Party, has made noticeable gains in the months of refugee crisis.\n\nAustria expects the same proportion of asylum applications, 1 percent of the population, as Germany. In bellwether elections in Vienna in October, the Freedom Party now threatens to outperform the Social Democrats, making inroads particularly among lower classes with strident anti-Muslim rhetoric.\n\nSome observers believe the sympathy shown to refugees may have tipped the scales away from the rightists.\n\n\u201cThese feelings are transitory, of course, but they won\u2019t fade without leaving some trace,\u201d said Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof, a columnist for the center-left weekly Profil.\n\nAustrians have traditionally welcomed migrants and felt good doing so this weekend, particularly since almost none of the arriving thousands planned to stay, he said. \u201cFor us, this feeling of doing good has come almost for free \u2014 at least for the time being.\u201d\n\nThe issue is sensitive in Britain, too, which last year had net immigration of 330,000 people and where Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure from his own party and from the U.K. Independence Party to bring down the numbers or withdraw from the European Union.\n\nUnder public pressure, Mr. Cameron has now agreed to take up to 20,000 Syrian refugees from camps in the region over the next five years as a humanitarian gesture, and will increase to 1 billion pounds a year humanitarian aid to Syria.\n\nMr. Cameron has promised a referendum on continued British membership in the European Union by the end of 2017, but possibly to take place next autumn. But what appears to be a European mess and more immigration has been a boon for those opposed to continued British membership.\n\nMr. Bildt, of Sweden, says that in the long run, the European Union will come up with some better solutions. \u201cBut we have to find a coherent European response. Controlling the outer border of Schengen is vital to the system,\u201d he said, referring to the passport-free zone within Europe. \u201cIt is uncomfortable but necessary, and it needs to be done.\u201d", "summary": "In the pretty south German town of Rottenburg am Neckar, officials are investigating as possible arson a fire that broke out at 2 a.m. Monday, injuring six people, in a facility housing 84.
