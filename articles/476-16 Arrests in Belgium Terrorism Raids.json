The authorities announced that schools and subways in Brussels would remain closed on Monday.\n\nA railway station under the headquarters of the European Union\u2019s executive branch remained sealed off on Sunday, and all traffic on the Brussels metro system was suspended. Soldiers with automatic weapons patrolled malls. Several big stores stayed closed. A huge Sunday market near the Brussels-South railway station that usually draws as many as 50,000 shoppers was canceled.\n\nMr. Michel said Saturday that the threat level had been raised because of \u201cinformation, relatively precise, of a risk of an attack similar to the one that unfolded in Paris.\u201d\n\nBernard Clerfayt, the mayor of Schaerbeek, a commune of Brussels, was more loose-tongued. On Sunday, he told the Belgian television network RTBF that \u201cthere are two terrorists on the ground in the Brussels region.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the French authorities published a new call on Sunday for witnesses related to the attacks in Paris and last week\u2019s raid in St.-Denis, appealing for more information about the suicide bomber who was the second of three attackers to detonate explosives vests outside the Stade de France.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe call for witnesses, published by the French national police on Twitter, included a picture but not a name, and asked anybody who had information on the person to contact the authorities. The second suicide bomber detonated his vest near Gate H of the stadium, killing only himself.\n\nThe first detonated his explosives near Gate D, killing one other person. A Syrian passport for a 25-year-old man named Ahmad al-Mohammad, from Idlib, Syria, was found near his body, but the French authorities believe the passport may have been stolen.\n\nOn Friday, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said that fingerprints for both the first and second bombers were taken at the same check for migrants in Greece on Oct. 3. The third bomber, identified as Bilal Hadfi, 20, a French citizen living in Belgium, detonated his explosives on the nearby Rue de la Cokerie but did not kill anybody else.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Lazez, who grew up in the same Molenbeek neighborhood as some of the Paris attackers, denied any link to the attacks, his lawyer said.\n\nMr. Abdeslam was stopped by French police officers on Nov. 14, a few hours after the attacks, during a routine traffic check as he drove back to Brussels with two friends, both of whom have since been arrested. He had a criminal record but no warrant linked to his file, and he had not yet been tied to the attacks, so he was allowed to drive on.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of the two men traveling with him and now under arrest has since told the police that Mr. Abdeslam had been wearing a big jacket, \u201cwith something underneath,\u201d according to the suspect\u2019s lawyer, Carine Couquelet. While he did not know what it was, the lawyer said, the sight of it \u201cmade him scared.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr. Lazez\u2019s lawyer, his client never met Salah or his brother, Ibrahim Abdeslam, one of the suicide bombers in Paris. Mr. Lazez was not friends with Abdelhamid Abaaoud either, he said. Mr. Abaaoud, another Molenbeek resident, was the presumed ringleader of the Paris attacks and was killed in a police raid just north of the French capital on Wednesday.\n\nMohamed, another brother of Salah Abdeslam who was detained briefly after the attacks but released, appealed for Salah to turn himself in.\n\n\u201cWe wish for him to turn himself in,\u201d he told RTBF television in an interview on Sunday. \u201cTo answer us. For our family, for the family of victims, for all the others. We prefer to see him in prison than in a cemetery.\u201d\n\nHe said he had not paid attention when the attitudes of his two brothers began to change six months ago. \u201cThey started praying,\u201d Mohamed said. \u201cOr they stopped drinking alcohol, but it\u2019s not a radical change. For me it\u2019s the sign of people who wanted to chasten themselves, and to be more respectful of their religion.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether his brother Salah might have been reluctant to participate in the attacks, Mohamed said: \u201cIt is my hope that he stepped back at the last minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he saw or heard something that made him turn back. After, did he kill victims? Was he at the exact location? Was he there until the end? We don\u2019t know.\u201d", "summary": "The operation, the biggest in the Belgian capital since the Paris attack, began shortly after a government meeting on the crisis and a decision to maintain for a second day the highest possible alert level in Brussels.
