Most of the encampment\u2019s permanent residents had been there so long that they had achieved legal immigration status.\n\nBut word had gone out that it was a place where the new migrants, Eritreans in the latest wave, could stop on their way north.\n\nAccording to the Roman authorities, it was the flow of newcomers that forced them to move on the camp. The transients swelled the camp\u2019s population, spilling out into a parking lot in front, creating an eyesore and, the authorities said, a potential health hazard.\n\n\u201cWhen you have such important migratory movements, it becomes a social and health problem,\u201d said Francesca Danese, Rome\u2019s municipal councilor in charge of social issues, including housing. \u201cThe situation was unsustainable. People can\u2019t live in those conditions.\u201d\n\nAll together, there were about 300 people at Ponte Mammolo on Monday. About 200 were transients, and when the bulldozers and the police arrived, many panicked and ran away. Once new arrivals are identified as immigrants, they are required by European Union laws to request asylum in the first country where they set foot, and because of the weak economy in Italy, most do not want to remain here.\n\nPhoto\n\nOthers, including some of Ponte Mammolo\u2019s permanent residents, were taken to dormitories run by private associations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMarco, an Ecuadorean construction worker with a residency permit, and his wife were among the permanent dwellers at the camp. He said he had received a frantic call at work from his wife saying she had been told she had 15 minutes to pack. She filled three garbage bags, making sure to include Marco\u2019s work clothes. Whatever happened, he still had a job to go to.\n\nIn the space of a morning, \u201cour life was turned inside out, I still can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Marco, 43, who asked that his last name not be used because his employer did not know where he had been living. In his 14 years at Ponte Mammolo, he had transformed a small, existing building into a home with electricity, water, even Internet and cable television. \u201cWe\u2019d just finished paying off our fridge and washing machine last month,\u201d he said.\n\nSome of those displaced found friends to stay with, others rented rooms. Still others refused to leave, camping out in the parking lot.\n\nDobro, a Montenegrin in his 60s and one of the encampment\u2019s first residents, vowed that he would stay until he found his cat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind sleeping in the parking lot. I am not leaving,\u201d he said, his eyes welling with tears. All he had left were the clothes he was wearing, he said, gesturing at his grungy blue track suit.\n\nNongovernmental organizations that had volunteered at the camp concede that Ponte Mammolo was untenable, but say that there was a better way to deal with the problem. Many said the bulldozers exemplified the clumsy ways that Italy has dealt with a crisis that does not seem likely to end soon.\n\n\u201cThe choice of evacuation was paradoxical because so many ended up on the streets,\u201d said Fabiola Zanetti, of Prime Italia, which developed job training programs for some of the refugees. \u201cIt was urgent to eliminate this at-risk place, but not in this way.\u201d\n\nSome aid workers suggested that complaints from neighbors had led the city to act. The timing, some noted, followed gains by anti-immigrant political parties in local elections this month.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The parking lot in front of Ponte Mammolo was built for tourist buses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPonte Mammolo is only one of several makeshift encampments in Rome. Migrants with precarious job prospects, even those with residence permits or refugee status, receive no tangible support from the city. Rents in Rome can easily absorb the lion\u2019s share of an average salary \u2014 and can far exceed what is left after the newcomers send money to families in far-flung homelands.\n\nThough they may have been there temporarily in principle, for many migrants at Ponte Mammolo the impromptu lodgings became home. Among the dwellings were prefabricated structures assembled by a handful of Ukrainian residents, with brightly colored flowers on their stoops.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI managed to pack my religious images and a few clothes,\u201d but left behind the furnishings of a prefabricated home, said Olha Larcik, 67, who was raised in Ukraine and lived in the camp for four years, the best she could afford on disability payments and her pension.\n\nRed-eyed \u201cfrom three days of tears,\u201d she wondered what would become of her. Transported to a dormitory on the outskirts of the city, she had no idea what would come next. \u201cI have one euro in my pocket,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore the bulldozers arrived, said Ms. Danese, the city councilor, the longtime residents of the camp were contacted by social workers. Many residents, however, denied that they had been contacted.\n\nMore important, Ms. Danese said, is for Rome \u201cto do real integration\u201d with the camp residents, as well as establish \u201ca humanitarian corridor\u201d for the migrants on their way north. But, she said, at a time of cutbacks the city did not have the money to cover such large numbers.\n\nDaniela Pompei of the Community of St. Egidio, an organization that regularly brought food and drinks to the residents since 1998, said the refugees would keep coming, as long as there were wars. \u201cBig cities are just going to have to deal with it, it\u2019s their responsibility,\u201d she said.\n\nMarco said the city had been negotiating with residents and humanitarian agencies to find a solution to the illegal encampment for two years, but left them unprepared for the sudden evacuation.\n\nIn February, Pope Francis made an impromptu visit to Ponte Mammolo.\n\n\u201cHe told us to be serene, that we had his blessing,\u201d Marco said, \u201cbut it all fell apart.\u201d", "summary": "Once new arrivals are identified as immigrants, they are required by European Union laws to request asylum in the first country where they set foot, and because of the weak economy in Italy, most do not want to remain here.
