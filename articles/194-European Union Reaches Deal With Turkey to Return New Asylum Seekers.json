{"title": "European Union Reaches Deal With Turkey to Return New Asylum Seekers", "authors": ["James Kanter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/world/europe/european-union-turkey-refugees-migrants.html", "body": "The deal calls for Turkey to receive about $6.6 billion in aid to help organizations look after the migrants there. Also promised are visa-free travel for its citizens in most of Europe by this summer if Turkey meets certain conditions, and the eventual resumption of negotiations with Turkey on membership in the European Union.\n\nThe European Union also will resettle one Syrian from a camp in Turkey in exchange for each Syrian who used an irregular route to reach Greece.\n\nThe first exchanges could take place as soon as April 4, European Union officials said.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been living in squalid conditions in Greece on the border with Macedonia, which has denied entry to the migrants.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe deal reached Friday on returning migrants to Turkey applies only to new migrants who have arrived in Greece and excludes those already there. European Union officials said on Friday that migrants who arrive on Greek islands after midnight on Saturday would fall under the new rules.\n\nThe migrants currently in Greece could eventually be moved to other parts of the European Union if they qualify for asylum.\n\nThe accord with Turkey represents a moment of painful compromise for Europe. Turkey has taken an authoritarian turn under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Europe was forced to accept some Turkish demands to gain its cooperation in stopping the large numbers of people using the Aegean to reach Greece.\n\nConfirmation of the deal came from Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, who oversees summit meetings. There was \u201cunanimous agreement between\u201d all leaders with the Turkish prime minister, Mr. Tusk wrote on his Twitter account.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than a million migrants arrived on European shores last year, and there has been no sign of the pace letting up. Almost 155,000 people have arrived in Europe already this year as of Thursday, the vast majority of them in Greece, according to the International Organization for Migration, and the numbers could rise as the weather turns warmer.\n\nPutting this huge and delicate operation into effect over the course of a single weekend will be difficult. European officials wanted to quickly put the measure in place to prevent a rush of migrants seeking to reach Greece before the deal takes effect.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It \u201cdoes not have the financial or administrative bandwidth to implement this agreement, so it will need substantial support from Europe \u2014 far more than is currently being talked about.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations refugee agency is among the organizations to have issued stern warnings about the plans to return migrants to Turkey, and it took a cautious line on the deal. \u201cWe now need to see how this will be worked out in practice, in keeping with the safeguards set out in the agreement \u2014 many of which at present are not in place,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe agreement was welcomed by Ms. Merkel, who helped develop the plan at a time when much of the Continent and a substantial portion of her own country have turned against her policy of taking in almost unlimited numbers of migrants. But even she was cautious about its prospects.\n\n\u201cLet me be very clear: I am under no illusion whatsoever that what we agreed today will not meet with setbacks \u2014 there are after all enormous logistical challenges that we have to contend with,\u201d Ms. Merkel said at a news conference.\n\nOne of the main goals of the deal was to dissuade migrants from attempting the Aegean crossing, Ms. Merkel said. \u201cWhen you embark on this perilous journey, you\u2019re not only risking life and limb, but you have very little prospects for success,\u201d she said.\n\nShe emphasized that refugees arriving on Greek islands after Sunday \u201cwill not be simply returned\u201d but will be subject to \u201ca procedure that looks at each and every refugee individually,\u201d though she acknowledged that this would be a big task requiring help from European officials.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the deal represents a meaningful step in the effort to bring the migrant crisis under control, it is unclear if migrants might look for other options, turning the agreement into a temporary fix.\n\n\u201cThe bigger headache will be when the smugglers start rerouting migrants to Italy through Libya because you\u2019ve got a failed state there so no real government to make a deal with,\u201d said Guntram Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.\n\nThe debate over how to deal with the migrant wave has divided Europe, and the search for an agreement gained new urgency this month after four countries \u2014 Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia and Macedonia \u2014 effectively shut down the route used by many migrants as they move on from Greece.\n\nMost of the migrants hoped to reach Germany, but the closing of the so-called Western Balkan route left increasing numbers trapped because they could not leave Greece, had no desire to stay and could not or would not return home.\n\nPassage into Macedonia was being limited to a small number of Syrians and Iraqis each day, while people from other countries, including Afghanistan, were being treated as economic migrants and therefore ineligible to apply for asylum."}
