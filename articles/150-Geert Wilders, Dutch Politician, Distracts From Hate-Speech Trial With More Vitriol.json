{"title": "Geert Wilders, Dutch Politician, Distracts From Hate-Speech Trial With More Vitriol", "authors": ["Nina Siegal"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/world/europe/geert-wilders-netherlands-hate-trial.html", "body": "Mr. Wilders, 53, is charged with offending members of a group based on their race, and hate speech and discrimination. If convicted he could be sentenced to up to two years in prison, though people found guilty of such offenses are more commonly fined or required to do community service.\n\nA conviction could affect his career in Parliament, where he has been the leader of the Party for Freedom since 2006.\n\nMr. Wilders announced on Friday that he would not attend the trial, which is being held in a secure courtroom near Schiphol Airport outside Amsterdam. He called himself \u201ca politician who says what the politically correct elite do not want to hear.\u201d\n\nThe case revolves around two sets of remarks made near the time of municipal elections in The Hague in 2014. On March 12 of that year, Mr. Wilders told the Dutch national broadcaster NOS that he hoped the city\u2019s residents would \u201cvote for a more safe and social city, and if it would be possible, fewer Moroccans.\u201d At a rally a week later, he asked, \u201cDo you want more or fewer Moroccans in this city and in the Netherlands?\u201d The audience responded by chanting, \u201cFewer, fewer!\u201d Mr. Wilders responded, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll arrange that, then.\u201d\n\nThe primary judge of the three overseeing the case, Hendrik Steenhuis, spent more than an hour of the trial reconstructing events surrounding the two appearances.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe said he wanted to establish whether the comments had been impulsive, off-the-cuff remarks or planned in advance.\n\nOne fact that could influence the outcome, Judge Steenhuis said, was that Mr. Wilders repeated the alleged offense after the first event, despite complaints. During the March 19 appearance, Mr. Wilders acknowledged that his comments could lead to prosecution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 6,400 Dutch citizens filed complaints after that appearance, and prosecutors have said that they felt obliged to respond.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
