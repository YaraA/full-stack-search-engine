Its local and national leaders were jubilant after Sunday\u2019s results.\n\n\u201cThat is a slap in the face for Ms. Merkel,\u201d Frauke Petry, the leader of the Alternative for Germany, told the public broadcaster ZDF. \u201cThat is a slap for the chancellor in her home state.\u201d\n\nFear of refugees is particularly pronounced in Germany\u2019s formerly Communist east, where there are far fewer refugees than in the country\u2019s west.\n\nInitial analysis in poll research undertaken for the public service broadcaster ARD indicated that the far-right party had benefited heavily from people who had not voted in previous elections, and then in drawing votes from Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives. The research also showed that 75 percent of voters for the far right said they wanted to deliver a protest message to the mainstream political parties.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe turnout on Sunday was 10 percentage points higher than in the last state elections in 2011, when it was at a historic low of 51.1 percent.\n\nOne consolation for the mainstream was that the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party of Germany did not clear the 5 percent barrier required to win seats. The neo-Nazis had been in the state legislature for the past decade, winning 6 percent of the vote in 2011.\n\nThe national leader of the Social Democrats, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, appeared relieved by his party\u2019s result, which, at 30 percent, would be at least eight percentage points above polls taken two months ago. He told supporters in Berlin that Sunday\u2019s showing proved that good politics and a steadfast fighting spirit could win elections.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Courting support in the past week, he criticized Ms. Merkel for admitting so many refugees and angered the United States by declaring important American-European trade talks a failure.\n\nYet Ms. Merkel is the leader with the biggest challenge after Sunday\u2019s vote, the first of five before the national elections.\n\nIn recent weeks, her conservatives emphasized the \u201chomeland\u201d and public safety \u2014 traditionally far-right themes \u2014 in the northeast and in the city-state of Berlin, which votes on Sept. 18.\n\nAsked if it had been a mistake to try to stop the far right by embracing its themes, Mr. Tauber noted that voters had clearly shown fear of losing out in globalization and were worried for their future. \u201cIn elections, I really think you have to address the themes voters say are preoccupying them,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Merkel defended her decision to abandon border controls a year ago and admit the refugees in a welcoming outburst that has since soured.\n\n\u201cOn that weekend,\u201d she told the Bild newspaper on Saturday, \u201cit was not about opening the border for everyone \u2014 it was about not shutting it to those who had made their way to us from Hungary, on foot and in great need of help.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cIt is clear that the good work of the previous government did not concern most voters,\u201d Mr. Tauber told a sparse crowd at the Berlin headquarters of Ms. Merkel\u2019s party.
