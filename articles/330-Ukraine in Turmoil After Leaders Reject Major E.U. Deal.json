More than 20 years after declaring its freedom and hastening the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country of 46 million remains caught between Russia and the West, its aspirations for independence upended by the rivalries of bigger powers, its domestic politics riven by corruption, violence, revenge and ethno-regional strife, its people impoverished and fearful about the future.\n\nMany Ukrainians say they regard the country\u2019s political leaders since the end of the Soviet era to be a collective failure. At the same time, they say they recognize the constraints of being almost entirely dependent on Russia for energy, especially natural gas for heat, as well as the historic burden of being home to vital Russian military assets, including major installations for its Black Sea fleet.\n\n\u201cThe foundation has to be completely changed in our country, so that it would not remain a post-Soviet barrack temporarily repainted in yellow and blue,\u201d Mr. Lutsenko told the crowd, referring to the colors of the country\u2019s flag. \u201cWe have to understand that not only the president has to be changed but the entire system.\u201d\n\nMr. Lutsenko knows the perils of the system well. From his role as field commander, he went on to serve as a leader in Parliament and as the interior minister, under President Viktor A. Yushchenko, who was poisoned by dioxin in an assassination attempt during the disputed 2004 election. After Viktor F. Yanukovich, the revolution\u2019s antihero, won the presidency in 2010, Mr. Lutsenko was arrested and jailed on abuse of authority charges, only to be pardoned earlier this year as Mr. Yanukovich came under pressure from the West.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSupporters of European integration had been pinning their hopes on the political and trade agreements, which had been in the works for more than four years, and Mr. Yanukovich had long talked about signing them at a major conference that begins on Thursday in Vilnius, Lithuania.\n\nIn contrast with 2004, they say they are focused entirely on raising standards of living, and putting Ukraine on track to become a member of the European Union so they could obtain the benefits that they see are now enjoyed by neighboring Poland and by the fellow ex-Soviet republics in the Baltics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She said she wanted a country \u201cwhere people are free to tell what they think; to do what they want; to go where they dream.\u201d\n\nMs. Zhemchuzhnykova said that while her demonstrations had been relatively small, numbering 150 to 200 people each evening, and that protesters had faced some heckling, there had been no rallies in Donetsk in opposition to the accords with the European Union.\n\nTaras Berezovets, a political consultant whose clients include members of Parliament, said expectations were raised by the president, partly with an eye to the 2015 election.\n\n\u201cYanukovich promised them something; he promised them Europe,\u201d Mr. Berezovets said in an interview.\n\nUkraine\u2019s domestic politics are deeply complicated by ethno-cultural, religious and linguistic divisions. The mostly Russian-speaking and Russian Orthodox eastern and southern sections of the country tend to favor close ties with Moscow. In the West, Ukrainian speakers predominate, the Ukrainian Catholic Church has many adherents and Russia is regarded with suspicion or even hostility.\n\nIn Kiev on Wednesday, there were scattered reports of protesters clashing with the riot police. Also, the jailed former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, said she had begun a hunger strike in support of protesters.\n\nUkraine is also a country with a bloody and tragic history. Experts say about 7.5 million people died in Ukraine during World War II. Throughout its history, it has been dominated by larger powers, including Austria-Hungary and the Soviet Union. Ukraine has also been a major battleground, including a devastating 30-year stretch of war in the 1600s that involved Russians, Cossacks, Poles and Turks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRussia\u2019s desire to dominate is taken for granted in Ukraine. \u201cThis problem is going on for several hundred years; Ukraine lives in a polygon between Moscow, Istanbul and Warsaw,\u201d Mr. Lutsenko said in an interview. \u201cFiguratively speaking, the two heads of the Russian eagle from its coat of arms are looking in different directions, but every day they try to bite Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHe said Russia used several levers of power, including its ability to egg on separatist movements in the Ukrainian south, the Russian Orthodox Church\u2019s ability to stoke unrest, the possibility of levying trade sanctions and, of course, the ability to shut down natural gas pipelines.\n\nMr. Lutsenko said that in two and a half years in prison he had spent much of his time thinking about Ukraine\u2019s problems and why the 2004 revolution failed, and that Ukraine needed to develop an entirely new approach. He has formed a new political party called the Third Ukrainian Republic and hopes to help the process along.\n\nEuropean officials have said that Russia had threatened to retaliate with severe trade sanctions that would be particularly devastating in eastern Ukraine, a main base of political support for Mr. Yanukovich. Ukraine is already facing a severe economic crisis and has been in talks for months about securing a loan package from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nMany Ukrainians have tempered their criticism, hoping Mr. Yanukovich will somehow resurrect the agreements and sign them at the Vilnius conference, which he still plans to attend.\n\n\u201cHe can either become a hero, or become the biggest loser in Ukrainian history,\u201d Mr. Berezovets said. \u201cWhatever happens, the only man that people hold responsible for failure is Yanukovich himself. He has personalized European integration to that extent.\u201d"}
