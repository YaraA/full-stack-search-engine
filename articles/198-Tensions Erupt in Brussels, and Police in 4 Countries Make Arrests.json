Among those lighting candles and taking photos were blond, blue-eyed Belgians; Muslim women, their heads covered with the hijab; and dark-haired men from Belgium\u2019s large Moroccan community.\n\nSome held up flags of various countries, and one group had a banner that said, \u201cPas au Nom d\u2019Islam,\u201d meaning that the terrorist attacks had not been done in the name of Islam. Many lit candles in memory of those who had died, and some in attendance said they had friends who had been injured at the Maelbeek station on Tuesday.\n\nYousra Ziani, 16, a Belgian high school student whose parents emigrated from Morocco, said her parents had advised her against going out because they worried about her safety. She felt she had to come, saying, \u201cIt is important to show our unity and solidarity as Belgians.\u201d\n\nMs. Ziani said she lived on the street in the Forest neighborhood where a shootout on March 15 injured four police officers and killed Mohamed Belkaid, one of the men suspected of being involved in planning the attacks in Paris and Brussels.\n\n\u201cThe raid in Forest happened just in front of my eyes,\u201d she said.\n\nThe arrests announced over the weekend in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands underscored that the European authorities have yet to get a handle on the extent of terrorist networks on the Continent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.
