In his brief acceptance speech, he encouraged Germans to be bold in difficult times.\n\n\u201cIf we want to give others courage, then we must have some ourselves,\u201d he said on a day when many other speakers evoked the country\u2019s dark past and its emergence as a democracy after the Nazis\u2019 defeat in World War II.\n\nOne marvel of traveling the world, he said, was to realize that Germany has become a model. \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful that this, our difficult fatherland, is seen as an anchor of hope for many people in the world?\u201d Mr. Steinmeier said.\n\nBefore the vote, the conservative head of parliament, Norbert Lammert, gave a surprisingly fiery speech that \u2014 without mentioning names \u2014 attacked Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for trying to divide or weaken Europe.\n\n\u201cWhoever champions a closed mind instead of openness to the world, whoever literally walls themselves in, bets on protectionism instead of free trade and preaches isolationism instead of states cooperating, and declares \u2018We first\u2019 as a program, should not be surprised if others do the same \u2014 with all the fatal side effects for international ties which we know from the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Lammert said. That goes, he added, for individual European states \u201cbut also for our great partner country across the Atlantic.\u201d\n\nOnce, it would have been rare for German politicians to lecture other democracies on values, especially the United States, but Germany is now regarded as a critical pillar in upholding the liberal Western order, which is one reason the Sept. 24 national elections are being watched so closely.\n\nIt is also why some of Ms. Merkel\u2019s fellow conservatives quietly grumbled that she was outfoxed when she agreed to put Mr. Steinmeier forward as the presidential candidate of her grand coalition government, which unites her conservative bloc with the center-left Social Democrats. Even as the presidency stands above party politics, Mr. Steinmeier, 61, a lawyer and lifelong politician, is likely to be a boon for his party.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis election coincided with a Social Democratic surge in polls since the center-left chose Martin Schulz, a former president of the European Parliament, to lead them into battle against Ms. Merkel in the elections.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schulz grew up in a village in the Aachen area, becoming mayor of the nearby town of W\u00fcrselen in 1987, and likes to tell stories from those days to portray himself as an ordinary guy. He first won election to the European Parliament in 1994, going on to become president in 2012. Most unusually for a German politician, he did not finish high school with a certificate, and trained initially as a bookseller.\n\nHe outpolled Ms. Merkel in personal popularity, 50 percent to 34 percent, in the Infratest dimap survey this month, albeit with a slightly smaller degree of support than Ms. Merkel\u2019s last Social Democratic challenger had at a similar stage of the 2013 race.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her respected finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the longest-sitting member of Germany\u2019s parliament, used an interview in Der Spiegel this weekend to accuse Mr. Schulz of Trump-style populism.\n\n\u201cWhen Schulz lets his supporters shout, \u2018Make Europe great again,\u2019 then it is almost word for word Trump,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble told the newsmagazine.\n\nSigmar Gabriel, the Social Democrat who has replaced Mr. Steinmeier as foreign minister, swiftly retaliated: \u201cThe radical and ill-intentioned mockery\u201d in American politics \u201cshould not be swept in to Germany,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnquestionably, Mr. Trump\u2019s election has so deeply altered the geopolitical landscape for Ms. Merkel. She has kept a cool distance, and the two leaders are expected to meet for the first time this spring.\n\nDomestically, Ms. Merkel is contending with a continuing political backlash to her 2015 decision to admit more than one million migrants, many of them Muslim, into the country. The far-right Alternative for Germany party, which started as a movement against the euro currency, now carries an anti-migrant, anti-Muslim message and has leaders who have sympathy for Mr. Trump\u2019s politics.\n\nTellingly, Frauke Petry and other Alternative for Germany leaders did not applaud with everyone else during Mr. Lammert\u2019s speech when he attacked isolationism or what he termed a \u201cWe first\u201d attitude. Under pressure, Ms. Merkel has backpedaled somewhat in recent months, reducing the influx of migrants and taking a tougher line on deportations.\n\nAs is often the case, people outside the bubble of national politics sounded considerably less stirred when asked about Ms. Merkel\u2019s standing.\n\nMetin Elcivan, 41, who helps run a corner store in western Berlin\u2019s Sch\u00f6neberg district, was certain that German voters would prove conservative. \u201cI think nothing will change at the elections,\u201d he said, \u201cand that we will have a grand coalition again, with Merkel as chancellor.\u201d"}
