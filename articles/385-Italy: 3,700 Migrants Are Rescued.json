Italy has been trying to persuade the European Union to help it cope with waves of migrants arriving from North Africa, with official estimates putting the total at 60,000 so far this year. Almost 2,000 have died trying to make the crossing, the United Nations refugee agency has estimated. The bloc has agreed to triple funding for sea rescues off the coasts of Italy and Greece, but it is deeply divided on how to manage the migrants once they come ashore.", "summary": "Ships patrolling the Mediterranean have plucked more than 3,700 migrants from overcrowded and unsafe boats in the past two days, Italy\u2019s Coast Guard said Tuesday.Ships from several countries went to the aid of 18 boats carrying 2,741 migrants on Monday, a spokeswoman said.Italy has been trying to persuade the European Union to help it cope with waves of migrants arriving from North Africa, with official estimates putting the total at 60,000 so far this year.Almost 2,000 have died trying to make the crossing, the United Nations refugee agency has estimated.The bloc has agreed to triple funding for sea rescues off the coasts of Italy and Greece, but it is deeply divided on how to manage the migrants once they come ashore."}
