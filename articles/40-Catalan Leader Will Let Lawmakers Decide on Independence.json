Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s fragile coalition has 72 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament.\n\nThe mounting pressures on both men were evident throughout a day of confusion in a crisis that has presented Spain with one of its gravest tests since embracing democracy in 1978.\n\nMr. Puigdemont clearly hoped that a pre-emptive call for elections would hold off Madrid\u2019s intervention. Earlier on Thursday, the separatist leader scheduled, delayed and then finally canceled a televised address in which he had been expected to take such a move.\n\nHis delay was apparently designed to secure a firm pledge from Mr. Rajoy that Madrid would not impose the emergency measures, in return for Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s calling off a unilateral declaration of independence.\n\nBut in the time leading up to Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s scheduled lunchtime news conference, with word leaking out of his expected move, separatists started gathering outside the Catalan government building to protest the prospect of a U-turn.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWithout a guarantee from Madrid, Mr. Puigdemont faced instead broadening dissent in his own ranks, with some members of his conservative party announcing that they would quit if the Catalan leader opted for new elections rather than secession.\n\nThat raised the prospect of an internal revolt that could tear apart Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s independence movement.\n\nWhile Mr. Puigdemont was withdrawing his election offer, Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda, the deputy prime minister, told senators in Madrid on Thursday afternoon, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to rescue Catalonia\u201d under the emergency measures of Article 155. She defended it as the only way to force separatists to respect the rule of law.\n\nThe deputy prime minister accused Mr. Puigdemont of prolonging the conflict unnecessarily. \u201cSince last Saturday, nothing has happened, only noise and more noise,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor more than two weeks, Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Rajoy had engaged in a game of chicken over whether the Catalan leader was ready to secede unilaterally, following a confusing address to the Catalan Parliament on Oct. 10 in which Mr. Puigdemont appeared to declare independence \u2014 only to suspend it a moment later.\n\nThe pressures on both leaders have by now become formidable. Mr. Puigdemont risks decades in prison for rebellion should he push ahead with his secessionist plan.\n\nIn Madrid, Mr. Rajoy has been under severe pressure from hard-liners in his conservative party not to relent in the effort to snuff out the Catalan rebellion.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Instead, he listened as politicians from both sides highlighted the deep divisions that surround secessionism in Catalonia.\n\nAnna Gabriel, a lawmaker from the far-left Popular Unity Candidacy, told Catalan lawmakers that the government of Madrid was preparing \u201ca tsunami\u201d to take charge of Catalonia under Article 155, \u201cwithout democratic controls and legitimacy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn\u00e9s Arrimadas, the leader in Catalonia of the Ciudadanos party, which is fiercely opposed to secession, accused Mr. Puigdemont of extending an illegal and futile situation of uncertainty for Catalonia, while raising the expectations of separatists without any legitimacy.\n\n\u201cEven the trial of Kafka wasn\u2019t as Kafkaesque\u201d as Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s drive for independence, she told lawmakers. Addressing Mr. Puigdemont, she added: \u201cIf you had any legitimacy left to continue as president, you\u2019ve lost it today. You\u2019ve got nothing else to offer Catalans, not even to those who have been betting on independence.\u201d\n\nMs. Arrimadas also attacked Mr. Puigdemont for his change of mind about holding early elections. Still, she added, \u201cSooner or later the ballot boxes will reach Catalonia, and we will win, because there is a majority of Catalans who is fed up\u201d with the independence drive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMiquel Iceta, the Socialist leader in Catalonia, told lawmakers that separatism \u201chasn\u2019t made us go forward even one millimeter, either as a country or as a society.\u201d\n\nEven before Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s news conference, some were calling him a traitor.\n\n\n\nGabriel Rufi\u00e1n, a Catalan separatist member of the Spanish Parliament, wrote \u201c155 pieces of silver\u201d in a tweet, a reference to Judas\u2019s payment for betraying Jesus in the Bible.\n\nMr. Puigdemont\u2019s government has been flouting Spain\u2019s Constitution since early September, when separatist lawmakers voted on legislation to hold a binding referendum on independence on Oct. 1 as a key step toward statehood.\n\nLast week, Mr. Puigdemont warned in a letter to Mr. Rajoy that Catalan lawmakers would vote for a declaration of independence if Mr. Rajoy imposed direct rule on their region.\n\nMr. Rajoy\u2019s call for Article 155 measures \u2014 never used before \u2014 would allow him to impose direct rule and to take control of the autonomous region\u2019s police force and broadcaster.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast weekend, Mr. Rajoy pledged that Catalonia would hold new elections within six months of the introduction of his emergency measures.\n\nAfter the Oct. 1 referendum, Mr. Puigdemont was under intense pressure to declare independence, since Catalans voted for secession in the highly controversial referendum, which was marred by clashes between the Spanish police and Catalan citizens.\n\nThe vote, however, took place without legal guarantees and with most Catalan opponents of independence staying away in protest. The referendum was declared illegal by Spain\u2019s government and courts.\n\nThis month, a judge from Spain\u2019s national court ordered prison without bail for two leaders of the Catalan independence movement, pending a trial for sedition.\n\nLast weekend, Mr. Rajoy insisted that using Article 155 \u201cwas neither our desire nor our intention,\u201d but instead the only way to to return Catalonia to legality and normality and to maintain a Spanish economic recovery \u201cwhich is now under clear danger because of the capricious and unilateral decisions\u201d of the Catalan separatist government."}
