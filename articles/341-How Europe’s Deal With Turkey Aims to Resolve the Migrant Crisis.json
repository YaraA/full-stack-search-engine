{"title": "How Europe\u2019s Deal With Turkey Aims to Resolve the Migrant Crisis", "authors": ["Nick Cumming-Bruce", "Melissa Eddy", "James Kanter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/world/europe/european-union-turkey-migrants-refugees.html", "body": "\u201cAn agreement that would be tantamount to blanket returns of foreigners to a third country is not consistent with European law, is not consistent with international law,\u201d Vincent Cochetel, the director of the refugee agency\u2019s European bureau, told reporters in Geneva.\n\nQ. Would the deal put an end to the \u201cBalkans route\u201d that a million migrants have already followed to reach countries like Austria, Germany and Sweden?\n\nPhoto\n\nA. European Union officials had proposed declaring the route \u201cclosed,\u201d but the declaration won\u2019t go quite that far, saying instead that \u201cirregular flows of migrants along the Western Balkans route have now come to an end.\u201d That was a point of principle for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has steadfastly insisted that Germany will not cap the number of asylum seekers it can take in and that Europe\u2019s commitment to open borders must be upheld. She said on Monday that controlling the migrant flow \u201ccannot be based on closing something, but on a lasting agreement made together with Turkey.\u201d\n\nQ. What are the consequences for Ms. Merkel?\n\nA. The chancellor faces growing political pressure at home. In three German states that hold elections this weekend, polls suggest that an anti-immigrant party that opposes Ms. Merkel\u2019s welcoming policies will make significant gains. Though migrants reaching Germany initially got an overwhelmingly positive reception, their sheer numbers \u2014 more than a million arrived in 2015 \u2014 have stoked public fears and growing hostility.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They demanded and may win major concessions like a doubling of European aid to Turkey to assist the refugees and faster action on visas and the union membership talks, which have been sputtering on and off since 1987.\n\nThe European Union is largely turning a blind eye to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s crackdown on the media in Turkey, including the seizure of Zaman, the country\u2019s largest newspaper, on Friday. The European Union leaders\u2019 statement notes that they discussed \u201cthe situation of the media in Turkey\u201d with Mr. Davutoglu, but stopped short of condemning it.\n\nQ. What has to happen to make the agreement final?\n\nA. Officials must assess whether some terms of deal are legal. Then the deal will need to be ratified by European leaders at a summit meeting next week. And specifics like the exact amount of aid Turkey will receive still need to be hashed out.\n\nQ. How will it change the flow of migrants?\n\nA. It\u2019s not clear. If the agreement is adopted and strictly enforced, there won\u2019t be any point in attempting the perilous sea voyage to Greece, only to be sent right back to Turkey again. But the European Union has agreed to resettle only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next two years; the United Nations refugee agency called that figure \u201cvery low,\u201d given that 4.8 million Syrians have fled their homes, and it takes no account of refugees from anywhere else.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nQ. What do human rights groups think of the deal?\n\nA. They are outraged. \u201cEuropean leaders have completely lost track of reality, and the deal currently being negotiated between the E.U. and Turkey is one of the clearest examples of their cynicism,\u201d Doctors Without Borders said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThis crude calculation reduces people to mere numbers, denying them humane treatment and discarding their right to seek protection.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Watch questioned how the mass returns would work. \u201cA fundamental contradiction lies at the heart of the E.U.-Turkey deal taking shape,\u201d Bill Frelick, the group\u2019s director of the refugee program, said in a statement. \u201cThe parties failed to say how individual needs for international protection would be fairly assessed during the rapid-fire mass expulsions they agreed would take place.\u201d\n\nQ. Do European leaders plan to address these objections?\n\nA. Officials say they will deal with the legal concerns before the summit meeting. \u201cYou can be sure that the agreement that will come at the end of it will comply with both European and international law,\u201d Alexander Winterstein, deputy chief spokesman for the union\u2019s executive body, said on Tuesday, adding that \u201cit\u2019s a bit complicated.\u201d", "summary": "Though migrants reaching Germany initially got an overwhelmingly positive reception, their sheer numbers \u2014 more than a million arrived in 2015 \u2014 have stoked public fears and growing hostility.
