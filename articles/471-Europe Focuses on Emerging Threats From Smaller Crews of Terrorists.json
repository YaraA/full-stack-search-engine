Germany wants to revoke the ID cards of those suspected of traveling to join jihadist groups. In France, there is now a debate about increased surveillance powers, through something of a French Patriot Act.\n\nEven as the episodes in Paris were playing out last Thursday, Andrew Parker, director of Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, called for more authority to monitor communications. Threats are increasing, he said, as terrorist arrests rise sharply, and \u201cthree U.K. terrorist plots\u201d that could have led to deaths were disrupted in recent months.\n\n\u201cMy sharpest concern,\u201d Mr. Parker said, \u201cis the growing gap between the increasingly challenging threat and the growing availability of capabilities to address it.\u201d\n\nHis speech added to the long-running debate here about how to balance the right of privacy with the obligation to provide security for citizens. Mr. Parker warned, as Mr. Cameron did on Monday in Nottingham, that intelligence agencies should have the legal means to intercept the encrypted communications of suspected terrorists.\n\nMr. Cameron promised to ensure there would be no areas online where terrorists, criminals and pedophiles could hide. But the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, immediately criticized the proposal on privacy grounds.\n\n\u201cThe hardest problem\u201d for the intelligence services, said the former British intelligence official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, is \u201cwhat we call \u2018target acquisition,\u2019 figuring out who these people are, rather than investigating known targets.\u201d That effort, he said, requires cooperation from technology companies, which have been pressured to protect privacy since the N.S.A. leaks. \u201cThat just isn\u2019t there anymore as a consequence of Snowden,\u201d the former official said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRobert Hannigan, the director of G.C.H.Q., Britain\u2019s electronic intelligence agency, recently accused the technology companies of providing \u201ccommand-and-control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals.\u201d\n\nLone actors or small groups communicate less, or more often in person, and many have become more careful in using telephones and the Internet. Family ties help them, too. Sa\u00efd and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, the brothers killed in a police raid after being identified as suspects in the Paris attacks, would have been able to converse without raising much concern, experts said, because calls between brothers are not unusual.\n\nSometimes, family members radicalize one another. The brother and sister of Mohammed Merah, who killed seven people in Toulouse in 2012 while targeting soldiers and Jews, were more radical than he was.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Even if they are on a watch list, \u201cwhen they decide to act, unless you have an informant or what security people call \u2018exquisite intelligence,\u2019 with a phone call that says tomorrow is the day, you can\u2019t monitor and follow everyone full time.\u201d\n\nShashank Joshi, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said that a lone wolf, or a small group known as a wolf pack, operating without formal control from abroad, created enormous problems.\n\nMore on the Paris Shootings\n\nThe acquisition of a weapon \u2014 even a Kalashnikov rifle, which costs less than $2,500 on the black market, much less knives and a meat cleaver like the ones used in the attack on a British soldier, Lee Rigby, in 2013 \u2014 is unlikely to set off the kind of alarms that ordering tons of chemicals might. And there are a variety of new communications channels, like WhatsApp and Snapchat, some of which encrypt their data.\n\nBut more power to monitor would mean more data to sift, Mr. Joshi said, and would require more money and staffing. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t confuse powers with resources,\u201d he said.\n\nRaffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, has studied lone actors, and he said they were often known to the police \u201cbut haven\u2019t yet crossed the threshold of concern, so they\u2019re in the background, a lower priority.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe suspects in Paris were not lone wolves \u2014 like Mr. Rigby\u2019s killers or Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Oslo in 2011 \u2014 but were long-term radicals who had been largely inactive, Mr. Pantucci said.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re never the leader, never the principal, at some point you don\u2019t focus on them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t set off intelligence tripwires.\u201d\n\nIn a study of 119 lone-actor terrorists in the March 2014 Journal of Forensic Sciences, Paul Gill, a lecturer at University College London, and his co-authors found that there was \u201cno uniform profile\u201d of lone actors, although they often spoke beforehand about their grievances, beliefs and even their intention to commit violence. The study also found that their acts \u201cwere rarely sudden and impulsive\u201d and that they \u201cregularly engaged in a detectable and observable range of activities with a wider pressure group, social movement or terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nThat finding would suggest that traditional police work within target communities is vital to detecting a potential attack. At this point, Mr. Gill said in a telephone interview, there are eight to 10 such attacks a year, and he expects the number to increase.\n\nLone actors are difficult but not impossible to detect, Mr. Gill said. \u201cThere are weaknesses in these lone actors that create opportunities for counterterrorism,\u201d he said. A study that he did for the United States Department of Homeland Security found, to his surprise, that \u201cin 60 percent of the cases, the individuals had leaked very specific information about the plots they were about to go on,\u201d telling families and friends what they were going to do, Mr. Gill said.\n\nMany of them, he said, try to be dramatic so the attack will be remembered, because the propaganda value is as important as the amount of damage. He mentioned the Rigby killing, which claimed a single victim but was done in a very public space. Some of the scene and comments by one of the perpetrators were recorded and then broadcast.\n\n\u201cHe learned his script and spoke into the phone camera, with his bloody hands, and that imagery will always be remembered,\u201d Mr. Gill said. \u201cSo they provide a script for other lone actors to follow.\u201d", "summary": "After a series of attacks by individuals or small groups across Europe, governments are pressing for more powers to gather intelligence from modern means of communication like Internet sites, including social media.Similar circumstances surrounded the Frenchman Mehdi Nemmouche, who killed four people at the Jewish Museum of Belgium in June after his return from Syria, said Camille Grand, director of the French Foundation for Strategic Research.The acquisition of a weapon \u2014 even a Kalashnikov rifle, which costs less than $2,500 on the black market, much less knives and a meat cleaver like the ones used in the attack on a British soldier, Lee Rigby, in 2013 \u2014 is unlikely to set off the kind of alarms that ordering tons of chemicals might.In a study of 119 lone-actor terrorists in the March 2014 Journal of Forensic Sciences, Paul Gill, a lecturer at University College London, and his co-authors found that there was \u201cno uniform profile\u201d of lone actors, although they often spoke beforehand about their grievances, beliefs and even their intention to commit violence.A study that he did for the United States Department of Homeland Security found, to his surprise, that \u201cin 60 percent of the cases, the individuals had leaked very specific information about the plots they were about to go on,\u201d telling families and friends what they were going to do, Mr. Gill said."}
