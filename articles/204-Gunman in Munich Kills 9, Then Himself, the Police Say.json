He said the authorities were not certain that the rampage was a terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cThe events of last night and tonight make us sad, speechless, and in particular right now, our thoughts are with the victims,\u201d Chief Andr\u00e4 said.\n\nThree of the wounded were in critical condition, officials said.\n\nThe bloodshed sent this well-ordered, Baroque city into a panic, as the authorities declared a state of emergency and halted public transportation in the middle of the rush-hour commute.\n\nMembers of an elite counterterrorism squad fanned out across the city, and residents were ordered to stay indoors. In some places, pedestrians could be seen raising their hands as they walked past police officers who had their weapons drawn.\n\nGermany has been on edge all week, after an Afghan teenager slashed and stabbed passengers on a train bound for W\u00fcrzburg on Monday. The assailant, a refugee who arrived in Germany last year and who was shot dead by the police, was reported to have waged his attack in the name of the Islamic State.\n\nThat attack came just a few days after a Tunisian man drove a truck through crowds in the southern city of Nice, France, killing 84 people as they celebrated Bastille Day on a seafront promenade.\n\nGermany, which has welcomed more than 800,000 asylum seekers from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries, has been largely spared the violence inspired by Islamic extremists that has swept Europe in recent months.\n\nThe shooting Friday began at 5:50 p.m. outside a McDonald\u2019s across the street from the Olympia Shopping Center, described as the largest mall in the state of Bavaria, and not far from the scene of the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and a German policeman by Palestinian terrorists during the Summer Olympics.\n\nThe gunman, armed with a pistol, then entered the mall and continued shooting, according to the police. Most of the victims, they said, were inside the mall. Among the dead and wounded were teenagers and children, officials said.\n\nA video distributed online showed a man dressed in black firing at pedestrians outside the McDonald\u2019s. A separate video showed the same man pacing back and forth on the roof of a nearby parking deck and exchanging angry words with someone out of view.\n\nChief Andr\u00e4 said plainclothes officers had fired several shots at the suspect, but lost track of him as he fled. His body was found more than two hours later.\n\nThe police initially issued an appeal to the public not to share images or photographs of the attack, of the victims, or of police operations, warning, \u201cDon\u2019t help the perpetrators!\u201d Later, however, they asked the public to upload video or photographs of the attack to a police website.\n\nIn a parking lot at the Schwabing Hospital, Souleyman Daitzik, his eyes bloodshot, paced back and forth near the entrance to the emergency department. His teenage daughter and son had gone to the shopping mall and became separated when the shooting began. Mr. Daitzik learned that his son, 17, had been shot but did not know where he had been taken. He visited four hospitals in search of the teenager.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if my child is alive or dead,\u201d he said, as his wife began weeping. Relatives had been sent photos on their phones showing the son lying in a pool of blood, but shielded the parents from the images. The relatives also had a video showing Mr. Daitzik\u2019s daughter, wearing a red T-shirt, running and screaming, having ducked the gunfire. A few minutes later, the daughter arrived at a hospital in an ambulance, traumatized.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel will convene a meeting of her security cabinet on Saturday. \u201cIt is terrible and completely unbelievable what has happened in Munich,\u201d Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re said as he cut short a trip to the United States to return to Berlin.\n\nIn Washington, President Obama expressed support for Germany. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know exactly what\u2019s happening there, but obviously our hearts go out to those who may have been injured,\u201d he said from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. \u201cIt\u2019s still an active situation, and Germany is one of our closest allies, and so we are going to pledge all of the support that they may need in dealing with these circumstances.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama was briefed on the situation by Lisa O. Monaco, his assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

What is behind this hideous act is not completely clear; we still have conflicting leads. But already this much is clear: We will have to mourn for many fatalities and injured.\u201d\n\nThe police sent out text messages warning people to stay in their homes and to get off the streets. The mall itself took several hours to evacuate. A square in central Munich, the Karlsplatz, also known as the Stachus, was evacuated after reports of gunfire, which appeared to have been a false alarm.\n\nPassengers who landed at Munich Airport on Friday evening found themselves stranded on the curb outside. The taxi line stretched at least 40 people deep, and airport officials said that the highways leading into the city had either been closed or been subjected to tight police checkpoints.\n\nManfred Reiter, 47, a taxi driver, said he had received a call from his company\u2019s dispatcher telling him to avoid picking up customers from the street because the attackers were on the run and might try to flag a cab. \u201cHe said, \u2018Manfred please go home; it\u2019s too dangerous,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Reiter said.\n\nMiriam Arlt, who was in the area, said in an email interview that she was near the McDonald\u2019s when the shooting occurred.\n\n\u201cI only saw fleeing people and now see police and a helicopter,\u201d she said.\n\nHer roommate \u2014 who asked to be identified only as Hendrik A. because he felt traumatized by what he had witnessed \u2014 said by telephone that he had been riding his bike toward the McDonald\u2019s when he came upon the site of the attack.\n\n\u201cI was over at the shopping center waiting for the light to get to McDonald\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize the chaos or the panic that was around me. I came to a stop light, and then I first realized that things were not normal. There were three bodies lying on the ground. And my first thought was \u2018O.K., they\u2019re just lying on the ground; nothing really happened.\u2019 Two of them didn\u2019t move. One did.\u201d\n\nThen he heard gunfire erupt behind him \u2014 \u201cfive to eight shots\u201d \u2014 coming from inside the shopping center. People started to run, he said. \u201cIt was not insane panic like you would imagine, a stampede or anything, but people were a little uneasy.\u201d", "summary": "Germany, which has welcomed more than 800,000 asylum seekers from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries, has been largely spared the violence inspired by Islamic extremists that has swept Europe in recent months.
