{"title": "Le Pen and Macron Clash in Vicious Presidential Debate in France", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/europe/marine-le-pen-emmanuel-macron-france-presidential-debate.html", "body": "\u201cYou are the France of submission,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said with scorn; Mr. Macron was merely a heartless banker, in her view. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the choice you\u2019ve made, the cynical choices, that reveal the coldness of the investment banker you have never ceased being.\u201d\n\nHe leads her by 20 points in polls and is considered likely to win on Sunday. The debate is expected to move some voters, but not enough to make up for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s substantial polling deficit. She has seen some slight improvement in recent polls and was clearly hoping to destabilize her younger opponent as she did in the first-round debates, when other candidates were present. With nothing to lose and everything to gain, she went for direct frontal attacks.\n\nBut Mr. Macron generally kept his cool, laying out his program point by point through the shouting, while Ms. Le Pen, true to the scrappy, guerrilla-style party that she leads \u2014 it is stronger on combat than on policy \u2014 spent much of the two-and-a-half-hour contest attacking him. What policy proposals she offered appeared sketchy.\n\nMr. Macron offered his view of a France open to Europe and free trade, staying in the common currency, reinforcing its ties with European nations, dealing firmly with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and overhauling its stultifying and voluminous labor code in order, he said, to generate more jobs.\n\n\u201cWe are in the world,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cFrance is not a closed country.\u201d\n\nMs. Le Pen depicted a France with a \u201ctotal collapse of our industries,\u201d preyed upon by Islamist extremists, demanding ever more government protection from economic vicissitudes and urgently needing to close its borders. \u201cI\u2019m the candidate of that France that we love, who will protect our frontiers, who will protect us from savage globalization,\u201d she said at the outset.\n\nMr. Macron was a ruthless capitalist in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s familiar neo-populist depiction, ready to sell French industry down the river to hurt workers and help employers. She repeatedly tied Mr. Macron to the failed government of the incumbent Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in which Mr. Macron served for two years before quitting to start his own political movement.\n\n\u201cYou defend private interests,\u201d Ms. Le Pen sneered. \u201cAnd behind that there is social ruin.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron replied evenly, \u201cWhat\u2019s extraordinary is that your strategy is simply to say a lot of lies and propose nothing to help the country.\u201d He pointed out the weaknesses in her generous spending plans, noting the lack of revenue-raising measures to back them. \u201cFrance and the French deserve better,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t say stupid things. You are saying a lot of them.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Ms. Le Pen cast herself as tougher on the issue, reeling off a series of antiterrorism measures \u2014 experts have suggested that they are either impractical or ineffective \u2014 and saying Mr. Macron was a weakling on security. Nonetheless, it is one of her signature issues, always drawing a thunderous response when she invokes it at rallies. \u201cYou are for laxism,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou are complaisant toward Islamist fundamentalism,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to eradicate fundamentalist ideologies. You won\u2019t do it, because they support you.\u201d\n\nBristling, Mr. Macron pointed out the impracticality of expelling the thousands of people who are in the government\u2019s so-called S-files because they are considered to constitute some potential danger to the country\u2019s security. \u201cThe S-files are just information files,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cYou can be an S-filer merely for having crossed paths with a jihadist.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be much more surgical than Ms. Le Pen,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat you are proposing, as usual, is merely powder,\u201d he said, pointing out that as a member of the European Parliament, Ms. Le Pen voted repeatedly against antiterrorism measures.\n\nShe dismissed these criticisms, as she did the entire European Union project. Under her, she said, \u201cFrench laws will be superior to laws given out by some commissioner whose name we don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron posited a diametrically opposed view, insisting that France\u2019s place was in a stronger Europe that could stand up to Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia and President Trump\u2019s United States. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s idea is that \u201cwe\u2019re going to leave Europe because the others can make it, but we can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the face of this spirit of defeat, I am for the spirit of conquest, because France has always succeeded.\u201d"}
