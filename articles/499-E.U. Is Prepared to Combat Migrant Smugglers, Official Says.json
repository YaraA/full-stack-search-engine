Sutherland, the United Nations envoy for international migration, told Council diplomats that any resolution to address the migrant crisis must start with \u201cthe immediate need to save lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do not frame our response this way, it would represent a moral failure of the first order,\u201d he said.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration, a 157-member intergovernmental organization, has said that more than 1,800 people died while trying to cross the Mediterranean in the first four months of 2015 alone.\n\nA draft resolution, proposed by the European members of the Security Council but not yet circulated among all 15 members, would authorize European military operations on international waters, as well as in Libyan waters and on its shores. These actions would be allowed under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which authorizes the use of military power to enforce compliance.\n\nThe draft resolution authorizes the European operation to inspect vessels suspected of being used for migrant smuggling.\n\nCouncil diplomats have said privately in recent days that they are concerned about the approach, including the prospect of taking any action without consent from Libya.\n\nTherein lies another diplomatic dilemma: Which Libyan authority?\n\nAs for whether the European Union needs Libya\u2019s approval, Ms. Mogherini said she had met with the rival parties battling for control of Libya and sought to obtain their authorization.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She said European governments would also expand opportunities for migrants to reach the continent legally, including as refugees fleeing conflict.\n\nThe largest single group of migrants who have reached Italy and Greece in recent months are from Syria, followed by Eritreans, many of them children, fleeing a repressive government.\n\nSome Council diplomats say they want authorization from Libya, but have been vague over who would give consent.\n\nThe potential effects of destroying any smuggler boats are unclear. Migrants who make their way to Italy are packed into wooden fishing boats that are abandoned at sea. The shorter passage from Turkey to Greece is often made on inflatable rafts.\n\nIn Brussels, European Union officials said they expected to submit a proposal this week to distribute migrants across the 28-member bloc, officials said on Monday, a plan likely to encounter fierce resistance from some national governments.\n\nThe proposal for redistributing migrants would be based on a quota system that would take into account factors like a country\u2019s population, the state of its economy and its level of joblessness, European officials said.", "summary": "Peter D.
