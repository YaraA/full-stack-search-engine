Officer", "authors": ["Alan Cowell"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/world/europe/alexander-litvinenko-robert-owen-britain-inquiry.html", "body": "The inquiry into his death on Nov. 23, 2006, is being led by a senior British judge, Robert Owen, who indicated on Tuesday that hearings could last about 10 weeks and would cover Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s life before and after he fled Russia in 2000 to seek asylum with his family in London.\n\nAs he opened the inquiry, Judge Owen said the hearings would deal with \u201cmatters of the utmost gravity,\u201d including assertions in British government documents that there was evidence of Russian state involvement.\n\nHe said that he would conduct a \u201cfull and independent\u201d inquiry, although parts of it would be done in secret to protect national security, and that the two main suspects identified by the British authorities, Andrei K. Lugovoi and Dmitri V. Kovtun, would be invited to testify by video link from Russia. British prosecutors have accused them of bringing polonium from Moscow to London.\n\nThe British authorities have said Mr. Lugovoi and Mr. Kovtun were with Mr. Litvinenko on Nov. 1, 2006, when he drank tea in a hotel bar, close to the United States Embassy in London. Hours later, Mr. Litvinenko began to vomit, and he died 22 days later. Only after his death was it made known that he had been poisoned with polonium.\n\nMr. Kovtun and Mr. Lugovoi have denied killing Mr. Litvinenko, accusing the former K.G.B. officer of seeking to poison them. British prosecutors have sought the extradition of Mr. Lugovoi, a former K.G.B. bodyguard, but the Russian authorities have refused to hand him over, citing constitutional constraints.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The two men were with Mr. Litvinenko, Mr. Tam said, at a meeting at a private security company\u2019s offices where traces of polonium were later found.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nScientists who examined Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s hair samples after his death found evidence that he had ingested polonium at around that same time \u2014 two weeks before the meeting at the hotel where he was believed to have been fatally poisoned.\n\nMr. Tam also said the inquiry would call a witness from Hamburg, Germany, to testify in return for anonymity. Mr. Kovtun once worked in Hamburg, where he sometimes visited his ex-wife.\n\nDuring a meeting in Hamburg with a former co-worker shortly before he flew to London on Nov. 1, 2006, Mr. Kovtun boasted that he had \u201ca very expensive poison\u201d and asked if his ex-colleague knew a cook in London to administer it in food or drink, Mr. Tam said.\n\nThe former co-worker obtained a phone number for a cook, and telephone records showed that someone who gave his name as Dmitri called the cook on Nov. 1, 2006, from a cellphone owned by Mr. Lugovoi, potentially suggesting a direct link between Mr. Kovtun, Mr. Lugovoi and the purported conversation in Hamburg.\n\nSince Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s death, Mr. Lugovoi, a wealthy businessman, has become a member of the Russian Parliament and a television celebrity in Russia."}
