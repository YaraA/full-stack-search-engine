{"title": "With Populist Anger Rising, Italy May Be Next Domino to Fall", "authors": ["Jason Horowitz"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/world/europe/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi.html", "body": "With polls indicating that Mr. Renzi may fail, the possibility that he could resign, and force new elections or perhaps bring a caretaker government, has alarmed many leaders, including President Obama, who honored the Italian prime minister in his final state dinner in Washington and urged him to \u201chang around for a while no matter what.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIf Mr. Renzi does step aside, it could open the way for opponents who have threatened to carry the Continent\u2019s fourth-largest economy out of the euro currency zone.\n\nSuch a prospect could destabilize the shaky Italian economy; have serious implications for Italy\u2019s troubled banking system, which has been in crisis for a decade; and have a contagion effect around the eurozone.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Italian banks is they are fragile and they are really big,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Talavera, senior eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cBanks of that caliber, as soon as you have any noise and rumors, it creates a really bad loop.\u201d\n\nMr. Renzi, who captured Italians\u2019 imagination by positioning himself as an outsider who would demolish an arthritic political system, is arguing that the constitutional overhaul proposed in the Sunday referendum would streamline government and create more stability in a country that has had 63 governments in 70 years. To speed up the often clogged legislative process, Mr. Renzi wants to drastically reduce the size of the Italian Senate and make it a mostly consultative body. Critically, the Senate would lose the power to bring down governing coalitions.\n\nCritics say the proposal puts too much power in the prime minister\u2019s hands. And Mr. Renzi is showing unexpected vulnerability among the young voters who helped propel his rise but now seem to want the same job protections and social benefits their parents had more than any opportunity Mr. Renzi\u2019s changes might create. Much of the same dynamic has been playing out in Greece, Spain and even France.\n\nThe reversal has come despite Mr. Renzi\u2019s image as the Coca-Cola guzzling, Apple-gadget-pecking embodiment of young Italians eager to modernize the country. According to a poll in the newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, support for Mr. Renzi\u2019s changes is strong among voters older than 65 and weak among people younger than 45, a group that opponents of the changes lead by 20 percentage points.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe beneficiary of that erosion appears to be the Five Star Movement, with its ability to win voters on the left and right with a mix of social liberalism, economic populism and tough law-and-order talk. It has been led by Beppe Grillo, 68, a former comedian who last month called Mr. Renzi a \u201cserial killer\u201d and celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as a blunt rejection of the establishment.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent years, the merrily vulgar Mr. Grillo has stepped back so that a new generation of less rough, but perhaps no less radical, young politicians could step forward.\n\nHere in Turin, Chiara Appendino, 32, beat Mr. Renzi\u2019s favored Democratic Party candidate for mayor this year. In the election, she had the support of Mr. Roselli and many like him.\n\n\u201cOur voters are mainly young voters,\u201d Ms. Appendino said after stepping out of the chandeliered City Hall chamber. \u201cI believe there really is a generation of young people, and I feel in some way that I represent them, who have desire and ability, but who cannot get ahead.\u201d\n\nMs. Appendino, who speaks German, French and English and is considered a rising star in her party, said that she did not consider herself anti-European, but she argued that the current European Union did not work.\n\nFar from breaking with the establishment, Mr. Renzi had been co-opted by its bankers, bureaucrats and power brokers, she said.\n\nMr. Renzi is desperately trying to persuade Italians, a large slice of them still undecided, to back him.\n\n\u201cToday, we mustn\u2019t get stuck in nostalgia,\u201d Mr. Renzi told a crowd this week in Lingotto, the section of Turin that was once home to the automaker Fiat. \u201cWe must work for the future of our children.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut even his young supporters worry that those words are wasted on the Italian youth, who as in so many other European countries are often unemployed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn France, where the far-right National Front has emerged as a force, the youth unemployment rate is around 25 percent. And that looks good compared with Greece and Spain, both with more than 40 percent youth unemployment and strong populist movements.\n\nIn Italy, Mr. Renzi\u2019s 2015 labor market overhaul, hailed by many investors, has so far failed to be the boon to employment his government expected. The youth unemployment rate is still around 35 percent. In the country\u2019s south, where opposition to the change is solid, it is nearly 50 percent.\n\n\u201cThe young are lined up against him,\u201d Davide Giani, 20, said with a resigned shrug after an afternoon spent trying to hand out leaflets in support of a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the referendum only to see young Turinese turn them down. \u201cThey see this as an opportunity to lash out against the establishment.\u201d\n\nBack in the summer, Mr. Renzi predicted the gathering storm as he flew on the Italian Air Force One but nevertheless strained to see a silver lining in the unwrinkled faces of his new rivals.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that since we have come to power, there has been a generational leap forward,\u201d Mr. Renzi said, adding that his likely opponents, Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini, the young leader of the anti-immigration and anti-Renzi Northern League, would be younger than he is. \u201cGreat!\u201d he said. \u201cA sign that something has changed.\u201d\n\nSome of Mr. Renzi\u2019s older enemies across the political spectrum are latching onto the referendum to return to relevance. For them, the prospect of his premature exit has had the effect of a curtain call after a bloody opera, reanimating vengeful antagonists for a final bow on center stage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

On a rainy evening in Milan, Alessia Giuliani, 24, sat in a field office for the \u201cyes\u201d campaign hunched over lists of phone numbers she had spent the day calling in support of Mr. Renzi\u2019s changes.\n\nShe spoke optimistically about all the older people who, having lived through scores of Italian governments, proclaimed their hope and confidence in Mr. Renzi.\n\nBut asked if she had had any luck persuading young people, her smile vanished and her hand landed woefully on her forehead.\n\n\u201cIn general, the young voters are disinterested or for \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d explained her colleague, Stefano Angelinis, 24. \u201cMany young people are going for Five Star.\u201d", "summary": "With polls indicating that Mr. Renzi may fail, the possibility that he could resign, and force new elections or perhaps bring a caretaker government, has alarmed many leaders, including President Obama, who honored the Italian prime minister in his final state dinner in Washington and urged him to \u201chang around for a while no matter what.\u201d \u201cThe good thing is that since we have come to power, there has been a generational leap forward,\u201d Mr. Renzi said, adding that his likely opponents, Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini, the young leader of the anti-immigration and anti-Renzi Northern League, would be younger than he is.
