The party missed the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the German Parliament last year, but it has since won seats in the European Parliament. Two weeks ago the party gained its first seats in the state Parliament in Saxony, also in the east.\n\nIn Thuringia, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic Union emerged as the strongest party, but it fell short of a clear majority and will have to find a partner to build a coalition government in the state. The party\u2019s governor, Christine Lieberknecht, has expressed hope that she could continue to govern with the Social Democrats, who govern with the chancellor at the national level.\n\nThe Social Democrats emerged as the strongest party in Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, which the center-left party has long dominated. They, too, will have to form a new government, either with the chancellor\u2019s conservatives, or continue with their current partners, the Left Party."}
