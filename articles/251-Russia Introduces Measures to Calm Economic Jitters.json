Ivan Urgant, a 36-year-old comedian akin to Jimmy Fallon, spoofed recent advertisements for the Google mobile operating system on his late-night show with a skit called \u201cO.K., Ruble.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter not to go anywhere,\u201d the robotic voice in his telephone responds when he asks where to ring in the New Year. When he asks what the exchange rate for the ruble will be tomorrow, the phone suggests watching a video of kittens playing.\n\nThere were other signs that the government was making entreaties to Russia\u2019s business community. On Wednesday evening, Russian prosecutors unexpectedly freed Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, the oligarch owner of the Sistema conglomerate, from house arrest during an investigation of what critics dismiss as trumped-up charges of embezzlement. The accusations and seizure of Bashneft, an oil producer that he acquired in 2009, had been seen as a significant blow to property rights in Russia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was not freed, however, before Bashneft was nationalized.\n\nThe announcement drew parallels to Mr. Putin\u2019s unexpected pardoning a year ago of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the jailed Russian oligarch considered the country\u2019s most famous political prisoner, at his annual news conference.\n\nWith Mr. Putin set to speak tomorrow, his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on national television Wednesday that there was cause for some optimism for the Russian economy.\n\n\u201cIn 2008, if you remember, Putin came out and said, \u2018It is a crisis, I am assuming responsibility, everything will turn out right,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Peskov said. \u201cDid it turn out right? It did. Let\u2019s hope for the best this time, too.\u201d"}
