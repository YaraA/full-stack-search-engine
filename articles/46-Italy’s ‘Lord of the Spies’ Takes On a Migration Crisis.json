{"title": "Italy\u2019s \u2018Lord of the Spies\u2019 Takes On a Migration Crisis", "authors": ["Jason Horowitz", "The Saturday Profile"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/world/europe/italy-marco-minniti-migration.html", "body": "According to Nicola Latorre, an Italian senator and ally of the minister, Mr. Minniti was the \u201cprotagonist of the breakthrough\u201d last week, when Prime Minister Fayez Serraj of Libya requested the support of Italian naval ships to counter human trafficking.\n\nIt is a risky endeavor that Italy has nevertheless sought for years, desperate to cut the migrant flow. Its success or failure now falls to Mr. Minniti, who polls show to be a popular member of a government with uncertain chances in the next election.\n\nSome political observers have even suggested that Mr. Minniti, with his leftist background and ability to please conservatives with tough talk on security, might be a good candidate for prime minister. He has served in five center-left Italian governments, though he emphasized that he had never asked for a position. \u201cI\u2019ve always been chosen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMinniti could be a card to play,\u201d said Marco Damilano, a prominent Italian journalist who has written often about him.\n\nMr. Minniti dismissed such talk. He said he was instead more focused on countering Islamic radicalism by making pacts with local imams that required them to preach in Italian, building new relationships in Africa and working with the Libyans to defeat human traffickers.\n\n\u201cHuman relationships count a lot,\u201d said the old spy master.\n\nThe number of migrants who have landed in Italy this year totals more than 95,000, with about 2,000 who drowned. It is a crisis that has defied nearly every attempt to solve it.\n\nDespite a mix of appeals and threats by Mr. Minniti at European Union meetings, neighboring countries have done little to share Italy\u2019s crushing burden.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn particular, tensions have risen with President Emmanuel Macron of France, who has resisted accepting migrants and started an uncertain peace process in Libya that, critics here say, blindsided Italy and weakened its chances of stopping traffickers by legitimizing a rival of Mr. Serraj.\n\nMr. Minniti said that he agreed in principle with Mr. Macron on trying to reach a peace in Libya, but that a target of 2018 would be too late for him. \u201cI cannot wait,\u201d he said.\n\nHe argued that smashing human trafficking networks and investing in Libyan mayors were the best ways to stabilize a porous southern Libyan border that allows migrants from traditionally Francophone African countries to pass.\n\nAs Mr. Minniti fidgeted with a silver Casio watch, representatives of humanitarian organizations met in the ministry with officials to try to agree on a new code of conduct for rescuing migrants near Libyan waters.\n\nMore than 40 percent of migrants at sea are now rescued by private aid ships, and Mr. Minniti wants to make sure those ships are not colluding with traffickers \u2014 an accusation popular among right-wing politicians, white nationalist groups and a Sicilian prosecutor.\n\nHe also insists that it is only appropriate that the Italian police be able to board those ships, which they did on Wednesday.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMy duty is to be close to those who are afraid, to reassure them, to liberate them from fear,\u201d Mr. Minniti said, arguing that the left can no longer afford to ignore or look down on people scared by immigration or terrorism.\n\n\u201cI think fear is the crucial element of the next 10 years in democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Italy and all the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat law-and-order talk has been too much for some of Mr. Minniti\u2019s old comrades on the left. (One left-leaning newspaper suggested that Mr. Minniti thought he was Batman.) But the intense and abstemious minister said service to the state was in his blood.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In high school in Reggio Calabria, he developed a love of the ancient poet Catullus.\n\nBut his true passion was for the skies. He hoped to follow his family\u2019s tradition by becoming an air force pilot. Instead, his mother put her foot down, saying the family had already given enough.\n\nMr. Minniti said he took the ban badly. (The shelves of his office still display the models of the jets he once hoped to fly.)\n\nIn an act of rebellion, he studied philosophy at the University of Messina. He wrote his thesis on the Georgics of Virgil, and to help understand the exploitation of slaves in the ancient Roman fields, he said \u201cI used Marx.\u201d\n\nThose studies helped bring him closer to the Communist Party, and when he graduated, he said, his father showed how proud he was of his communist philosopher son \u201cwhen he didn\u2019t show up.\u201d\n\nBut that opposition only fueled Mr. Minniti\u2019s conviction as he sought to stand up for the country\u2019s democratic values in dangerous sections of Calabria ruled by one of Italy\u2019s feared mafias, the \u2019Ndrangheta (pronounced n-DRAHN-ghe-ta).\n\nIn 1980, Mr. Minniti, a free-diving enthusiast, was trying on a swimsuit when he received word that a friend in the Communist Party had been gunned down by the mob. It fell on him to tell his comrades\u2019 parents.\n\nIn the 1980s, he began working closely with the Communist Party\u2019s rising star, Massimo D\u2019Alema. In the early 1990s, Mr. Minniti \u2014 by then married to a musician, Mariangela, with whom he has two daughters \u2014 moved with Mr. D\u2019Alema to form a new political party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. D\u2019Alema became prime minister in 1998, he brought Mr. Minniti in as his right-hand man. The young aide worked at a desk once used by Benito Mussolini, and less than a month into his tenure answered a secure phone in his bedroom.\n\n\u201cI was convinced it would never ring,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Italian authorities had stopped Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, who was considered a terrorist by many, as he entered Italy. Mr. Minniti ordered his arrest, setting off on a crash course in international intelligence operations and spy craft.\n\nThe experience \u2014 followed almost immediately by his crucial role in the Italian intervention in Kosovo \u2014 gave him a taste for security work.\n\nIn 1999, he made his first visit to Libya, a former Italian colony, and began to learn about its disparate centers of power. Today he rattles off the names of Libyan towns where traffickers loom, places that he says he knows better than his native Calabria.\n\nBut whether that deep experience can resolve Italy\u2019s endless migrant crisis remains a long shot. Already, like with an earlier agreement with the Libyans that Mr. Minniti helped broker, not all has gone according to plan.\n\nEarly in the planning, a competing Libyan leader, Gen. Khalifa Hifter \u2014 whom Mr. Macron has included in peace talks \u2014 has threatened to bomb the Italian navy\u2019s ships. The Italian ambassador in Tripoli responded that such threats were useless and that the Italian mission would go ahead.\n\nMr. Minniti\u2019s ministry \u2014 eager to show its strategy is working \u2014 has latched on to a dip in the number of migrants arriving in Italy compared with last year.\n\nThe minister himself knows skepticism is high and said that when he first broached dealing with Libya, which lacked an empowered interlocutor with whom to negotiate, critics \u201claughed in my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018You don\u2019t understand the most basic thing: Libya is instable.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat he does understand, he said, is that such instability means anything can happen at any time and that any deal could blow up. \u201cBut we have built a path.\u201d", "summary": "He said he was instead more focused on countering Islamic radicalism by making pacts with local imams that required them to preach in Italian, building new relationships in Africa and working with the Libyans to defeat human traffickers.
