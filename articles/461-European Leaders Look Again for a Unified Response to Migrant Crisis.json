At the current pace, it would take more than 750 years to relocate the 160,000 asylum seekers covered by a now-expanded resettlement plan.\n\nAdding to a growing sense of urgency in recent days has been fear that Germany, the final destination of many of the newcomers, might decide to close its borders.\n\nAsked early Sunday whether this was a possibility, Ms. Merkel did not answer directly. She faces growing pressure over her handling of the crisis from within her conservative bloc, which has suffered in opinion polls because of a flood of what are expected to be at least 800,000 asylum seekers into Germany this year. Support for the chancellor\u2019s Christian Democratic Union has dropped to its lowest point in three years, according to one prominent German polling firm.\n\nRecent weeks have seen a rise in the number of far-right attacks in Germany, and the tone of the political discourse has become increasingly raw, worrying security officials and raising questions over whether Ms. Merkel will stick to her insistence that Germany\u2019s borders stay open.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMiro Cerar, the prime minister of Slovenia, said early Sunday that Ms. Merkel had assured leaders that Germany would not close its borders. Any move to seal Germany off to migrants, Mr. Cerar said, \u201cwould lead to a domino effect that would be a disaster.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Cerar, whose country has received 60,000 people from Syria and elsewhere in the past 10 days, warned at the start of Sunday\u2019s meeting that the European Union \u201cwill begin falling apart\u201d if its members could not act in concert.\n\nHe later said that pledges of action made Sunday, which included a promise to send 400 police officers to help Slovenia manage its own borders, were \u201ca first step\u201d in the right direction but added: \u201cWe must now see if they are delivered.\u201d\n\nUnlike previous Brussels meetings devoted to the migration issue, Sunday\u2019s gathering of 11 leaders included not only countries that belong to the 28-nation European Union but also others outside the bloc: Albania, Macedonia and Serbia. \u201cExceptional times demand exceptional measures,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\n\nGjorge Ivanov, the leader of Macedonia, through which most asylum seekers pass on their way from Greece to northern Europe, said 10,000 people were now entering his country each day. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stick together, we will all hang separately,\u201d he said, paraphrasing Benjamin Franklin.\n\nWarning that the flow would only increase with intensified fighting in Syria, Johannes Hahn, the European Union\u2019s senior official for regional policy, pleaded Sunday for a \u201ccoordinated and coherent answer\u201d and said that attempts by individual nations to stop the flow would only turn other countries into \u201cparking lots\u201d for stranded migrants. \u201cDon\u2019t look for individual solutions. This is not a way out,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hahn\u2019s comments signaled growing alarm in Brussels over efforts by some countries in Eastern Europe, notably Hungary, to keep asylum seekers out. A fence built by Hungary along its southern border has pushed the flow toward Croatia and Slovenia.\n\nViktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s pugnacious prime minister, sounded a characteristically defiant tone upon his arrival Sunday in Brussels, saying that he was attending as only an \u201cobserver,\u201d as Hungary was no longer part of the migrant trail. Mr. Orban repeated his longstanding position that the only realistic solution to the crisis is for the European Union to take control of Greece\u2019s eastern border with Turkey, the main corridor for those seeking entry to Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\"We should go down south and defend the borders of Greece if they are not able to do that,\u201d Mr. Orban said, complaining that he had proposed this many times, \u201cbut no one accepted.\u201d\n\nThe cornerstone of the commission\u2019s migration policy, the slow-moving relocation plan, has been stalled by bitter resistance from Hungary and other Eastern and Central European countries that object to taking in migrants for resettlement. But even a sharp acceleration of a plan to relocate 160,000 people would barely make a dent in the number who continue to flood into Europe.\n\nAccording to the International Organization for Migration, more than 537,000 migrants and refugees have crossed into Greece alone so far this year. Instead of slowing after a series of summit meetings in Brussels focused those numbers, the flow of migrants through Greece has only increased, with around 9,600 people arriving there from Turkey each day last week, the highest number so far this year.", "summary": "The European Commission, the union\u2019s executive arm, of which Mr. Juncker is the president, has proposed numerous plans and programs since the early summer to deal with the issue, but a wide chasm has opened between talk in Brussels and real action on the ground.
