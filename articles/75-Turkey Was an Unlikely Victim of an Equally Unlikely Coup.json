Political scientists, by tracking factors like economic trends, political freedoms and public health, have identified several predictive patterns.\n\nJay Ulfelder, who works in the area of political forecasting, has developed a mathematical model that synthesizes this data to predict a country\u2019s level of risk.\n\nVideo\n\nTurkey, said Mr. Ulfelder\u2019s research, done in conjunction with the Early Warning Project, was a \u201cvery unlikely\u201d candidate for a coup, he said in an email. It had only a 2.5 percent probability of an attempted coup, based on 2016 data. That placed it 56th out of 160 countries, between Laos and Iran, and was within a range considered stable. At-risk countries tend to have high rates of infant mortality, a common measurement of poverty, and poorly performing economies. Turkey\u2019s economy has been growing, and infant mortality has been rapidly declining.\n\nMr. Ulfelder has also found that a country is less likely to face a coup when there is armed conflict in nearby states, perhaps because of a rally-around-the-flag effect.\n\nWhile Turkey has a history of coups, the country has changed considerably since its last, in 1997, and Mr. Ulfelder stressed that what mattered more was its nearly 20 years without one.\n\nAnother crucial factor is what experts call elite fragmentation. If divisions open up among powerful elites \u2014 elected officials, business leaders, generals, judges and so on \u2014 their competition for resources and control can culminate in a coup.\n\nThere is, as yet, no sign of such a split in Turkey. The growing economy gives elites reason to maintain the status quo. And while state institutions are imperfect and rates of corruption could be better \u2014 both factors that can lead elites to compete for resources \u2014 neither is bad enough to cause a crisis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTurkey also does not have the kind of social polarization that disaffected elites often exploit to push forward a coup. While the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, can be a polarizing figure in electoral politics, we do not see the kind of deeper divisions, with civil society groups rallying against the state, we might expect in advance of a coup.\n\nNot what a coup looks like\n\nResearch suggests that carrying out a successful coup is a bit like baking a cake: There is a recipe, and if you skip steps or leave out ingredients, you\u2019ll almost certainly fail.\n\nTurkey\u2019s plotters didn\u2019t follow the recipe.\n\nSuccessful coups tend to be waged as \u201ccoordination games,\u201d Naunihal Singh, a professor at the Air War College, wrote in the book \u201cSeizing Power,\u201d which examines why coups succeed or fail.\n\nCoups work, according to this theory, when leaders convince other officers and soldiers that their success is already assured. That makes joining an act of perceived self-interest.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

A huge show of force demonstrates that the weight of the military is behind the coup. A public statement by one or more high-level public officials shows that there is elite support. And the plotters usually establish tight control over the media and the flow of public information, quashing any broadcasts that would undermine the sense of inevitable and unchallenged success.\n\nSuccessful coups in countries like Turkey, which have strong military and political institutions, typically follow an \u201cinstitutional coup\u201d model, according to Brian Klaas, a fellow at the London School of Economics.\n\nIn an institutional coup, the military is unified behind the takeover and uses its full power to force top-down control over the government \u2014 as senior Turkish military leaders did in 1980. In that scenario, the coordination game is fairly simple. All of the coordination by the military elite happens before the coup even begins \u2014 and then other elites have little choice but to fall in line.\n\nWhen the uprising represents only a faction of officers, Mr. Klaas said, the confidence game can also require quickly seizing top leaders and persuading or forcing a senior officer to publicly declare the coup\u2019s victory, creating an appearance of success before anyone figures out what happened.\n\nThis time, Turkey\u2019s dissident officers tried to take only some of these steps, and succeeded in none of them.\n\nPhoto\n\nRebels deployed tanks and air power in a show of force in Istanbul and Ankara, but this was not enough to intimidate the rest of the military, which eventually overcame them. Most notably, there was no public face of the coup to demonstrate elite support or issue a clear plan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe insurrectionists also tried but failed to control communication with the public. President Erdogan was able to use the FaceTime smartphone app to call a TV station, a bizarre scenario that risked the appearance of weakness but also sapped plotters\u2019 momentum and allowed him to call for the public to flood the streets in opposition.\n\nTurkish internet and cellphone service remained in operation. This allowed the government to communicate on social media and helped news of pro-government protests spread, undermining the coup\u2019s sense of inevitability.\n\nUnanswered questions\n\nThose protests \u2014 and the absence of visible pro-coup crowds \u2014 may have also been key to thwarting the plot. Successful coups will often exploit or even coordinate with pre-existing movements, using this show of popular support to rally elites.\n\nTurkey\u2019s 1997 coup leaders, for example, worked with civil society groups and others who opposed the government. Egypt\u2019s 2013 military takeover came amid mass protests against the government.\n\nThis weekend\u2019s coup leaders appeared to lack any allies. No civil society groups or political parties issued statements in support of the insurrection, and no elites appeared to take action on its behalf.\n\nThat hindsight makes the coup seem so doomed only underscores some questions. It is still unclear what prompted the attempt, who led it, and why they believed they had enough chance at success to risk their lives.\n\nIf history is any guide, the most straightforward explanation is simply poor planning and ineptitude."}
