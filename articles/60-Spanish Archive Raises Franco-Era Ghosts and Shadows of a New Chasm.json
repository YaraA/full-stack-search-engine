{"title": "Spanish Archive Raises Franco-Era Ghosts and Shadows of a New Chasm", "authors": ["Raphael Minder"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/world/europe/spain-civil-war-franco-archives.html?mcubz=0", "body": "The Spanish archive was created by a special unit designated to seize documents that could eventually help identify and punish Franco\u2019s enemies as his troops started to push back their Republican opponents. The unit stored any confiscated material in a building in Salamanca, a university town that Franco turned into his military headquarters and for which the files are named.\n\nSeveral of those who got documents back expressed disbelief at finally retrieving family belongings, as well as sadness and frustration that it had taken so long.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that personal belongings were taken away by Franco as if they were part of a war booty \u2014 and it is just as shameful that we\u2019re still struggling to recover such belongings, four decades after Spain returned to democracy,\u201d Isabel Casanovas Calvet said.\n\nShe received 17 books that belonged to her grandfather Joan Casanovas, who was the president of the Parliament of Catalonia when the civil war broke out. He died in exile in France in 1942, three years after Franco\u2019s victory.\n\nLike several other aspects of the civil war and the resulting Franco dictatorship, the Salamanca Papers remain a subject of intense controversy rather than reconciliation. Since Spain\u2019s Parliament agreed to return the documents to Catalonia in 2005, the process has been mired in legal and technical difficulties.\n\nThe issue has recently resonated even more in Catalonia, where the regional Parliament is now controlled by lawmakers seeking to break from Spain.\n\nDuring the ceremony at the Catalan archives here, Santi Vila, a member of Catalonia\u2019s regional government, started his speech by condemning Franco\u2019s repression. But he went on to note ugly echoes of the past, attacking Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz, the interior minister of Spain\u2019s current conservative government, who was recently heard in a leaked recording of a private conversation trying to dig up dirt to incriminate Catalan political opponents.\n\nPhoto\n\nJoan B. Culla, a leading Catalan historian, was among the first academics to gain access to the documents, when he visited Salamanca in 1975 just as Franco died. Drawing his own comparison, Mr. Culla suggested that returning documents stolen from Republican families was like restituting paintings seized from Jews by the Nazis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re still having such a debate shows that, even 40 years later, there is no sense of shame felt in defending the Franco period,\u201d he said. \u201cCould a town in Germany now be saying that something shouldn\u2019t leave because Hitler had put it there?\u201d\n\nPolicarpo S\u00e1nchez, a lawyer and historian, heads an association created in 2014 to maintain Salamanca as a state archive. He charged that Catalan politicians wanted to dismantle the Salamanca archive, driven by \u201cideological hatred\u201d rather than sympathy for the victims of Franco.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Catalonia\u2019s politicians, however, \u201cwant to declare independence and therefore need to erase the collective and historical memory of Spain,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. S\u00e1nchez acknowledged that Franco had created in Salamanca something akin to the files used in other authoritarian regimes. But after Spain\u2019s return to democracy, he said, the archive had been overseen by Spain\u2019s Ministry of Culture and provided a treasure trove for historians.\n\nMr. S\u00e1nchez recently unveiled some of his own discoveries in Salamanca, including the press accreditation of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, the author of \u201cThe Little Prince,\u201d who covered the civil war for French newspapers.\n\n\u201cDocuments can be found in Salamanca that the Library of Congress or any other archive would kill to have,\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cCan you imagine breaking up the Prado Museum, leaving perhaps only copies in Madrid and taking back each painting to its place of origin?\u201d\n\nMr. S\u00e1nchez is awaiting a court ruling after suing the Catalan authorities, accusing them of mishandling documents. One of his claims is that Catalonia illegally took documents from Salamanca that originally came from other regions of Spain.\n\nFew of the documents returned this month appeared to hold historic value. One exception was the boardroom minutes book of the association created in 1926 by Pablo Casals, a world-famous cellist, to give concerts for factory workers and their families.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe document is \u201cvery significant\u201d and could help others understand that Casals \u201cwasn\u2019t just happy with his own success, but also wanted to allow workers to listen to quality music in the same places as the bourgeoisie,\u201d said Jordi Pardo, the director general of the Casals Foundation.\n\nIn any case, with most of the original document owners long dead, many relatives said they might never work out exactly what they had gotten back.\n\nMar\u00eda Isabel Salazar Bertran, for one, could not decipher the dedication written in a political book that had been seized from her grandfather Joan Bertran i Llopart, a former Republican town mayor, and returned to her.\n\nAs to the emotional value of the restitution, however, Ms. Salazar Bertran said it was made more poignant because she had coincidentally been told about the book on the day her mother died.\n\n\u201cFor me, this book is in itself a symbol of the history and the dignity of my family, which, like so many others, didn\u2019t deserve to be persecuted for holding a different ideology,\u201d she said.", "summary": "The Spanish archive was created by a special unit designated to seize documents that could eventually help identify and punish Franco\u2019s enemies as his troops started to push back their Republican opponents.The unit stored any confiscated material in a building in Salamanca, a university town that Franco turned into his military headquarters and for which the files are named.But he went on to note ugly echoes of the past, attacking Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz, the interior minister of Spain\u2019s current conservative government, who was recently heard in a leaked recording of a private conversation trying to dig up dirt to incriminate Catalan political opponents.Drawing his own comparison, Mr. Culla suggested that returning documents stolen from Republican families was like restituting paintings seized from Jews by the Nazis.Mr. S\u00e1nchez recently unveiled some of his own discoveries in Salamanca, including the press accreditation of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, the author of \u201cThe Little Prince,\u201d who covered the civil war for French newspapers."}
