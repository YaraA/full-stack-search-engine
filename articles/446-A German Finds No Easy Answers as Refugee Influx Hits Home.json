Why is neither side listening to the other?\n\nThen came New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne, and the reports of sexual assaults on hundreds of young women in the city, as well as in Hamburg and Stuttgart.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For Mr. Grossekath\u00f6fer, such claims were \u201cnonsense,\u201d so he shifted gears once more, defending the media and the refugees.\n\nNow, he said, he just lives with mood swings.\n\n\u201cIt could be,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cthat everything will be super with the refugees. We\u2019ll play soccer and have street parties.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut \u201cit could also be that the police are visiting every third day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this possibility preoccupies people who live nearby.\u201d\n\nThe not-in-my-backyard feeling is augmented by another worry, he said. His neighbors, who thought they would have a say in the matter, \u201cfeel as if they are being dealt with from on high.\u201d\n\nSuch alienation is more often voiced by Germans supporting a new far-right party, Alternative for Germany, that has rapidly gained support.\n\nHamburg, Mr. Grossekath\u00f6fer said, had rejected a compromise to accommodate 125 refugees and another 125 poorer Germans. Residents sued, and a court recently halted construction in what was the first legal challenge of a federal move last fall to ease regulations so refugee housing could be built quickly.\n\nThe respite may prove temporary. Marcel Schweitzer, a social affairs spokesman for Hamburg, said the city had to appeal, because it needed the refugee housing. Reducing the number of refugees at the planned shelter near Mr. Grosskath\u00f6fer\u2019s home by 500 means that the authorities must find an equivalent number of places elsewhere.\n\nHamburg, with some 1.7 million inhabitants, needs to get 16,000 refugees out of temporary shelters like sports halls, Mr. Schweitzer added, while also preparing for a new influx, the city\u2019s share of however many \u2014 one million? two million? \u2014 might arrive in Germany this year.\n\nThe German chancellor, Angela Merkel, may hope that Europe and Turkey can now curb the flow of refugees. But down on the ground, the complex quest for compromise goes on. Mr. Grossekath\u00f6fer, a 17-year Spiegel veteran, says he feels \u201ctotally torn.\u201d", "summary": "Troubled by the din, Mr. Grossekath\u00f6fer, who had worked in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, said he was unable to shake \u201cdark thoughts.\u201d At that time, thousands of refugees were arriving daily at the Munich train station, greeted with tea and toys by well-wishers.
