He said that Britain was stronger inside the bloc and that a united Europe was in the interests of the United States.\n\nEuropean unity \u201cis under strain,\u201d Mr. Obama said Friday as he stood by Mr. Cameron at a news conference and offered full-throated support for the prime minister\u2019s campaign to keep Britain in the European Union.\n\nAt the same news conference, Mr. Obama asserted that \u201cthe ties that bind Europe together are ultimately much stronger than the forces that are trying to pull them apart.\u201d But administration aides say they share the fears among European officials in Brussels that a British vote to quit the European Union could pull a vital brick out of an already shaky structure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some divisions and difficulties between the southern and the northern parts of Europe,\u201d Mr. Obama said Friday, referring to the euro crisis and migration. \u201cThat\u2019s created some strains.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there are further tensions between Eastern and Western members of the European Union and NATO, too, over how to manage a more assertive, revanchist Russia, which has torn up the post-Cold War order in Ukraine and is trying to undermine confidence in NATO\u2019s principle of collective defense.\n\nThe economy of the European Union has been much slower to recover from the crash in 2008, making the challenge of mass migration from the Middle East and North Africa harder to handle. The confusion and popular fear that matters are not under control have undermined public confidence in Ms. Merkel and in other European leaders, while promoting populism, Islamophobia and ultranationalism among a growing minority of voters.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose same forces have also helped to stall negotiations toward a far-reaching trade deal between the United States and the European Union. Opponents, particularly in Germany, argue that the agreement would inevitably favor the interests of large corporations and cause a shift of jobs to outsiders.\n\nThousands of people protesting the trade deal are expected in Hanover, Germany, on Sunday when Mr. Obama arrives to tour an industrial trade show with Ms. Merkel.\n\nMr. Obama, whose vision of a stronger, more cohesive Europe includes passage of the trade deal, campaigned Saturday on its behalf in London, where he urged a roomful of young people to view it as a positive approach.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Muammar el-Qaddafi.\n\nThe president will be back in Europe for a NATO summit meeting in early July, when many of these same issues will be on the table, including a pronounced political shift to the right in the host country, Poland.\n\nMr. Obama has already agreed to increase the number of American troops in Europe, announcing in March that he would deploy rotations of United States-based armored brigade combat teams to Eastern Europe to create what officials call a continuous, but not a \u201cpermanent,\u201d presence.\n\nBut there are also concerns about an increasingly authoritarian presidential regime in Turkey, a NATO member that is a front-line state with Syria. Turkey is also playing an important if controversial role in preventing migrants and asylum seekers from trying to reach Europe by boat.\n\nIn the interview in the German paper, Mr. Obama praised Ms. Merkel as being \u201ccourageous\u201d in handling of the surge of migrants into Europe from Syria. The president said Ms. Merkel had \u201cspoken of our moral obligation to people, including families and children, fleeing horrific conditions, including the barbarity of the Assad regime in Syria and ISIL.\u201d\n\nThe president also used the trip to buck up Mr. Cameron, with whom he played golf on Saturday at the Grove, the site of the 2016 British Masters tournament and one of England\u2019s most luxurious courses.\n\nBut the president\u2019s intervention in the British debate over the European Union has been controversial, with a significant number of commentators saying he was overstepping. Robin Niblett, however, the director of Chatham House, a policy institute in London, said the United States was right to try to intervene after having fought two wars in the last century to keep Europe free.\n\nA British exit, Mr. Niblett said, \u201cwould potentially destabilize the E.U. at just the wrong time: when a rearmed Russia has rejected the rules-based order created to sustain peace in Europe after the Cold War, when Continental E.U. governments are struggling to manage an unprecedented inflow of refugees and migrants, and when populist parties are gaining in strength on the back of a still painful economic recession for many.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, \u201cit would leave just as the U.S. is trying to strengthen the trans-Atlantic relationship in the face of a more economically and politically assertive China.\u2019\u2019", "summary": "Mr. Rhodes said part of the president\u2019s address would focus on trade, including efforts by Europe and the United States \u201cto combat the headwinds in the global economy and promote sustainable growth.\u201d \u201cThe terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels were not only strikes on two of the world\u2019s great cities, they were assaults on the values of openness and diversity that we cherish on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the German paper, Bild Zeitung.
