Access to the tunnel was restored later on Wednesday, but the backlog of trucks and cars prevented traffic from running smoothly. The ferry workers announced that they were partly lifting their blockade, at least for some hours, because they were meeting with the French transportation minister.\n\nMr. Paulissen noted that when traffic was normal, 10,000 trucks from around Europe went through each day.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The European Union has been trying to force countries to share the burden, but the bloc has so far failed to agree on how to do so. In Britain, the issue is particularly charged, and euroskeptic politicians are pushing for the country to leave the union, with immigration a chief complaint.\n\nThe mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, said she held the British responsible for the troubles there. \u201cCalais has been taken hostage by the decisions of the British government,\u201d she said.\n\nAmid the arguments, businesses are losing millions of dollars in trans-Channel trade and thousands of travelers are being inconvenienced, for hours if not a day or more. On Wednesday, the Eurostar train service was running regularly, but on Tuesday, the service was interrupted for hours by strikers who threw burning tires on the tracks.\n\nThe labor dispute in Calais has its roots in a ruling by Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, which has a say in the transport service that runs between the two countries.\n\nThe authority ruled last year that Eurotunnel, which manages and operates the Channel Tunnel, had too much control over Channel transport and was undercutting competition. The authority ruled that Eurotunnel could not operate its ferries from Dover.\n\nAfter pleadings before the regulatory authority, Eurotunnel lost. Although it later won an appeal in Britain, it had already decided to sell two ferries.\n\nThe new owner, a Danish company, is sharply reducing the number of jobs, with at least 400 people losing their positions, said Ms. Bouchart, the Calais mayor, who added that her sympathies lay with the workers who are about to be unemployed.\n\nFurious employees began a strike on Monday after a court rejected their request to extend their contract with Eurotunnel. The strike has blocked access to the port of Calais and the ferries, and also at times to the train traffic that goes through the tunnel. Normally, cars and trucks can drive onto a freight train or can go on a ferry. With the port closed and tires burning on the tracks, it was impossible for them to get across either way.\n\nMs. Bouchart has spoken to the British ambassador and also appealed to both Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s economy minister, and Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister, to help Calais.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron of Britain confirmed on Twitter on Wednesday that he had spoken with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, about the situation. \u201cI\u2019ve called @fhollande on Calais & the need to stop the illegal blockade & maintain port security,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue working closely together.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cDrivers are fearful, and they can\u2019t do anything about it when they\u2019ve got 10 to 20 people trying to get on board,\u201d said Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, which represents 83,000 haulers in Britain.
