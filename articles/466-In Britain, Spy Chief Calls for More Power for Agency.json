The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said Friday that the Paris attack highlighted the need for airlines to share passenger data, in order to better track extremists traveling to and from Europe and conflict zones.\n\nA proposal that would grant the security services access to several years of travel data in and out of the European Union was blocked by the Civil Liberties Committee of the European Parliament because of privacy concerns. But Mr. Tusk urged lawmakers to fast-track the proposal.\n\nEurope\u2019s response to the Paris attack will top the agenda during a Feb. 12 summit meeting. \u201cThe E.U. cannot do everything,\u201d Mr. Tusk said, but it \u201ccan contribute on strengthening security.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker described the attack on the newspaper as \u201ca terrible reminder of the intentions of those who wish us harm.\u201d\n\nAbout half of MI5\u2019s investigations focus on counterterrorism, and almost all of them intercept communications in one way or another to identify plotters and plots, Mr. Parker said. \u201cIf we lose that ability, if parts of the radar go dark and terrorists are confident that they are beyond the reach of MI5 and GCHQ, acting with proper legal warrant, then our ability to keep the country safe is also reduced,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy sharpest concern as director general of MI5,\u201d he said, \u201cis the growing gap between the increasingly challenging threat and the decreasing availability of capabilities to address it.\u201d\n\nAlthough he said that the threat level in Britain had worsened, the country had not raised its terror alert level beyond its current level, the second highest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExtra security staff members have been posted at critical hubs like airports and train stations, as well as at border points with France.\n\nAn attack in Britain is \u201chighly likely,\u201d he said, adding that MI5 could not guarantee it would be able to stop it.\n\n\u201cAlthough we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Mr. Parker also offered perhaps the starkest assessment yet of the homegrown Islamist threat, citing more than 20 Syrian-linked terrorist plots against Western targets over the past 14 months.In recent months, intelligence services in Britain and the United States have publicly been campaigning against pressure to rein in their surveillance operations, notably pitting them against the American technology companies that dominate the Internet, like Google, Facebook and Apple.Robert Hannigan, the recently appointed director of GCHQ, Britain\u2019s electronic intelligence agency, castigated Internet companies in November for providing the \u201ccommand-and-control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals\u201d and challenged them to find a better balance between privacy and security.Reacting to Mr. Parker\u2019s speech, held before an invited audience, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said the government would give intelligence services what they needed.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said Friday that the Paris attack highlighted the need for airlines to share passenger data, in order to better track extremists traveling to and from Europe and conflict zones."}
