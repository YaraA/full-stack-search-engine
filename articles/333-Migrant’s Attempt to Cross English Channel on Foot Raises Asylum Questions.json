At the very least, his overhasty and overzealous prosecution should be put on hold while his asylum claim is determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine that a train would\u2019ve come off any worse, or that he would have killed anyone,\u201d Mr. Yeo added in an interview. \u201cThey seem to have rushed to charge him because they want to send a message to others not to try to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nJan Brulc, a spokesman for Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, a London-based advocacy group, contended that \u201cwhen there are no legal routes, people will take any means to enter the country.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

By some estimates, the logjam caused by migrants trying to breach the tunnel has cost Britain \u00a3250 million, or about $390 million, a day.", "summary": "The law office representing Mr. Haroun declined to speak about the case while it was pending, and details of what brought him to Europe remain unclear, making it difficult to assess the merits of a potential asylum claim.\u201cThe prosecution of Mr. Abdul Rahman Haroun for an obscure 19th-century railways offense is inappropriate and wrong,\u201d Mr. Yeo wrote on his blog on Tuesday.Jan Brulc, a spokesman for Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, a London-based advocacy group, contended that \u201cwhen there are no legal routes, people will take any means to enter the country.\u201d\u201cSo long as there are large numbers of pretty desperate migrants marauding around the area, there always will be a threat to the tunnel security,\u201d Mr. Hammond told the BBC during a visit to Singapore on Sunday.Eurotunnel said its chairman and chief executive officer, Jacques Gounon, had written a letter to Christopher Irwin, the head of the British delegation to the Channel Tunnel Intergovernmental Commission, warning against \u201csowing panic among customers and investors.\u201d"}
