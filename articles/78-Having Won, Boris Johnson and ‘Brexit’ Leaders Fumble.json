{"title": "Having Won, Boris Johnson and \u2018Brexit\u2019 Leaders Fumble", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/world/europe/boris-johnson-brexit-leaders-eu.html", "body": "In changing their tune, the leaders of the anti-European Union campaign risk undermining whatever trust they had earned from the millions who voted to leave the bloc in the expectation that immigration would be cut sharply and that money now going to the European Union \u2014 which the Leave campaign said was 350 million pounds, or $465 million, a week \u2014 would be available to help finance the National Health Service.\n\nFor example, one Leave advocate, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary, walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the \u00a3350 million a week to the health service. Instead, he said, \u201cthe lion\u2019s share\u201d of anything left from that amount after replacing subsidies from the bloc to British farmers could be available for health services.\n\nOn immigration, too, there was immediate backtracking from Mr. Johnson and Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament from the Conservative Party, who told the BBC, \u201cFrankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E.U., they are going to be disappointed.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say the change in tone may be necessary to begin reeling in unrealistic expectations about the changes the referendum could produce, but it also holds considerable political peril for Mr. Johnson and other Conservative Party leaders of the Leave campaign, especially with populist sentiment spreading and right-wing groups like the U.K. Independence Party eager to build support.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear tension between what the voter wanted and what senior euroskeptic leaders want to produce,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent. \u201cIf they don\u2019t deliver radical reforms on immigration, it would be the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the populist UKIP fire that has been burning since 2010.\u201d\n\nIn his regular column in The Daily Telegraph on Monday, Mr. Johnson tried to strike a prime ministerial tone of unity in the wake of the divisive referendum, but he emphasized continuity over change and tried to argue that immigration, clearly the primary motivation for many voters in taking a position against Europe, was somehow not a major issue.\n\n\u201cIt is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote. \u201cI do not believe that is so.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuggesting that he wants to keep some kind of open flow of people across the border with Europe, Mr. Johnson wrote, \u201cBritish people will still be able to go and work in the E.U.; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And right now, Norway pays Brussels roughly per capita what Britain currently does as a full member.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty for Boris and Gove is that Brexit feels like a column gone wrong, an academic exercise suddenly turned into reality,\u201d Paul Waugh wrote in his blog for The Huffington Post, alluding to the shared backgrounds in journalism of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove. \u201cAnd reality, particularly where the E.U. is concerned, is a messy, complex thing.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson is clearly looking to unite the divided Conservative Party behind his own, flamboyant self and to burnish his free-market economic credentials.\n\nBut playing down immigration, Mr. Goodwin said, could create more political trouble. \u201cI worry for senior euroskeptic leaders, because there is a misunderstanding of the vote, and that will feed voter dissatisfaction,\u201d he said, driving many of the voters who chose a British exit to turn away from both mainstream parties and move to the populist right.\n\nThe referendum was unusual, because it pitted a government on one side, \u201cRemain,\u201d against a loose coalition on the other, made up of Conservatives, some Labour legislators and U.K. Independence Party supporters. The Leave side never had to hammer out an agreement on how to proceed if it won, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics.\n\n\u201cThere was no coherence, because it wasn\u2019t a political party fighting for government, but an odd coalition fighting against something, but with no consistent view of what it was fighting for,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven on the economy, the Leave side was made of free-market economists who believe in no tariffs at all, those who believe in trade deals and protectionists who want to shield the declining working class against globalization, Professor Travers said.\n\n\u201cAnd now the government will have to be reformed as if it were representing the Leave side and yet represent both, a one-party government that must reflect the schism in itself,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Leave campaign\u2019s victory, the political editor for Sky News, Faisal Islam, asked a Conservative member of Parliament who supported leaving the bloc to see his camp\u2019s plan.\n\nThe legislator replied, according to Mr. Islam: \u201cThere is no plan. The Leave campaign don\u2019t have a post-Brexit plan.\u201d Then the legislator added, \u201cNumber 10 should have had a plan,\u201d referring to the prime minister\u2019s office.", "summary": "For example, one Leave advocate, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary, walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the \u00a3350 million a week to the health service.
