In addition, the European Union could eventually add to the $3.3 billion it pledged to Turkish aid organizations in November. That money was intended to help manage millions of refugees and migrants in Turkey.\n\nEuropean Union leaders had raised hopes that such a trade-off with the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, could be negotiated at the meeting in Brussels on Monday.

They say it should instead make a unified effort to help Greece and create an effective coast guard to protect the bloc\u2019s coastlines.\n\nIn Greece, a nation still grappling with severe economic problems, many thousands of migrants have become trapped because Macedonia, which is not a member of the European Union, has blocked their passage northward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Sunday, Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats group in the European Parliament, said Turkey had so far given little more than \u201cempty promises\u201d on returning migrants.
