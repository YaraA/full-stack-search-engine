{"title": "Austria, Slovakia and the Netherlands Introduce Border Controls", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy", "Dan Bilefsky"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/world/europe/europe-migrants-germany.html", "body": "While Berlin said its new controls, along the German-Austrian border, were only a temporary, emergency measure, the restrictions, a response to the strain on local communities, signaled that Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming stance toward the migrants was encountering domestic resistance.\n\nVice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told members of his center-left Social Democratic Party, which governs with Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, that Germany could face the arrival of even more migrants this year than the government had projected. \u201cThere are many indications that in this year we will not see 800,000 refugees, as predicted, but a million,\u201d he said in a letter to his party.\n\n\u201cGermany is strong and can handle a lot,\u201d Mr. Gabriel wrote. \u201cNevertheless, in the past few days we have experienced how, despite our best efforts, our abilities have reached their limits.\u201d\n\nHorst Seehofer, the premier of Bavaria, a deeply conservative state in the south, has criticized Ms. Merkel for her open-door policy. More than 25,000 migrants arrived in Bavaria over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThere is no order, there is no system, and in a country governed by the rule of law, that is a cause for concern,\u201d Mr. Seehofer told reporters on Sunday. He said that officials were straining to process and house thousands of newcomers, and that some of them were economic migrants, not people fleeing persecution.\n\n\u201cWe need better controls in general, because we have determined that in recent days, many of those on the move are really not refugees,\u201d Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian interior minister, told a local television station. Officials in Eastern and Central Europe, including Hungary, have made similar arguments.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how long the German measures would remain in effect, but Mr. Herrmann estimated that they would last \u201cat least a week.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe extraordinary restrictions to the European Union\u2019s border-free Schengen zone by Germany \u2014 one of the most ardent proponents of greater integration \u2014 signified a departure for Ms. Merkel, who had said just last week that there was \u201cno upper limit\u201d on the number of refugees her country could take in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Schengen Agreement, which guarantees passport-free movement within much of continental Europe, has been a cornerstone of European unity, along with the euro and a single market. Countries in the Schengen zone are allowed, however, to temporarily reinstate controls at their borders for security reasons.\n\nSuch controls have been set up seven times since 2013, when the rules were clarified for participating countries \u2014 but the first time such controls have been reinstated because of pressures from migration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(He added, however, that no asylum seekers had been turned back to Austria from the German border.)\n\nAustrian officials said on Monday that they were sending 2,200 soldiers to help reinforce its eastern border. Last week, Hungary sent 4,300 troops to its border with Serbia.\n\nSince the German controls took effect at 5 p.m. Sunday, thousands of refugees have been stuck in Austria. About 1,400 slept in a converted parking garage in Salzburg on Sunday night; 1,000 of them boarded a train to Munich early Monday, though it was not clear whether they made it across the border.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe scene in Vienna was calm. But at a train station there, Samin Mohebi, a migrant from Isfahan, Iran, said she had been detained for three days in Hungary before making her way \u2014 partly on foot \u2014 to Vienna. \u201cFriends and family are already in Germany,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been moving for two weeks. I\u2019ll wait one month here, but I must go there.\u201d\n\nAlthough train service between the two countries was restored early Monday, the German police were rigorously stopping and checking trucks and cars entering from Austria, leading to heavy congestion on major highways. Officers eased up as the day wore on, however, and carried out only spot checks.\n\nThomas Schweikl, a spokesman for the federal police in the Bavarian town of Freyung, said that 31 people had been arrested on suspicion of smuggling people since the controls began late Sunday.\n\nSeveral hundred officers, wearing reflective vests and flagging down trucks and cars as they entered Germany, were carrying out the checks near the border. Officers from across the country arrived overnight to help the Bavarian police, Mr. Schweikl said.\n\n\u201cThere is no way we could manage it on our own,\u201d he said.", "summary": "While Berlin said its new controls, along the German-Austrian border, were only a temporary, emergency measure, the restrictions, a response to the strain on local communities, signaled that Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming stance toward the migrants was encountering domestic resistance.
