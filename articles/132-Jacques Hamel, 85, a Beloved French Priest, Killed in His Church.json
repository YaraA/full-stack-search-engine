A memorial Mass was held on Tuesday night for Father Hamel at Rouen Cathedral, a Gothic landmark consecrated nearly a millennium ago.\n\nThe Rev. Alexandre Joly, a priest from a nearby parish, expressed horror at the killing of Father Hamel. \u201cIt\u2019s the moment when the priest is giving this act of love, that he is killed,\u201d Father Joly said. \u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible.\u201d He described Father Hamel as \u201cvery kind\u201d and \u201csomeone whom no one could hate.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThe Rev. Philippe Maheut, the vicar general of the archdiocese of Rouen, said the attack was \u201cas though lightning has hit us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in front of the town hall, Father Maheut said of Father Hamel: \u201cHe was joyous, sometimes anxious, like those who want everything to be done well. He was a humble, gentle person. He came here to be of service. What really impressed people was that, at that age, he still had the will to serve. He was fully engaged with the community, and very much appreciated. People appreciated his humility.\u201d\n\nFather Maheut added, \u201cOne can\u2019t understand these things.\u201d\n\nAnother priest in the Rouen archdiocese, the Rev. Aim\u00e9-R\u00e9mi Mputu Amba, told the newspaper Le Figaro: \u201cEven in his old age, he was still just as invested with the parish life. We used to joke around and tell him \u2018Jacques, you\u2019re doing too much! It\u2019s high time you retire!\u2019 And he would always laugh it off and say, \u2018Have you ever met a retired priest? I\u2019ll work until my last breath.\u2019\u201d\n\nFather Mputu Amba added: \u201cTo leave us just as he was celebrating Mass must have been some kind of blessing for him, despite the tragic circumstances.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.
