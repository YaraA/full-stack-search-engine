It is also a key to gathering intelligence and tracking militants from Syria who are determined to bring jihad to European soil.\n\n\u201cIt became obvious after this summer that the E.U. needed Turkish collaboration in order to have a reasonable chance of maintaining its own cohesion,\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and analyst at Carnegie Europe in Brussels.\n\nSuch a deal is particularly important to Germany, which expects to receive some 800,000 asylum applications this year. Chancellor Angela Merkel has remained steadfast about welcoming refugees fleeing the Syria and Iraq wars, but she is under pressure to slow the flow and ensure more extensive background checks on those crossing its borders.\n\nFor weeks, she and other European leaders have been courting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, but the talks have dragged on.\n\nIn return for its cooperation, Turkey wants help \u2014 3 billion euros over the next two years \u2014 to care for the 2.2 million refugees it now harbors, most of them Syrian. It seeks visa-free travel for Turks and a revitalization of talks that have stalled for a decade over Turkish membership in the European Union. And it would like a full summit meeting in Brussels to seal this deal with the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEuropeans already suspicious of admitting Turkey, a large country with a mostly Muslim population, are wary. They point to Turkey\u2019s failure to secure its porous border with Syria when the civil war erupted in 2011, increasing the area\u2019s instability in an attempt to help unseat its enemy, President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe border has remained porous, even after 2014, when Turkey reasserted more control. Europe said that has allowed thousands of young Europeans to freely cross its border to join and train with Islamic State militants in Syria \u2014 including some of the terrorists linked to the Paris attacks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the subject, said Turkey frequently obfuscated and was generally uncooperative in sharing security data, and suggested that this may have played a role in suspects\u2019 slipping through.\n\nThe Turkish authorities made their own claim on noncooperation, saying they had warned their French counterparts twice in the past year about one of the attackers, Isma\u00ebl Omar Mostefa\u00ef, a 29-year-old French citizen who was known to the authorities as someone with radical Islamist beliefs, a senior Turkish official said Monday.\n\nLatest Updates\n\nThe Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol, said Ankara had never heard back from France and only received an \u201cinformation request\u201d about Mr. Mostefa\u00ef after the Paris attacks.\n\nThe officials said that on Oct. 10, 2014, Turkey received an information request from France about four terrorism suspects. During its investigation, the Turkish authorities said they identified a fifth person, Mr. Mostefa\u00ef, and notified French counterparts twice, in December 2014 and June 2015.\n\nEuropean intelligence officials believe that Mr. Mostefa\u00ef traveled to Turkey in 2012 and probably then slipped into Syria. The Turkish official disputed that account, saying that Mr. Mostefa\u00ef entered Turkey in 2013 and that there was no record of him leaving the country.\n\nThe Turkish official said the case of Mr. Mostefa\u00ef reflected the importance of sharing intelligence in fighting terrorism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe mutual suspicion has made it difficult for the European Union and Turkey to seal a deal on hardening Turkey\u2019s borders.\n\nTurkey, sensing that it holds the upper hand with Europe, has dallied.\n\nBut the Paris attacks may have shifted the dynamics. Now, Mr. Ulgen said, the Turks \u201cshould be in a hurry because, after Paris, the E.U.\u2019s ability to deliver more is becoming severely constrained.\u201d\n\nFrance and Europe are now preoccupied with fighting the Islamic State, a cause that will take President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to Washington and Moscow next week. The summit with the European Union sought by Mr. Erdogan to seal a new deal with Europe is likely to take second place.\n\nSince the Paris attacks, conservative governments in Poland and Hungary, citing security threats, have raised new objections to taking in Syrian refugees. Populist leaders like Marine Le Pen in France, who has risen steadily in polls, are poised to gain support and could delay or block an unpopular deal with Turkey.\n\nAs that political and diplomatic struggle plays out, heightened anxiety over security at airports and borders continues to ripple far beyond Europe. In Honduras, five Syrian men carrying stolen Greek passports tried to enter Honduras but were arrested by immigration authorities at Toncont\u00edn airport in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran authorities said Wednesday.\n\nThe authorities indicated that the passports had been altered to replace the original photos with those of the men.", "summary": "Chancellor Angela Merkel has remained steadfast about welcoming refugees fleeing the Syria and Iraq wars, but she is under pressure to slow the flow and ensure more extensive background checks on those crossing its borders.They point to Turkey\u2019s failure to secure its porous border with Syria when the civil war erupted in 2011, increasing the area\u2019s instability in an attempt to help unseat its enemy, President Bashar al-Assad.Europe said that has allowed thousands of young Europeans to freely cross its border to join and train with Islamic State militants in Syria \u2014 including some of the terrorists linked to the Paris attacks.The official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the subject, said Turkey frequently obfuscated and was generally uncooperative in sharing security data, and suggested that this may have played a role in suspects\u2019 slipping through.The Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol, said Ankara had never heard back from France and only received an \u201cinformation request\u201d about Mr. Mostefa\u00ef after the Paris attacks."}
