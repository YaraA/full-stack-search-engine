In response to the fears over immigration and rising crime, Greece\u2019s two leading parties \u2014 the Socialist Party and the center-right New Democracy Party \u2014 have also tapped into nationalist sentiment and are tacking hard right in a campaign in which immigration has become as central as the economy.\n\nExperts say the group is thriving where the Greek state seems absent, the most virulent sign of how the economic collapse has empowered fringe groups while eroding the political mainstream, a situation that some Greek news outlets have begun comparing to Weimar Germany .\n\n\u201cGreek society at this point is a laboratory of extreme-right-wing evolution,\u201d said Nicos Demertzis, a political scientist at the University of Athens. \u201cWe are going through an unprecedented financial crisis; we are a fragmented society without strong civil associations\u201d and with \u201cgeneralized corruption in all the administration levels.\u201d\n\nWith what critics say is a poorly policed border with Turkey , Greece is seen as an entry point for illegal immigrants, some of them asylum seekers but most intent on moving to more promising economic terrain in Northern and Western Europe. But many of the immigrants remain in Greece or are returned there after being deported from other countries in Europe . This has stoked fears here of an onslaught of illegal immigrants, who economists say bear little or no responsibility for Greece\u2019s economic troubles but who make easy scapegoats for politicians across the spectrum.\n\nThe Socialists, who were in power when Greece asked for a foreign bailout, have seen their popularity plummet, and they are desperate for a way to reconnect with voters. This month, Greece\u2019s public order minister, Michalis Chrisochoidis, a Socialist in the interim government of Prime Minister Lucas Papademos , said Greece would set up detention centers for illegal immigrants. And the Socialist health minister caused a stir when he said that Greece would require illegal immigrants to undergo checks for infectious diseases .\n\nBut the established parties are also warning of the dangers of extremism. Last week, Evangelos Venizelos, who is running in the national elections as Socialist Party leader, warned that \u201cParliament cannot become a place for those nostalgic for fascism and Nazism.\u201d\n\nGolden Dawn is unabashedly nostalgic for both. Founded in the early 1980s by sympathizers of the military dictatorship that governed Greece from 1967 to 1974, Golden Dawn has always espoused a neo-Nazi ideology. Its symbol clearly resembles the swastika, and copies of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d and books on the racial superiority of the Greeks are on prominent display in its Athens headquarters.\n\nVideo\n\nIn the early 1990s, it capitalized on widespread opposition to the use of the name Macedonia by a former Yugoslav republic; a Greek region shares that name. And in recent years, Golden Dawn has muted the neo-Nazi talk and focused on anti-immigrant actions in downtown Athens, where the number of illegal immigrants, most from South Asia , Albania and Africa , has exploded.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe group has fostered grass-roots \u201ccitizens\u2019 groups\u201d that it says are intended to protect Greek citizens from crime by immigrants but that critics say are just vigilante squads.\n\nIn a high-profile episode last May, a Greek man was stabbed to death in Athens as he walked to his car to take his pregnant wife to the hospital. In response, Golden Dawn and other extreme-right-wing groups went on an anti-immigrant rampage that lasted for several days.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He and others said Golden Dawn had historically had ties to the Greek state, especially the police. In a television interview last year, Mr. Chrisochoidis, the Socialist public order minister, said that when he took office in 2009, \u201cguys from Golden Dawn and a number of fascist types were participating in actions that assisted the police.\u201d\n\nAthanasios Kokkalakis, the Greek police spokesman, acknowledged episodes of racist violence in Athens but said that the police force had not verified ties between its members and Golden Dawn.\n\nGolden Dawn has been running unsuccessfully in national elections since 1994, but it took a big step toward legitimization in 2010, when its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, was elected to the Athens City Council. In an interview, Mr. Michaloliakos called the group \u201cnational socialists\u201d and said it was concerned about crime and the financial crisis.\n\nHe said that the group opposed Greece\u2019s agreement with its foreign lenders and that the country\u2019s political leadership was too beholden to \u201cinternational bankers.\u201d The Nazi salutes by Golden Dawn members were not official policy, he said, adding that \u201cwe can\u2019t control thousands\u201d of people. (Soon after his election, Mr. Michaloliakos himself was captured on video doing a Nazi salute in the City Council.)\n\nAsked if he believed that the Holocaust had happened, Mr. Michaloliakos said, \u201cI think all history is written by the winners.\u201d\n\nAnother leading Golden Dawn official, Ilias Kasidiaris, was more blunt. \u201cThe main view in Europe is that six million Jews were killed. History has shown that this is a lie,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kasidiaris added that he believed that all illegal immigrants should be \u201cdeported immediately,\u201d and that Greece should plant minefields along its border with Turkey \u201cNot to kill the immigrants,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to clearly define an area that would stop anyone from thinking of accessing the country.\u201d\n\nAlthough Golden Dawn is clearly still cozy with neo-Nazi ideology, it has also tapped into rising Greek nationalist sentiment, which is now anti-German. \u201cIt\u2019s right to hate Germany, because it is still the leader of the banksters and the European Union ,\u201d Mr. Michaloliakos, the group\u2019s leader, said, using a derogatory term for bankers.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Golden Dawn is truly interested in transforming itself from a collection of street fighters into a political party. The group\u2019s leaders repeatedly refused to allow reporters to attend their party meetings, saying it would violate members\u2019 privacy. The leaders claim that the group has 12,000 members, but that figure could not be independently verified.\n\nBack at the vegetable market, as Golden Dawn members handed out newspapers, a few South Asian immigrants who work there stood quietly off to the side. A founding member of Golden Dawn, Michalis Karakostas, gave a reporter his phone number.\n\n\u201cIf Pakistanis squat your front door, call me, not the cops,\u201d he said."}
