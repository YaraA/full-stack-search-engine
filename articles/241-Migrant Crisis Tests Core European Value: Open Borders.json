Some of those countries \u2014 notably Greece, Italy and Hungary \u2014 say they are so economically stressed that they are admitting migrants with little or no processing. Many are heading for the wealthier countries like Germany, which now expects 800,000 arrivals this year.\n\nMs. Merkel, Europe\u2019s most powerful leader, has said she wants fellow European countries to take more of the migrants.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe faced an immediate challenge on Monday from the leaders of Slovakia and the Czech Republic, who said that they would seek to form an alliance with Hungary to resist any quota-based redistribution of migrants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe question is now likely to preoccupy European Union interior ministers who will meet in an emergency session on Sept. 14 to devise an answer to the refugee onslaught, the biggest to confront Europe since World War II.\n\nThe Austrian police, who on Sunday night began checking vehicles crossing from Hungary, reported finding 200 migrants and arresting at least five people suspected of being smugglers.\n\nThe Austrian authorities argued that they had no choice after the deaths of 71 migrants, whose decomposing bodies were found Thursday in the truck, which had come from Hungary.\n\nThe Hungary-Austria border is the latest in a series of pressure points on migrant movement that have appeared all over Europe.\n\nClashes erupted less than two weeks ago between migrants and Macedonian officials who had sought to close their border with Greece. British and French officials strengthened security around the 31-mile Channel Tunnel because of migrants\u2019 attempts to smuggle themselves through it into Britain.\n\nWhile thousands have drowned at sea trying to cross the Mediterranean and enter Europe, the mass deaths on the road in Austria last week showed that migrants faced lethal dangers once inside Europe as well.\n\n\u201cWe want to save lives and fight the criminal smugglers,\u201d said Johanna Mikl-Leitner, Austria\u2019s interior minister. The controls would remain in force, she said, for an \u201cunlimited\u201d time.\n\nPhoto\n\nMost new migrant are crossing from Turkey to Greece, Macedonia and Serbia before entering Hungary and then heading to wealthier northern countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe crisis has now become a priority for Ms. Merkel, who told reporters that the principle of unfettered movement among European Union member states, a freedom enshrined in what is known as the Schengen Agreement, is at risk.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t succeed in fairly distributing refugees, then, of course, the Schengen question will be on the agenda for many,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\n\nHungary, however, accused Germany of creating new complications in the migrant crisis \u2014 and encouraging the influx \u2014 with what the Hungarians described as a relaxation of restrictions on Germany-bound refugees from Syria.\n\n\u201cThe resulting confusion has often created unclear circumstances and situations which are difficult to manage,\u201d said Zoltan Kovacs, a Hungarian government spokesman, arguing that Hungary was doing its part to uphold the integrity of Europe\u2019s external borders.\n\n\u201cThe Hungarian government requests that Germany clarifies the legal situation in order to eliminate this ambiguity and controversy,\u201d he said.\n\nLast Tuesday, Germany\u2019s office for migration and refugees issued new guidelines for handling asylum applications from Syrians, stating that officials would \u201ceffectively no longer enforce\u201d the Dublin Regulation, which establishes the criteria for such cases. Consequently, those fleeing Syria now have a strong chance of remaining in Germany, regardless of how they reached the country. The change comes as German officials scramble to expand the infrastructure to speed up the handling of asylum applications, and amid criticism that they had ignored warnings and failed to prepare.\n\nThe \u201ctruck of shame,\u201d as the vehicle abandoned in Austria was labeled in a headline in the French daily Lib\u00e9ration, was first spotted on the Hungarian side of the border around 9 a.m. on Wednesday, Austrian officials said at a news conference on Monday, when they released new details about the case.\n\nA Hungarian truck driver told the police that he saw someone near the truck about half an hour later, said Konrad Kogler, director of public safety and security at the Austrian Interior Ministry. The vehicle was parked on the side of a highway linking Vienna to Budapest, Mr. Kogler said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat was not unusual in the area, where 3,000 trucks a day cross from Hungary into Austria and head west, he said. \u201cNow, of course, we see it with different eyes,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Austrian police, who have sent reinforcements to Nickelsdorf, near the border with Hungary, detained five people suspected of being smugglers and discovered about 200 migrants, Mr. Kogler said.\n\nBy Monday morning, traffic across the border, which is normally open under the European Union arrangements allowing passport-free travel, was backed up for miles.\n\nTo reinforce the point about the need for such measures to save lives, the Austrian authorities emphasized at least two more cases this month in which disaster had been narrowly avoided.\n\nOne episode, which became public over the weekend, involved a truck with 26 migrants, including three badly dehydrated children, found after the police chased a suspicious truck in northern Austria. The children were treated at a hospital and then fled again with their parents, officials said.\n\nMr. Kogler also cited a case of 86 people found in a truck west of Vienna in early August. The group included 16 children and one pregnant woman, he said, and had been crammed into a truck for 12 hours. \u201cIt was only luck that none of these people died,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also cited estimates that more than 34,000 people had been smuggled into Austria so far this year, compared with an estimated 9,800 in all of 2014.\n\nThe Austrian police have apprehended 628 people suspected of being smugglers this year, compared with 277 in all of last year, he said.\n\nAcknowledging that the new controls would clog movement along a busy artery, Mr. Kogler invited reporters to weigh the cost of human lives against \u201ca few extra minutes in traffic.\u201d", "summary": "The question is now likely to preoccupy European Union interior ministers who will meet in an emergency session on Sept. 14 to devise an answer to the refugee onslaught, the biggest to confront Europe since World War II. \u201cThe resulting confusion has often created unclear circumstances and situations which are difficult to manage,\u201d said Zoltan Kovacs, a Hungarian government spokesman, arguing that Hungary was doing its part to uphold the integrity of Europe\u2019s external borders.
