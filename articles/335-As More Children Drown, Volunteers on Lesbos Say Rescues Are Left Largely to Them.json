We\u2019re all trying to help here; we\u2019re not bad people on this island, Lesbos, we\u2019re trying to do what we can and do our duty \u2014 it\u2019s a question of humanity. But the powers that be have got to take a serious look at this crisis and solve it.\u201d\n\nPeter Bouckaert, the emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, reported that the day had taken a toll on a team of volunteer lifeguards from Barcelona, ProActiva Open Arms, who pulled some of the survivors from the rough seas.\n\nOscar Camps, one of the Spanish lifeguards, told Alberto Rojas of El Mundo, the Madrid daily, that his team of four, on motorized water scooters and in a small boat, found \u201c300 people screaming in the middle of the sea, clinging to each other to avoid drowning.\u201d\n\nHe was deeply critical of the official rescuers from the Greek coast guard and a Norwegian boat with Frontex, the European Union\u2019s border-monitoring agency. The Norwegians, Mr. Camps said, were \u201cjust cops of the sea, they don\u2019t know how to save people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe realized that they do not even know resuscitation maneuvers,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cThat cost lives yesterday.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, the Spanish lifeguard added, a Romanian helicopter working with Frontex circled the area, creating waves that obstructed the rescue. Mr. Camps, whose crowdfunded team was moved to go to Lesbos by social media images of migrant children who had drowned, was much more impressed with the efforts of Greek and Turkish fishermen, who he said \u201csaved many people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVideo of the migrants bobbing in the sea was posted online by the Norwegian police force whose ship, the Peter Henry Von Koss, later transported 120 rescued migrants to shore.\n\nWhile Frontex took credit on its website for saving half of the 242 rescued migrants, Mr. Camps said the Norwegian crew mainly watched as his team and the fishermen pulled the migrants from the water and hauled them onto their ship. \u201cAll they did is to throw ropes to the drowning, like in the movies,\u201d Mr. Camps said bitterly.\n\nHe said that some of those who had been resuscitated by his team at sea later died after they reached land, because, he said, the Greek ambulances were not properly equipped with oxygen.\n\n\u201cWe are shattered physically and psychologically,\u201d he told El Mundo. \u201cAnd I am ashamed of Europe.\u201d\n\nA Frontex spokeswoman took issue with the claim that the Norwegians who took part in the rescue were not trained in the necessary rescue techniques. \u201cThe complete opposite is true,\u201d Paulina Bakula wrote in an email. \u201cPeter Henry Von Koss, which was first on the scene, specializes in search and rescue operations with a crew trained to take part in such maritime missions.\u201d\n\nSince the ship was deployed as part of the Frontex mission in July, she added, \u201cthe Norwegian vessel rescued more than 2,000 people.\u201d\n\nLaura Lanuza, a spokeswoman for the Spanish lifeguard team, said in a telephone interview that her group did not mean to imply the Norwegians were unwilling to help in the rescue \u2014 and had obviously transported half of those pulled from the water back to shore. But the problem, she said, was that the Norwegian vessel was not designed for rescuing people from the water, and the crew was not trained in C.P.R. \u201cIt is not that they didn\u2019t want to\u201d pull people from the water or resuscitate those on the verge of drowning, she said, \u201cbut the Frontex boats are not prepared to do any rescue task in the water.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, she added, most of the migrants rescued by the Frontex mission were taken aboard large ships from small crafts used by smugglers that stalled in the water.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Lanuza said that the Spanish volunteers were first motivated by the wrenching images of Aylan Kurdi and other young children who drowned this summer. \u201cWe knew that these deaths were so near the shore, that any lifeguard could do that work of saving them,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe group\u2019s focus, she said, was not to criticize others who are trying to help, but to make it clear that the governments have sent the wrong kinds of assistance, and need to correct that error quickly, given the onset of bad weather which has made rescues from the water a daily task for the volunteer lifeguards.\n\n\u201cIt is going to get worse,\u201d she said, as smugglers continued to press migrants into large wooden boats that were either not seaworthy or too difficult for the passengers themselves to operate. On Friday, she said, her team was forced to rescue a large group from a grounded wooden ship that nearly collapsed on top of them.\n\nMs. Lanuza also described how harrowing the experience of Wednesday\u2019s rescue operation was for the team. After two of the four Spanish lifeguards had to go aboard the Norwegian vessel to provide C.P.R. she said that the jet ski operators, including Mr. Camps, nearly drowned themselves as desperate people in the water were pulling at their legs and trying to pull themselves up onto the small crafts. Overwhelmed by the scale of the catastrophe, Ms. Lanuza said, the two lifeguards \u201chad to choose who to save and who not\u201d as people in the water nearly capsized their crafts.\n\nEric Kempson, a British sculptor who has lived on Lesbos with his family for 16 years, has dedicated much of the last few months to helping migrants, who continue to arrive by the thousands day after day, even as the weather worsens and the seas grow more treacherous.\n\nIn an angry YouTube video posted online Wednesday, Mr. Kempson showed how long the line was for migrants to register, and he berated \u201cthe disgusting aid agencies,\u201d like the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for failing to take charge of the situation.\n\nDespite the presence of the agencies, Mr. Kempson said, most of the response was run by local people. \u201cThis is wrong, you know these companies, these aid agencies are making millions and millions and these people are being looked after by volunteers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Red Cross volunteers working alongside local people on the beaches of Lesbos, Mr. Kempson said, were so ill-supplied that they asked his family for emergency blankets and baby clothes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThese aid agencies, they\u2019ve got to step up their pace here,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201dWe\u2019re in Europe. You know, you might get away with this in Africa, in Bangladesh, in Haiti and places like that, but you\u2019re in Europe, the spotlight\u2019s on you and we\u2019re seeing what you\u2019re all doing. And it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nRon Redmond, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, said in a telephone interview from Athens that he understood the frustration and horror volunteers like Mr. Kempson feel. \u201cWhat you see there is ugly,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat these volunteers are seeing is shocking and extremely distressing.\u201d\n\nWhat makes the crisis unusual, Mr. Redmond said, is that \u201cwe don\u2019t normally have emergency operations in industrialized countries,\u201d like Greece, where until recently the agency had just a small national office with fewer than 10 people.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, he added, his group was not in charge of the response, as it often is in war zones. \u201cWe are trying to get the support that Greece needs, but they run this, not us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese volunteers are doing a terrific job,\u201d Mr. Redmond said. While he acknowledged that \u201cconditions are not what they should be,\u201d his agency is trying to help equip and train the Greek authorities to deal with new tasks, like setting up reception centers that can handle the influx of migrants.\n\nAt the same time, he said, money was not as plentiful as the volunteers on Lesbos might think. \u201cWe can\u2019t even get funding for our operations in Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Bouckaert, who has been trying to prick the conscience of the public by sharing distressing accounts of the crisis on his Twitter feed, said in a telephone interview that he was not convinced that Europe\u2019s governments were doing all they could. Police forces across the continent deal with huge crowds of tens of thousands of people at rock concerts or football matches every day, he said, so why is it so difficult to secure a few thousand migrants a day here?\n\n\u201cEurope has the resources to mount rescues at sea and minimize suffering,\u201d Mr. Bouckaert said. \u201cYou are left with the impression that quite a few European politicians don\u2019t mind imposing this suffering on these people to discourage others.\u201d", "summary": "Peter Bouckaert, the emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, reported that the day had taken a toll on a team of volunteer lifeguards from Barcelona, ProActiva Open Arms, who pulled some of the survivors from the rough seas.Oscar Camps, one of the Spanish lifeguards, told Alberto Rojas of El Mundo, the Madrid daily, that his team of four, on motorized water scooters and in a small boat, found \u201c300 people screaming in the middle of the sea, clinging to each other to avoid drowning.\u201dLaura Lanuza, a spokeswoman for the Spanish lifeguard team, said in a telephone interview that her group did not mean to imply the Norwegians were unwilling to help in the rescue \u2014 and had obviously transported half of those pulled from the water back to shore.The group\u2019s focus, she said, was not to criticize others who are trying to help, but to make it clear that the governments have sent the wrong kinds of assistance, and need to correct that error quickly, given the onset of bad weather which has made rescues from the water a daily task for the volunteer lifeguards.In an angry YouTube video posted online Wednesday, Mr. Kempson showed how long the line was for migrants to register, and he berated \u201cthe disgusting aid agencies,\u201d like the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for failing to take charge of the situation."}
