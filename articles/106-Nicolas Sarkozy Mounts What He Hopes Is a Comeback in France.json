Mr. Sarkozy is positioning himself as its No. 1 defender against weak Socialists and competitors on the right.\n\nWith his exclamations, Mr. Sarkozy is all about ensuring that next year\u2019s presidential campaign will be fought largely over the threat from Islam, real and perceived. Already, he has touched a nerve with voters.\n\nFor months, the calm, cerebral and moderate mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9, with his soothing talk of a France at ease with what he calls its \u201chappy identity,\u201d has been considered the front-runner, easily pushing Mr. Sarkozy and the bedraggled Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, way back in polls. Mr. Jupp\u00e9 is still the favorite, but he is losing ground in his own party.\n\nThe new polling numbers suggest as much: Mr. Sarkozy gained four points last week in one widely watched measure and two points in another, nipping steadily at Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s heels. In one of the polls, he was nearly 40 points ahead of Mr. Jupp\u00e9 among voters in their party, the Republicans.\n\nMr. Sarkozy recently said he would introduce a law banning the burkini, the full-body swimsuit worn by some Muslim women, and it has not hurt him. Anything but. Even on the French left, the burkini has few defenders. The Socialist government\u2019s female ministers have been quick to say they are against it, even when they do not support a total ban; feminists have published diatribes against it in the French news media.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s appeal, to preserve republican values and the rule of law, seems less in tune with the voters in France\u2019s moment of sustained tension.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, oddly silent after its defeat in local elections in December and largely absent from public debate, Mr. Sarkozy seems intent on scooping up both the Front\u2019s security-minded, xenophobic electorate and more centrist right-leaning voters who, like much of France, are still in a state of shock after a wave of terrorist attacks. So far, he appears to have the wind in his sails.\n\nHow is it that Mr. Sarkozy \u2014 a politician who left France\u2019s chronic economic problems intact after five years in office, embarrassed it with a messy personal life, and wound up being interrogated by investigators over party finances and other matters \u2014 appears to be coming back so strongly?\n\nMuch of it has to do with France\u2019s party-based, Paris-oriented political system, said G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a political scientist at the Institute of Political Studies. Such a system leaves little opening for outsiders and newcomers. Those who are strong in their parties can almost always be guaranteed a long political life. If you are already in the club, you stay in it.\n\nEven in defeat, Mr. Sarkozy maintained firm control of his Republicans, not stepping down from their leadership until he announced his candidacy on Aug. 22.\n\nAnd although the French president is directly elected, not chosen by Parliament, the office exists in the shadow of the country\u2019s long parliamentary tradition, Mr. Grunberg said. In that tradition, \u201cthe fact of having been beaten did not mean the end,\u201d he said, with prime ministers and other top leaders often recycling themselves after losing crucial votes.\n\nBut perhaps more important, Mr. Sarkozy may be the politician most in tune with the country\u2019s unease. He is certainly the loudest, pounding even more explicitly than Ms. Le Pen the themes of secularism and the need to oppose the influence of Islam.\n\n\u201cThe Republic has retreated too far,\u201d Mr. Sarkozy says in his book. \u201cNobody should be allowed any external sign of religious affiliation.\u201d\n\nHe adds that it is \u201cnot with religions that the Republic has problems, but with one of them.\u201d\n\nIn the face of the terrorist attacks, Mr. Sarkozy projects aggression and pugnacity where Mr. Hollande merely looks stricken and concerned. Among the voters, \u201cSarkozy responds to a demand for authority\u201d in a \u201cvery tense, dangerous situation,\u201d Mr. Grunberg said. \u201cHe\u2019s decided to go very far to the right. And Jupp\u00e9 hasn\u2019t said anything, though now he is beginning to speak.\u201d\n\nWhether Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s \u201ctranquillity\u201d in the face of the threat can sway voters \u2014 Mr. Grunberg believes it might \u2014 is an open question. Mr. Sarkozy, he pointed out, remains unpopular with a broad portion of the electorate."}
