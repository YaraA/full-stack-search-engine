{"title": "A New Wave of Popular Fury Could Hit Europe in 2017", "authors": ["Alissa J. Rubin"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/world/europe/europe-election-populism-germany-france-italy.html", "body": "\u201cThe U.K. was always one foot in and one foot out,\u201d he said. \u201cItaly is a founding member state, fully integrated into the union\u2019s political and economic structure. This is existential for the E.U.\u201d\n\nThe Italian electorate rejected a constitutional overhaul that, among other changes, would have increased the power of the prime minister by reducing the number of senators and decreasing their power. The political impact of the rejection lies less in any direct effect on policies than in the opening it provides for the populist Five Star movement, which campaigned against the constitutional changes. It also brought the resignation of Mr. Renzi, a strong supporter of the European Union who was working hard to stabilize some of Italy\u2019s shakiest banks.\n\nThe popular anger has turned what are normally routine elections into what Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a former French defense official and the chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, described as moments of \u201cvolatility and inscrutability.\u201d\n\nThat is especially so with yes-or-no referendums \u2014 first in Britain, now in Italy \u2014 where a populist rejection of the political establishment can, by extension, also be a chance to send a message to the unelected officials in Brussels who work closely with European government leaders.\n\nIn that context, Mr. Heisbourg said, the anti-European Union sentiment \u201cis just a handle for the sense of a loss of control, a loss of agency\u201d that people feel.\n\n\u201cIn Britain, one of the campaign slogans for Brexit was \u2018Vote Leave, Take Control,\u2019\u201d he noted. \u201cThe idea was the E.U. was preventing Britons from doing that. The E.U. is the pi\u00f1ata for populism.\u201d\n\nThe motivation for voters in Britain and Italy was much the same as that for American voters who backed Donald J. Trump: to drive home to the elite that the status quo was unacceptable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCompounding the frustration on both continents, and especially in Europe, are the lingering effects of the global recession of 2008, from which many European countries never fully recovered.\n\n\u201cThe social contract that we, the West, signed up to \u2014 Europe, the United States \u2014 no longer adds up,\u201d for people, said Xenia Wickett, who oversees the United States and the Americas program for the research institution Chatham House.\n\n\u201cThe population is aging, we have far more older people relying on the younger ones for support, productivity is slowing, we haven\u2019t been investing in our infrastructure and education,\u201d Ms. Wickett said. \u201cYou have the disenfranchised saying, \u2018That doesn\u2019t work for us.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn France, for example, economic growth barely reached 1 percent last year. Youth unemployment there still hovers near 25 percent. (In Italy, Spain and Greece, it is even higher.) Older and less educated workers feel overwhelmed by an economy that seems to have left them behind.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe Rust Belt isn\u2019t just in America \u2014 there\u2019s a Rust Belt in the north of France,\u201d said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, the director of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund. \u201cThey feel they are the dispossessed, dispossessed of their country\u2019s sovereignty and of their economy.\u201d\n\nFar from easing those anxieties, membership in the European Union is blamed for exacerbating them. And the austerity regime that Brussels officials and international lenders have demanded, especially across southern Europe, has fueled anger still more.\n\nThe Italian vote will probably widen the gulf between the northern eurozone countries, led by Germany, and those in the south, said Pawel Tokarski, a senior researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Instead, he may be remembered for creating an opening for politicians who are openly hostile to Europe and the euro.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe way Washington is perceived by many American people is the way many French or Germans or Italians perceive Brussels,\u201d Ms. de Hoop Scheffer said. \u201cThey perceive Brussels as almost an illegitimate entity.\u201d\n\nThe old center-right and center-left parties that divided power in a number of countries and kept Europe stable for decades are being swept aside by new and unpredictable forces nearly across the board. Politicians who play on nationalism and worries about economic disenfranchisement are on the rise. Animosity toward the European Union is of a piece with this feeling.\n\n\u201cRight versus left doesn\u2019t exist any more,\u201d Mr. Wilders, who is regularly rated as the most popular politician in the Netherlands, said in an interview.\n\nMany voters on both sides of the Atlantic seem fed up with the old political names and faces, like Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush in the United States.\n\nIn France, the list includes the former president Nicolas Sarkozy and another center-right figure, Alain Jupp\u00e9, who are both out of the 2017 presidential race, as well as the current Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who decided not to seek a second term because his approval ratings were so poor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith so many major elections on the way and so few of the big questions settled, Europe seems destined to continue to be subject to political tremors \u2014 and vulnerable to stronger forces that risk fracturing the European Union altogether.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is to bring back the values, the identity, the culture and the money, and put forward again national interests,\u201d Mr. Wilders said.\n\nWhether such changes are possible is hard to know, but Europe\u2019s populists would clearly like to project an air of inevitability.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, the genie will not go back into the bottle,\u201d Mr. Wilders said. \u201cThe process will continue, and will change Europe forever.\u201d", "summary": "The popular anger has turned what are normally routine elections into what Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a former French defense official and the chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, described as moments of \u201cvolatility and inscrutability.\u201dThat is especially so with yes-or-no referendums \u2014 first in Britain, now in Italy \u2014 where a populist rejection of the political establishment can, by extension, also be a chance to send a message to the unelected officials in Brussels who work closely with European government leaders.The Italian vote will probably widen the gulf between the northern eurozone countries, led by Germany, and those in the south, said Pawel Tokarski, a senior researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.The political demise of Mr. Renzi, the Italian prime minister, and his reform agenda removes an unabashedly pro-European leader who had hoped to ignite economic growth by ending an era of crippling budget austerity.With so many major elections on the way and so few of the big questions settled, Europe seems destined to continue to be subject to political tremors \u2014 and vulnerable to stronger forces that risk fracturing the European Union altogether."}
