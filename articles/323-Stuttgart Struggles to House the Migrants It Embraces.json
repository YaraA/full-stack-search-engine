Stuttgart doesn\u2019t have ethnic enclaves. After World War II, Mercedes and Bosch erected hostels for guest workers. But by the 1970s, when Manfred Rommel became mayor, political and business leaders adopted a different tack, integrating migrants into existing communities in the city center. Stuttgart embraced a melting pot urbanism.\n\nWilfried Porth, a member of the Daimler board and director of the company\u2019s labor relations, recalls Stuttgart as a dour place years ago.\n\n\u201cThen Italians and Spaniards and Turks brought cafe life to the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cPhysically, tangibly, this became a much friendlier, more open city.\u201d\n\nAsk Us Your Questions About the Refugee Crisis in Europe What would you like to know about the refugee crisis in Europe? * You have 250 characters left.

The hope is to avoid the mistake that West German and other European cities have made, enabling a kind of parallel culture of alienated guest workers to occupy isolated pockets of cities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe need, as quickly as possible, to integrate refugees into neighborhoods and provide them with skills and the capability to afford housing here,\u201d Mr. Porth said.\n\nThat said, Daimler is not in the housing business, and Stuttgart, like Berlin, New York, London and Paris, faces a housing shortage.\n\nCity leaders want to fight sprawl, but sky-high construction costs, Europe-wide environmental regulations that discourage tall buildings, an inviolable green belt around the city center and little land in public hands all make building new apartments here a struggle.\n\nPhoto\n\nMaybe the biggest long-term hurdle, though, is that Stuttgart needs new thinking about the shape and mix of its apartments.\n\nA disproportionate amount of new housing across the country is built for nuclear families, but according to the German Federal Institute of Demography, more than half of German city dwellers live alone. In \u201cLiving Complex,\u201d Niklas Maak, an author and architecture critic for The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, points out that nuclear families today account for only 14 percent to 20 percent of households in big German cities like Berlin and Munich \u2014 \u201calmost a marginal group,\u201d he notes, and yet \u201cthis social development is hardly reflected in housing policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe forms of housing offered to the residents of a city have less and less to do with the life that takes place in them,\u201d Mr. Maak concludes. The influx of Muslim migrants who will want housing for extended families tips the scales even further out of whack.\n\nChristine Tritschler is a young urban planner in Stuttgart. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis the refugees don\u2019t create but make more acute,\u201d she said. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been nearly enough thinking about new housing types. More and more people want to live in the city center \u2014 workers, students, families, older people \u2014 in ways that current housing strategies don\u2019t address.\u201d\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t unique to Stuttgart. After reunification, Berlin\u2019s housing glut made that city a magnet for young people. A bounty of big, cheap apartments propelled Berlin\u2019s culture scene, but this accelerated gentrification. City officials failed to notice when the housing surplus became a deficit. Now Berlin\u2019s leaders are scrambling to provide 6,000 or more new affordable units a year. But what kind?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA couple of recent housing projects by young architects there rethink the economics and configurations of apartment buildings. The designers \u2014 Ifau and Jesko Fezer, Heide & Von Beckerath \u2014 recently completed a six-story block called R50, with timber facade and wraparound balconies: a low-cost communal development that stressed shared spaces and flexible units. At the moment, Syrian refugees are occupying some of those shared spaces.\n\nThe other project, called Spreefeld, is the work of a team of firms, Carpaneto, Fatkoehl and BAR. It mixes communal living with commercial and nonprofit offices, public green space and ground-floor common rooms. Refugees have found a haven in Spreefeld, too. The goal of the developer, Christian Sch\u00f6ning, is an affordable, adaptable, collaborative housing model, built in consultation with the neighborhood. It costs less per square foot to construct than what Berlin officials say is the city\u2019s least expensive new public housing. Just as important, the flexible, communal housing provides a potential model for a growing population of Muslim migrants with extended families who don\u2019t fit the nuclear model.\n\n\u201cWe have to start thinking ahead 10 to 20 years,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00f6ning said. \u201cWe can\u2019t only focus on the immediate crisis, because the population is changing the way we live, and this is a long-term issue.\u201d\n\nIn Stuttgart, Isabel Fezer, a deputy mayor, echoed the thought: \u201cSocial and urban challenges go together,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this city, we have lots of practice integrating people and have had few migrant-specific troubles as a result, but if we can\u2019t house everybody, then we will have social problems. Housing is the No. 1 issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe migrants are a challenge and an opportunity,\u201d she added. \u201cAt this point, they\u2019re both. But they are here to stay.\n\n\u201cSo we must make sure this becomes an opportunity, because it is our future.\u201d", "summary": "But by the 1970s, when Manfred Rommel became mayor, political and business leaders adopted a different tack, integrating migrants into existing communities in the city center.
