But with its capital paralyzed and its political elite pointing fingers over who is to blame for letting jihadists go unchecked, the country is again being ridiculed as the world\u2019s most prosperous failed state.\n\nAn Italian newspaper called it \u201cBelgistan,\u201d and a German one declared Belgium \u201ckaput.\u201d A French writer, \u00c9ric Zemmour, suggested in a recent radio interview that instead of bombing Raqqa, Syria, the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State, \u201cFrance should bomb Molenbeek.\u201d\n\nBelgians, accustomed to being derided, particularly by the French, have, in the main, not risen to the bait, although the editor in chief of the newspaper La Libre, Francis Van de Woestyne, complained on Tuesday that \u201cFrench condescension has no limits.\u201d But Belgians, too, are wondering what went wrong in Molenbeek and in the system as a whole.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Political Maze\n\nWith three uneasily joined populations, Belgium has a dizzying plethora of institutions and political parties divided along linguistic, ideological or simply opportunistic lines, which are being blamed for the country\u2019s seeming inability to get a handle on its terrorist threat.\n\nIt was hardly difficult to find the two Molenbeek brothers before they helped kill 130 people in the Paris assaults: They lived just 100 yards from the borough\u2019s City Hall, across a cobblestone market square in a subsidized borough-owned apartment clearly visible from the mayor\u2019s second-floor corner office. A third brother worked for Ms. Schepmans\u2019s borough administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMuch more difficult, however, was negotiating the labyrinthine pathways that connect \u2014 and also divide \u2014 a multitude of bodies responsible for security in Brussels, a capital city with six local police forces and a federal police service.\n\nBrussels has three Parliaments, 19 borough assemblies and the headquarters of two intelligence services \u2014 one military, one civilian \u2014 as well as a terrorism threat assessment unit whose chief, exhausted and demoralized by internecine turf battles, resigned in July but is still at his desk.\n\nLost in the muddle were the two brothers, Ibrahim Abdeslam, who detonated a suicide vest in Paris, and Salah, who is the target of an extensive manhunt that has left the police flailing as they raid homes across the country, so far without results.\n\nTo the system\u2019s rising chorus of critics, the scale of the lockdown itself \u2014 the security alert has closed schools, many shops and the subway system in Brussels \u2014 is a reflection less of focused authority and actionable intelligence than of diffuse incoordination.\n\nOf 16 people detained in a huge sweep on Sunday evening, 15 were promptly released. No explosives or guns were found, a blow to efforts to avoid what the federal government asserts is a \u201cserious and imminent\u201d threat of Paris-style terrorism.\n\nLars Bov\u00e9, the author of a book on the Belgian security system, said that cooperation between different layers of government and different security services was improving but that information sharing remained a problem, particularly between federal agencies and local authorities.\n\nResponsibilities, he said, \u201ctend to overlap,\u201d with only fuzzy rules for who is supposed to do what.\n\nMuriel Targnion, the mayor of the eastern town of Verviers, where the federal police stormed a terrorist safe house in January, said she had been told by security services in Brussels that her town had 34 residents suspected as jihadists. But that was all she was allowed to know.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAll I was given was a number,\u201d she said. \u201cNo names, no addresses. Nothing.\u201d\n\nHistory of Rivalries\n\nVideo\n\nInformation sharing does not come easy in a country with fierce rivalries between groups that, in some cases, cannot talk to each other, at least not in a common language.\n\nOn top of language, said Sus van Elzen, a Flemish writer and former political magazine editor, \u201cit is in our genes to reject all centralizing power\u201d and, on all sides of the linguistic divide, to mistrust outsiders.\n\nBelgium\u2019s history, he added, is a \u201cvery unhappy story\u201d of constant retreat from intruding forces, notably the Spanish, the French and the Germans, that have sought to impose a centralized order.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The chief languages, Dutch and French, became instruments of those in power, and both fell in and out of favor. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the Congress of Vienna made the largely Roman Catholic Belgium part of Holland, which was ruled by a Protestant king. The union led to unrest, and eventually rebellion, and in 1831 another gathering of Europe\u2019s great powers established the kingdom of Belgium.\n\nToday centralized order hardly seems the problem, except when it comes to tracking terrorists. Even if intelligence professionals all speak Belgium\u2019s two main languages, they are still divided into feuding fiefs.\n\nLuc Verheyden, a veteran intelligence officer who in 2006 helped set up OCAD, a coordinating agency for threat analysis, resigned four years later, citing his frustration over the refusal of the police and other security services to cooperate.\n\n\u201cThe creation of OCAD was not appreciated by certain services because it forced them to share information,\u201d he told the Belgian news media when he quit. \u201cThey were waiting around the corner for revenge,\u201d he added.\n\nOCAD\u2019s chief and Mr. Verheyden\u2019s former boss, Andr\u00e9 Vandoren, resigned in July after political sniping and complaints from a secretive parliamentary committee that he had trespassed onto intelligence gathering turf that belonged to S\u00fbret\u00e9 de l\u2019Etat, Belgium\u2019s more established intelligence service.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEverything in Belgium is politicized; you cannot have an administrative function, particularly a senior one, if you don\u2019t have a political affiliation,\u201d said Claude Moniquet, a former French intelligence officer who runs a risk analysis company in Brussels.\n\nLanguage Divisions\n\nLanguage divisions might not prevent intelligence experts from communicating, but they shape the political environment in which the experts operate and decide who fills the ministerial positions that set their priorities.\n\nMr. Jambon, the Flemish nationalist interior minister, has infuriated many French-speaking Belgians with what they see as insinuation that they alone are to blame for the growth of Islamic militancy in Belgium.\n\n\u201cThe link that has again been established between terrorism and our country forces us to look into the mirror,\u201d Mr. Jambon said two days after the Paris attacks. The reflection he saw, however, was heavily filtered by the lens of Belgium\u2019s tribal politics.\n\n\u201cThe question I ask myself is: Why did we succeed to eradicate radicalism in Antwerp and other Flemish cities, and why doesn\u2019t it work in Brussels?\u201d he said, contrasting his Dutch-speaking region of Flanders with Belgium\u2019s mostly French-speaking capital.\n\nAntwerp, the largest city in Flanders, has cracked down on Islamic extremists. This year the city was the site of Belgium\u2019s biggest terrorism trial, with more than 40 defendants accused of traveling to fight in Syria or of encouraging others to do so.\n\nBut the trial was held in Dutch-speaking Antwerp only because that was where its principal defendant, Fouad Belkacem, and the now-banned organization he led, Sharia4Belgium, a well-known recruiter for jihad, had operated for years.\n\nFrom there, Mr. Belkacem reached out to French-speaking areas, notably Molenbeek, where in 2012 he organized a rally outside a police station to protest the arrest of a woman wearing an Islamic head covering.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore the trial, when he was sentenced to 12 years for supporting terrorism, Mr. Belkacem was \u201cvery active here,\u201d Ms. Schepmans said, and he set alarm bells ringing about the dangers of extremism.\n\nThe federal authorities were so worried that they offered to help Molenbeek with money to set up a unit to combat radicalization. But the money offered was paltry \u2014 initially 40,000 euros, or about $42,500, and later \u20ac60,000. The borough found funding from its own budget and the radicalization unit now has four employees. Only one speaks Arabic.\n\nMolenbeek\u2019s police force, housed in a big concrete block adjoining City Hall, knows the neighborhood and its residents, but the mayor said that it \u201chas neither the means nor the powers\u201d to keep tabs on Islamic militant suspects.\n\nArthur van Amerongen, a Dutch writer on the Middle East who lived in Molenbeek a decade ago while doing research for a book on Islamic extremism, said it had been obvious for years, particularly under a Socialist mayor who governed until 2012, that militants were making inroads there, but \u201cnobody wanted to know because this did not fit their political agenda.\u201d\n\nNeither local authorities nor the central government showed interest, Mr. van Amerongen said, noting that his book, \u201cBrussel: Eurabia,\u201d was greeted with accusations of racism and bias against French-speaking Molenbeek.\n\nIntelligence services, too, have struggled with the same political calculations and constraints.\n\nWhile long derided for its often chaotic and fractious ways, Belgium is if anything \u201coverorganized,\u201d with so many overlapping bodies and agencies that nobody is ever really in charge, said Hubert van Humbeeck, a Belgian political commentator. \u201cIt works more or less normally, but when something so unpredictable like terrorism happens, all the institutions collide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the Belgium disease,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone always says it is not their fault, and they are often right.\u201d", "summary": "Flemish nationalists, ever eager to show that Belgium in its current form does not work, have jumped on the mess, with Karl Vanlouwe, a member of the Belgian Senate, writing in the newspaper Le Soir on Tuesday that \u201c20 years of laxity\u201d by the French-speaking Socialist Party had turned Brussels into a \u201crear base of Islamic barbarity.\u201dThe perennial dysfunctions of a small country with just 11.2 million people would not normally transcend its borders, but they are now blamed for having helped turn Belgium into a hub of terrorist activity that is threatening lives as well as the Continent\u2019s troubled enterprise of integration and intelligence sharing.It was hardly difficult to find the two Molenbeek brothers before they helped kill 130 people in the Paris assaults: They lived just 100 yards from the borough\u2019s City Hall, across a cobblestone market square in a subsidized borough-owned apartment clearly visible from the mayor\u2019s second-floor corner office.Brussels has three Parliaments, 19 borough assemblies and the headquarters of two intelligence services \u2014 one military, one civilian \u2014 as well as a terrorism threat assessment unit whose chief, exhausted and demoralized by internecine turf battles, resigned in July but is still at his desk.Arthur van Amerongen, a Dutch writer on the Middle East who lived in Molenbeek a decade ago while doing research for a book on Islamic extremism, said it had been obvious for years, particularly under a Socialist mayor who governed until 2012, that militants were making inroads there, but \u201cnobody wanted to know because this did not fit their political agenda.\u201d"}
