The sole window between the driver\u2019s seat and the back of the van had been blacked out and closed, he said.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cIn effect, it was a jail cell,\u201d said Mr. Keiblinger, who described photographs showing the Afghans, all ages 16 to 20, standing and kneeling in the van. \u201cThey had no air; it was basically a situation of life or death.\u201d\n\nHe said the Afghans reported being herded into the vehicle by an accomplice of the driver. They did not say where this happened, but Mr. Keiblinger said it was most likely in Hungary, close to the border, which is about an hour\u2019s drive from Vienna.\n\nThe police here became suspicious of the vehicle around midnight on Monday and began to chase the van. The van was forced off a highway and onto Vienna streets, where the driver eventually stopped and ran away, Mr. Keiblinger said.\n\nThe driver did not stop even after an officer fired a warning shot into the ground, Mr. Keiblinger said.\n\nA police dog named Iceman picked up the driver\u2019s scent and led officers to a shopping center where they arrested the suspect, described as a 30-year-old Romanian man.\n\nMr. Keiblinger indicated that the 24 Afghans would probably join the many migrants heading for Germany. They all declined to apply for asylum in Austria, he said, and were freed after the police gave them food and drink and questioned them.\n\nSince Austria stepped up police action late Sunday, officers in the eastern province of Burgenland, which borders Hungary, have arrested 24 suspected smugglers and freed hundreds of migrants stashed in vehicles, a police spokesman, Helmut Marban, told Austria Press Agency. On Sunday alone, 239 migrants were freed, followed by 307 on Monday and 305 on Tuesday, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Vienna, according to the police, four suspected traffickers were arrested on Monday and Tuesday. In the first case, the police freed eight people \u2014 four men, two women and two girls, all said to have been from Iraq \u2014 from two vehicles with Swedish license plates. A Canadian and a Serbian citizen were detained. In the second, a 47-year-old Serb was arrested after the police stopped his vehicle \u2014 specially adapted to hide people \u2014 and freed 10 Iraqis.\n\nAustria\u2019s interior minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, visited the police station where the van carrying the 24 Afghans was stored and pronounced the traffickers \u201cimpossible, and inhuman.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On the same evening, prominent and ordinary Austrians flocked to St. Stephen\u2019s Cathedral for a Mass led by Archbishop Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, the head of the country\u2019s Roman Catholic Church, in memory of the 71 people, including three boys and a little girl, found dead last week.", "summary": "Austria\u2019s interior minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, visited the police station where the van carrying the 24 Afghans was stored and pronounced the traffickers \u201cimpossible, and inhuman.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us can imagine what fear the people in this transport had to live through,\u201d said Ms. Mikl-Leitner, who planned to visit Macedonia and meet her Balkan counterparts on Friday to get a picture of how many migrants are still massed along their hoped-for route to Europe, and what action is feasible.
