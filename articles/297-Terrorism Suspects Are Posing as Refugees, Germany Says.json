On Jan. 10, the agency gave an unspecified tip that involved suspected supporters of ISIS possibly involved in planning an attack in Berlin, a police statement said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

About 300 of the 450 police officers involved in Thursday\u2019s raids were deployed in Berlin, where four homes and two businesses were searched. The other raids were in Attendorn and in Hanover.\n\nIn Berlin, the police arrested an Algerian, 49, who they said had lived in the German capital since 2000 under various identities. He left in 2013 and returned a year later with fake French identity papers, the statement said. He had been sought on charges of falsifying documents, and remained in custody on Friday, as did the Algerian couple.\n\nThe police said they had so far not found any evidence of a concrete target in Berlin for a terrorist attack. No arms or explosives were found in Thursday\u2019s raids, but the police said they had seized a large number of computers, documents and cellphones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother 30-year-old man was investigated in Berlin and a 25-year-old man at a refugee shelter in Hanover, the police said, but they were not detained. Both were also Algerian citizens.\n\nThe 30-year-old came to Germany in 2004 and currently had a valid residence permit, the police statement said. It said without further detail that the 25-year-old had had \u201cproven contact\u201d with Belgium, where several of the Paris terrorist assailants also had ties. German media, citing unidentified security sources, said the younger man had recently visited Molenbeek, the suburb of Brussels where several Paris assailants lived or visited.\n\nThe police statement said that all five people connected with Thursday\u2019s raids had been offered to be formally questioned, \u201cand this offer was partly accepted,\u201d suggesting that one or more of those held might give more information about the alleged plan for an attack.\n\nAsked how much Germany should fear a terrorist attack, Mr. Maassen suggested that was the wrong question.\n\n\u201cThe expression \u2018fear\u2019 is the wrong one here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in a situation which is serious, and we have a high risk that there can be a terrorist attack.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, security services and the police are on high alert. \u201cOur goal is to minimize the risk,\u201d he said.", "summary": "On Friday, the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, Hans-Georg Maassen, said the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, was using the wave of newcomers to infiltrate Europe.
