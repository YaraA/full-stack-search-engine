{"title": "As Terrorists Cross Borders, Europe Sees Anew That Its Intelligence Does Not", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/world/europe/as-terrorists-cross-borders-europe-sees-anew-that-its-intelligence-does-not.html", "body": "\u201cIs it not in the nature of intelligence agencies to keep the information for themselves?\u201d asked Jean-Marie Delarue, who until recently headed the French agency that reviews surveillance requests from these intelligence services.\n\n\u201cInformation is power,\u201d Mr. Delarue said in a recent interview. \u201cIn intelligence, one only has enemies, no friends.\u201d\n\nCross-border cooperation could possibly have helped prevent Tuesday\u2019s attacks. Mr. Erdogan said Wednesday that both the Netherlands and the Belgian authorities had been informed of Mr. Bakraoui\u2019s deportation, since he was a Belgian citizen.\n\nTerrorist Attacks in Belgium Despite its relatively small size, Belgium has become the scene of several terror attacks and plots.\n\nWhat intelligence services in either country did with that information \u2014 and whether they shared it with one another other or neighboring countries \u2014 was not immediately clear.\n\nYet it is certain that the absence of inter-European help was deeply harmful not only in Brussels but also in staving off the massacres in Paris in November.\n\nThe Paris plotters slipped easily in and out of Europe, then hatched their plans in one country, Belgium, before carrying them out in another, France. Then one slipped across the border again, taking advantage of the openness that is foundational to the European Union.\n\n\u201cWe were victims of solidarity with the European Union,\u201d Mr. Delarue said of the Paris attacks.\n\n\u201cWe think there should be cooperation,\u201d he added. \u201cWe rely on what the other countries give us. We are dependent on what they give us. And I don\u2019t think the Belgians gave us precise information.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA former top official with France\u2019s external intelligence agency, Alain Juillet, said that the \u201cbig lesson\u201d was to \u201crestore the frontiers and establish better cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a permanent liaison with the Belgians,\u201d he added.\n\nBut if neighbors with a common language, a long common border and common enemies cannot work together, who can?\n\nEurope has had a \u201ccounterterrorism coordinator\u201d for much of the last 10 years, but this fact-finding institution was dismissed as \u201cweak\u201d in a recent French parliamentary report, and as \u201chaving no operational capacity to offer.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of an effective centralized European counterterrorism agency, it is up to the member states to cooperate with one another. Yet they do so only haphazardly.\n\nThere are plenty of databases, for instance, but the information they contain is either incomplete or inaccessible, numerous officials complained.\n\nA fundamental one that contains criminal suspects\u2019 surveillance records \u2014 the Schengen Information System, or SIS \u2014 is only weakly supported by most of the member countries. The French parliamentary report last month said that the French internal intelligence agency \u201cis the only one that regularly feeds this database,\u201d and criticized \u201c the very spotty nature of the information furnished by\u201d other European nations.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing automatic about what goes into the SIS,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a French intelligence expert. He said that a decade of European squabbling over the issue had still not resulted in the creation of a minimal tool, the Passenger Name Record, of airplane travelers.\n\nIn addition, European Union rules forbid the use of the SIS system for spot-checks on individuals at Schengen\u2019s borders, according to the parliamentary report.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, there is a tension between the need to cooperate, which is recognized,\u201d said Thomas Renard, a terrorism expert at Belgium\u2019s Egmont Institute. \u201cOn the other hand, there is the lack of confidence that the different services have in each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone knows we need to work together,\u201d he added. \u201cBut for each specific case, they will say, \u2018We can\u2019t give up the information, because we are still working on the investigation.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is not just the main SIS database that is woefully lacking.\n\nSome 5,000 European Union citizens are known to have traveled to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State and other groups. Yet the Europol database \u201ccontains only 2,786 verified foreign terrorist fighters entered by E.U. member states,\u201d the counterterrorism coordinator pointed out in a recent report.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest problem lies in the different levels of professionalism among the security services in Europe,\u201d Guido Steinberg, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told German public broadcaster ARD on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have an enormous number of well-equipped states such as France and Great Britain, to those who are weaker such as Germany, to those who are completely overwhelmed such as Belgium,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said.\n\nAnother European database contains 90,000 fingerprints \u201cbut there is no search possibility yet,\u201d the counterterrorism coordinator pointed out.\n\n\u201cWe must have a permanent exchange on the European level,\u201d Elmar Brok, a European Parliament member close to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, told ARD Wednesday.\n\nThe February French parliamentary report ruefully acknowledged, without citing a specific assault, systematic \u201cgaps in the transmission of information, which, if they had been realized in time, could have forestalled the attack\u201d in Paris.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.
