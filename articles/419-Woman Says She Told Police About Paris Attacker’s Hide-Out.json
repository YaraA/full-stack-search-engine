She said he responded, \u201cThe cafes in the 10th Arrondissement, that was me and it is not finished.\u201d\n\nShe later learned he was planning to target three more places, including a child care center, all of them in La D\u00e9fense, a large business district west of Paris.\n\nSurprised by his confident admission that he was responsible for some of the killings, she said she told him, \u201cBut you killed innocent people.\u201d\n\nShe said he responded: \u201cThey were not innocent. You have to look at what is happening to us in Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you say you are Muslim, but you have killed Muslims,\u201d she told him.\n\nHe responded that they were \u201ccollateral damage.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

He boasted: \u201cFrance is nothing. \u2026 One can re-enter without official documents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere are Syrians, Iraqis, French, German, English, 90 of us returned, we are everywhere in the \u00cele-de-France,\u201d he told her, referring to the region surrounding Paris.\n\nIt is not clear if the 90 people he describes are all working with the Islamic State. If so, that would mean there are a large number of potential attackers in the Paris metropolitan area.\n\nThe woman also said that Mr. Abaaoud had told her that there were a number of failings in the Nov. 13 attacks, including an explosive belt that failed to detonate, and that he was there to make sure that \u201cthere will be no more failures.\u201d\n\nIt was after this conversation that the woman went to the police and told them that Mr. Abaaoud was under the bridge. Later, she told them where the apartment was that Ms. Boulahcen had rented for him. The police detective who was her contact explained that they would raid the apartment.\n\n\u201cI asked them not to kill Hasna, and he promised me that they will not kill her, that they weren\u2019t interested in her,\u201d she said.\n\nBut more than a thousand bullets were fired in the raid, and Ms. Boulahcen, who was wearing a suicide vest, died.\n\n\u201cI know they told me she was a suicide bomber, but I know Hasna did not want to die,\u201d the woman said.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor\u2019s office and the police did not dispute any aspect of the woman\u2019s interview. But the prosecutor\u2019s office, in a terse statement, said it was opening an inquiry into whether a French law that protects the \u201csecrecy of the investigation\u201d had been breached.\n\nThe prosecutor, Fran\u00e7ois Molins, signaled that he would be looking into both the legality of the publication of the interview by the news media as well as how the information about the woman\u2019s account had been leaked.", "summary": "She later learned he was planning to target three more places, including a child care center, all of them in La D\u00e9fense, a large business district west of Paris. \u201cThere are Syrians, Iraqis, French, German, English, 90 of us returned, we are everywhere in the \u00cele-de-France,\u201d he told her, referring to the region surrounding Paris.
