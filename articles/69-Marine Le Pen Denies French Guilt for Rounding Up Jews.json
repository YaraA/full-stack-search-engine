It was the French government\u2019s police chief, Ren\u00e9 Bousquet \u2014 a favorite of the head of the government at the time \u2014 who organized the roundup, impressing his German counterparts with his energy.\n\n\u201cVichy did not have a knife to its throat,\u201d the historian Philippe Burrin wrote of the Vel d\u2019Hiv roundup in his landmark book, \u201cLa France \u00e0 l\u2019Heure Allemande,\u201d (\u201cFrance Under the Germans\u201d).\n\n\u201cWithout the help of the police\u201d \u2014 the French police \u2014 \u201cthe SS was paralyzed,\u201d Mr. Burrin wrote. \u201cThe French authorities were entirely disposed to get rid of foreign Jews,\u201d he wrote, referring to the officials\u2019 offer to the Nazis, on that occasion at least, to hand over Jews who were not French citizens.\n\nMs. Le Pen\u2019s remark on Sunday was criticized as a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d by her principal election opponent, the former economy minister Emmanuel Macron, and as \u201cnegationism\u201d by a leader on the right, Christian Estrosi, the president of the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur region. The Israeli government also had harsh words, as did French Jewish organizations.\n\nMs. Le Pen\u2019s campaign has been oriented around an extreme form of nationalism, and she often criticizes historians and others who bring up the uglier aspects of France\u2019s past, as she did on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve taught our children that they have all the reasons in the world to criticize it, to only see its darkest historical aspects,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to be proud of being French.\u201d\n\nMainstream candidates on the right have uttered similar sentiments about respecting France\u2019s \u201cnational narrative.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As the American historian Robert Paxton has pointed out, France was unique in Western Europe in that it was the only country to use its own police force for roundups in territory not occupied by the Germans.\n\nEver since President Jacques Chirac declared in a speech in 1995 commemorating the Vel d\u2019Hiv roundup that \u201cFrance, on that day, committed the irreparable,\u201d the question of French complicity and guilt has appeared largely settled, officially at least. \u201cGoing back on its word, it delivered those whom it was protecting to their executioners,\u201d Mr. Chirac said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Sunday night, to quiet the growing polemic, Ms. Le Pen tried to place her words in the context of others who have disassociated the Vichy government from France itself. \u201cI consider that France and its Republic were in London during the occupation, and that the Vichy regime wasn\u2019t France,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said in a news release.\n\nThere again, the historians\u2019 verdict is different. The Vichy government initially enjoyed wide support, its functionaries and officials came largely from the prewar bureaucracy, and many went on to have excellent careers in government and business after the war. Foreign countries, including the United States, maintained embassies at Vichy and had cordial relations with it.\n\nMr. Bousquet received a suspended sentence in 1949 and had a successful career in business afterward. His role and high connections were only belatedly re-exposed 40 years later, when he was charged with crimes against humanity. He was shot dead by a deranged person in June 1993.\n\n\u201cTo isolate Vichy from the French population, that doesn\u2019t hold up for one second,\u201d one of France\u2019s leading historians of the period, Henry Rousso, said on Monday. \u201cYou only have to look at the newsreels of the crowds applauding P\u00e9tain,\u201d Mr. Rousso said, referring to the wartime Vichy leader, Marshal P\u00e9tain. \u201cNot all of France was at Vichy. But a part of it was.\u201d\n\nMs. Le Pen\u2019s remark was all the more puzzling in that she has worked strenuously to dissociate herself from her party\u2019s anti-Semitic past, embodied by her father, the party founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who notoriously called the Holocaust a \u201cdetail in the history of the Second World War.\u201d\n\nEx-wartime Nazi collaborators were prominent in the early leadership of the National Front in the 1970s \u2014 including members of the French SS and collaborationist Milice, and even a leading official of the French wartime anti-Jewish agency, a minor cog in the Holocaust.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Holocaust denial \u201chad become a wholesale part of the Front\u2019s ideology,\u201d the historian Val\u00e9rie Igounet has written. Ms. Le Pen has typically distanced herself from that aspect of her party.", "summary": "Le Pen\u2019s words also flew in the face of over four decades of historical research into the eager collaboration of the wartime French government, which had been installed in the spa town of Vichy.Le Pen\u2019s remark on Sunday was criticized as a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d by her principal election opponent, the former economy minister Emmanuel Macron, and as \u201cnegationism\u201d by a leader on the right, Christian Estrosi, the president of the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur region.Le Pen\u2019s campaign has been oriented around an extreme form of nationalism, and she often criticizes historians and others who bring up the uglier aspects of France\u2019s past, as she did on Sunday.As the American historian Robert Paxton has pointed out, France was unique in Western Europe in that it was the only country to use its own police force for roundups in territory not occupied by the Germans.Ever since President Jacques Chirac declared in a speech in 1995 commemorating the Vel d\u2019Hiv roundup that \u201cFrance, on that day, committed the irreparable,\u201d the question of French complicity and guilt has appeared largely settled, officially at least."}
