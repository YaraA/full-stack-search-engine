{"title": "Range of Frustrations Reached Boil as Turkey Shot Down Russian Jet", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/26/world/europe/turkey-russia-fighter-jet.html", "body": "\u201cThat would require Turkey-backed rebels to be present in Syria, and I think Turkey was alarmed that Russia\u2019s bombing of positions held by Turkey-backed rebels in northern Syria was hurting their positions and therefore Turkey\u2019s future stakes in Syria,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said. \u201cSo this is also an aggressive Turkey posture in the Syrian civil war to prevent the defeat of Turkey-backed rebels so they can hold onto territory and have a say in the future of Syria.\u201d\n\nBut the fate of the particular rebels the Russians were bombing in the mountainous Bayirbucak area where the plane was shot down is more than just a policy matter to the Turks. Mr. Erdogan particularly emphasized the ethnic tie in a speech Tuesday evening, saying, \u201cWe strongly condemn attacks focusing on areas inhabited by Bayirbucak Turkmen \u2014 we have our relatives, our kin there.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said as much on Wednesday while dismissing Russia\u2019s explanation that it was fighting a common enemy, the Islamic State. \u201cNo one,\u201d he said, \u201ccan legitimize attacks on Turkmens in Syria using the pretext of fighting the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nThe bombing was creating political problems for Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Cagaptay said. \u201cIn the days leading up to the incident, many newspapers, especially the pro-government publications, were running headlines highlighting the suffering of the Turkmens, who are closely related to Anatolian Turks,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the government felt that, in terms of domestic politics, it had to do something to ease some of this pressure that had resulted from the Russian bombardment against Turkmens in northern Syria.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s bombing of Turkmen villages was to be the principal issue Turkey raised with Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in talks that had been set for Wednesday but were canceled after the shooting down of the plane.\n\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s emphasis on helping the Turkmens has another important political dimension in Turkey. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s political party emphasized Turkish ethnic identity and Sunni Muslim faith in the campaign leading up to critical elections on Nov. 1, as it competed with one rival party heavily composed of Turkey\u2019s Kurdish minority and another committed to preserving Turkey\u2019s status as a secular society and state.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Erdogan managed an important victory in that election, preserving his chances of winning legislative approval to change the Constitution and turn the country\u2019s parliamentary system into a presidential one.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nComplicating matters further, Turkey and Syria have a longstanding border dispute in exactly the area where the Russian plane, a Sukhoi Su-24, was shot down, and Russia has sometimes voiced support for Syria\u2019s claim. It is a narrow strip of territory, the Hatay Province of Turkey, that runs south along the Mediterranean Sea, deep into Syria.\n\nThe province is a melting pot of ethnic Turks and Arabs. It is also a religious m\u00e9lange, with many Muslims but also a large Christian population, as Hatay includes the biblical city of Antioch. And the province has an acrimonious history.\n\nThe League of Nations granted Hatay Province to France after World War I as part of France\u2019s legal mandate over Syria. Ethnic Turks led the province\u2019s secession from Syria and declaration of an independent republic in 1938, and that republic then joined Turkey the next year \u2014 much as Texas seceded from Mexico a century earlier, became a republic and soon joined the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\nSyria has periodically questioned the loss of Hatay over the years. \u201cIf you look at Syrian maps, that province, that chunk of territory, is shown as belonging to Syria,\u201d said Altay Atli, an international relations specialist at Bogazici University.\n\nWhen Hatay seceded from the French mandate of Syria, Hatay\u2019s borders did not encompass all of the ethnic Turks in the area; many Turkmens remained just across the border in what is now northernmost Syria. For decades, it was difficult for families divided on either side of the border by the secession of Hatay to even visit one another. Tensions finally began to ease during the years immediately before the Arab Spring, but they have resumed in the last several years as Turkey has led calls for the removal of Mr. Assad.\n\nThe fact that Russia has over the years expressed sympathy for Syria\u2019s claim to Hatay makes the province even more delicate for Turkey, and Tuesday\u2019s incident with the Russian jet even more important, said James F. Jeffrey, a former American ambassador to Turkey who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nHe questioned whether the Russian jet had strayed into Hatay Province\u2019s airspace accidentally or whether Russia might have been deliberately allowing incursions by its jets during military activities in Syria because of Hatay\u2019s tangled history.\n\n\u201cTurkey was tired of Russia\u2019s intimidating Turkey,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Russian and Ottoman Empires battled for centuries for control over the area from the Balkans to the Black Sea, and vestiges of that bloody rivalry keep arising. One of those is reflected in Turkey\u2019s deep concern about Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, said Murat Yesiltas, the director of security studies at the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research, a large research group in Ankara with close government links.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTurkey now faces across the Black Sea a much wider arc of territory occupied by Russian forces. Many in Turkey are further upset by Russia\u2019s treatment of the Crimean Tatars, who speak a Turkic language and have opposed the Russian annexation. Most of the Crimean Tatars\u2019 leaders have been forced into exile by Russia, and this week Tatars have been blocking repair crews from restringing crucial power lines to Crimea that were mysteriously blown up over the weekend, producing a nearly total blackout on the peninsula.\n\n\u201cTurkey wants to protect the territorial integrity of Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Yesiltas said. Turkey has already provided economic assistance to Ukraine, but it has been reluctant to confront Moscow more publicly because Russia is one of Turkey\u2019s biggest export markets and supplies three-fifths of Turkey\u2019s natural gas.\n\nWith President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia saying things about the jet\u2019s downing like, \u201cWe will never tolerate such crimes like the one committed today\u201d and warning of \u201cserious consequences,\u201d the biggest question perhaps is what comes next.\n\nPhoto\n\nRussia on Wednesday announced plans to deploy its most modern air-defense system, the S-400 mobile antiaircraft missile, to its air base outside Latakia. But while most experts \u2014 and Mr. Erdogan himself, in remarks on Wednesday \u2014 play down concerns of a wider confrontation, many worry that the biggest losers from Tuesday\u2019s incident could be the Turkmens.\n\nWhile the jet\u2019s two crew members were able to eject from the plane, Russia said that one of them was killed \u2014 possibly by fire from the ground as he floated to earth \u2014 as was a marine sent in a helicopter that was shot down by local ground forces while trying to rescue the pilots; the Kremlin said the second crew member had been rescued by Russian special forces.\n\nSeveral experts warned that Mr. Putin may step up his country\u2019s attacks on the Turkmens in retaliation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the real target,\u201d Mr. Jeffrey said. \u201cHe can just plaster them.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Erdogan particularly emphasized the ethnic tie in a speech Tuesday evening, saying, \u201cWe strongly condemn attacks focusing on areas inhabited by Bayirbucak Turkmen \u2014 we have our relatives, our kin there.\u201d Mr. Erdogan managed an important victory in that election, preserving his chances of winning legislative approval to change the Constitution and turn the country\u2019s parliamentary system into a presidential one.
