Mr. Johnson, a Conservative, suggested on Friday that Mr. Obama removed a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office because it \u201cwas a symbol of the part-Kenyan president\u2019s ancestral dislike of the British Empire, of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama said he saw another bust of Churchill every day in the White House residence.\n\n\u201cI love the guy,\u201d he said. But as the first African-American president, he said, he \u201cthought it appropriate\u201d to have a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the Oval Office.\n\nMr. Cameron, for his part, smiled thinly and said that \u201cquestions for Boris are questions for Boris and not questions for me.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister praised Mr. Obama for his friendship and \u201csage advice,\u201d and said that Britain was made stronger through its continued membership in the European Union and that \u201cthe stronger we are, the stronger that special relationship\u201d with the United States will be. Mr. Cameron noted that \u201cit was hard to find any country that wishes Britain well that wants us to leave the E.U.,\u201d and that Britons should listen to their friends and then vote as they choose.\n\nStrong historical, emotional, cultural and security ties with Britain would continue no matter the vote, Mr. Obama said. But the United States, he said, was convinced that Britain made a shaky Europe stronger and more stable by its membership and that the bloc \u201cenhances\u201d Britain\u2019s \u201cinfluence and power and economy.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nHe argued that the United States accepted constraints on its sovereignty, too, in multilateral institutions like NATO, the United Nations Security Council, the Group of 7 and Group of 20, and did so for the common good, which also was in America\u2019s interests.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarlier on Friday, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, traveled by helicopter to Windsor Castle for lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, who turned 90 on Thursday, and her husband, Prince Philip, 94.\n\nThe Obamas also had a private dinner Friday night with Prince William and his wife, Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry at Kensington Palace in London.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, said that Mr. Obama should \u201cbutt out.\u201d\n\nOne of the most polarizing responses came from Mr. Johnson, who was born in Manhattan and retains his American passport as a dual citizen. Mr. Johnson, who is also a member of Parliament and has ambitions to replace Mr. Cameron as prime minister, has argued that the United States is a traditional nation-state that would never transfer some of its sovereignty to any European Union-like organization.\n\n\u201cFor the United States to tell us in the U.K. that we must surrender control of so much of our democracy \u2014 it is a breathtaking example of the principle of do-as-I-say-but-not-as-I-do,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote in The Sun, a newspaper that is influential among working-class voters.\n\n\u201cIt is incoherent. It is inconsistent, and yes it is downright hypocritical,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.\n\nOn Twitter, Nicholas Soames, a Conservative member of Parliament and a grandson of Churchill, condemned Mr. Johnson\u2019s essay, calling it \u201can appalling article\u201d that is \u201ctotally wrong on almost everything.\u201d It was \u201cinconceivable,\u201d Mr. Soames said, that his grandfather would \u201cnot have welcomed\u201d the president\u2019s views on Britain\u2019s role in Europe.\n\nA former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Menzies Campbell, said that \u201cmany people will find Boris Johnson\u2019s loaded attack on President Obama\u2019s sincerity deeply offensive,\u201d and Diane Abbott, a Labour Party lawmaker, said that \u201cBoris dismissing President Obama as \u2018half-Kenyan\u2019 reflects the worst Tea Party rhetoric.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmerican officials suggested that there was an internal debate about the wisdom of the straightforward opinion editorial Mr. Obama wrote in The Telegraph, but decided that it was better to be upfront about the president\u2019s views as he arrived in Britain and not pretend to be coy.\n\nMr. Cameron clearly favored a strong message from the American president, whose position is shared by the leaders of Britain\u2019s main European allies, France and Germany.\n\nBritain and France are the two strongest military powers in Europe, and Britain is the second-largest economy in the European Union and fifth largest in the world.\n\nThe economic risks of Britain\u2019s exit from the union are important to British voters, but so are immigration and the inability of Britain to limit the number of European Union citizens who want to live and work here. While studies show that the immigrants contribute considerably more to the British budget in taxes than they receive in benefits, there are worries that the immigrants are taking jobs away from Britons.\n\nThese arguments are likely to be more important than those about Britain\u2019s standing in the world or the country\u2019s relationship with the United States.", "summary": "Earlier on Friday, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, traveled by helicopter to Windsor Castle for lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, who turned 90 on Thursday, and her husband, Prince Philip, 94.
