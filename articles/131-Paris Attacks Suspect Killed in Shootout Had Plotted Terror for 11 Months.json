Two suspected militants \u2014 both from Molenbeek, where Mr. Abaaoud grew up \u2014 were killed.\n\nInformation about his whereabouts and plans was so closely held that intelligence officials in Brussels kept even the mayor of Verviers and its police chief unaware that the Islamic State had set up a safe house in their town and was planning a major attack.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI only heard about Abaaoud and what he was doing by reading the press,\u201d said Marc Elsen, the town\u2019s mayor at the time of the Jan. 15 assault on the hideaway controlled by Mr. Abaaoud.\n\nHe said he had gotten a call just 15 minutes before the raid to tell him that a \u201clarge-scale operation\u201d by the federal police was about to take place a few hundred yards from his office. \u201cThen I heard all the shooting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounded like heavy artillery.\u201d\n\nBy Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s own account of what happened, published in the Islamic State magazine Dabiq, the two men killed in the raid had been \u201ctogether in the safe house and had their weapons and explosive ready.\u201d\n\nKnown Suspects in Paris Attacks\n\nBut they were overpowered by \u201cmore than 150 soldiers from both French and Belgian special forces\u201d and \u201cblessed with shahadah,\u201d or martyrdom, he told the magazine, saying that was \u201cwhat they had desired for so long.\u201d\n\nBelgium officials said that this was a lie and that only Belgian forces had taken part.\n\nFor Mr. Abaaoud, the police operation delivered a humiliating personal blow. The Islamic State had entrusted him with beginning what one of the group\u2019s senior leaders, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, had promised a few months earlier would be a campaign of terror in Europe.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A rival terrorist group in Yemen, affiliated with Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for that. The Islamic State claimed a separate attack two days later on a Jewish supermarket in Paris, but that was more a \u201clone wolf\u201d assault, inspired rather than directed by the group.\n\nJihadist groups are \u201calways competing,\u201d said Jelle van Buuren, an expert on jihadists at Leiden University, in the Netherlands. \u201cWho\u2019s the best, who\u2019s the most violent, who\u2019s the most successful?\u201d\n\nMr. Abaaoud\u2019s failure so soon after the successful Charlie Hebdo attacks may have galvanized him to organize and conduct an even more spectacular assault like the one in Paris last week, Mr. van Buuren added.\n\nHe described Mr. Abaaoud as \u201ca type who is so proud of his image, the big warrior of the caliphate, that he was more than willing to take this role.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nTo add to the pressure to perform, Mr. Adnani, the Islamic State\u2019s chief propagandist and champion of its expansion into the West, issued an appeal shortly after the Verviers fiasco that cursed any Muslim \u201cwho has the ability to shed a single drop of crusader blood but does not do so, whether with an explosive device, a bullet, a knife, a car, a rock, or even a boot or a fist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was the duty of all Muslims, he said, \u201cin Europe and the disbelieving West and everywhere else, to target the crusaders in their own lands and wherever they are found.\u201d\n\nMr. Adnani, following the Islamic State\u2019s custom of casting defeats as victories, still added the failed operation in Belgium to a list of successes that included a shooting at the Canadian Parliament and the January attacks in Paris. But he put Belgium last.\n\nIf the Verviers debacle helped fire Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s zeal, it also prompted him to improve his terrorist tradecraft. He stopped using the telephone, or at least one that could be listened in on.\n\nSecurity officials believe that the Paris attackers used some kind of encrypted communication, though they let their guard down by tossing a cellphone into a trash can near the Bataclan theater, the site of the most deaths in Friday\u2019s attacks. The geolocation services on the phone led investigators to one of the attackers\u2019 hide-outs.\n\nWith the carnage on Friday, Mr. Abaaoud put the Verviers disaster behind him. A dropout, he became, in the words of the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, \u201cone of the brains\u201d behind the deadliest assault on Paris since World War II.\n\nWhere Mr. Abaaoud was at the time of the Verviers raid is unclear. He suggested in his interview with Dabiq that he had been somewhere in Belgium and had managed to evade detection and travel back to Syria.\n\nBut the Belgian security official, noting that much of what the Islamic State says is untrue, said Mr. Abaaoud had not been in Belgium: He had called from Greece with instructions shortly before the house was stormed. That call, the official said, was the last trace security agencies had of him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhether Mr. Abaaoud was in Belgium at all in this period is not known, the official said. It is easy, he added, to move around Europe without leaving a trace, especially for a citizen of Belgium, part of the 26-nation zone in Europe that allows visa-free travel.\n\nWho knew what, and when, about Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s travels is now a source of friction among European countries, which have opened their borders to one another but not their intelligence.\n\nFar-right politicians, in particular, have seized on his travels to rally public support to end what was the proudest achievement of Europe\u2019s postwar push for more integration: the so-called Schengen Area of visa-free travel.\n\n\u201cIt seems that just about anybody can freely enter France now, with no checks, including somebody as dangerous and well known as Abdelhamid Abaaoud,\u201d Marine Le Pen of France\u2019s National Front said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe absence of national borders is criminal madness,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. \u201cThe French elites have given themselves over to this surreal myth of a country without borders.
