Some even make it a family outing.\n\n\u201cWe already pretty much do everything together, so of course we also travel here together,\u201d said Fernando Rodr\u00edguez Flores, 28, who has been a costalero for 11 years and stood beside his father, also called Fernando, who has 28 years of service as a costalero. They came for the evening from \u00c9cija, a town about 60 miles away, where they both work as bricklayers.\n\nA float can weigh as much as 5,400 pounds, like that carried by Luismi Fajardo, a local police officer who is one of the costaleros in the brotherhood of La Macarena and has a large bulge on his neck as a result of carrying the float for the past 28 years.\n\nBesides its heavy structure of metal and wooden beams, the float is weighed down by decorations that include several statues, sometimes depicting a whole scene from the Bible. On Mr. Fajardo\u2019s float, Pontius Pilate washes his hands while Jesus is condemned to death.\n\nDuring the practice runs, the statues and other lavish ornaments are often replaced by concrete blocks to match their full weight.\n\nFRANCE Bay of Biscay 200 miles ANDORRA SPAIN Barcelona PORTUGAL Madrid Seville Atlantic Ocean ALGERIA MOROCCO\n\nBut however intense the training, the actual Holy Week procession is a lot more difficult, not only because of the extra responsibility of carrying precious statues along crowded streets, but also because the float is then draped in a heavy velvet cloth. Walking below it, the costaleros must breathe through small holes along the wooden edges of the platform. Some faint along the way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt gets incredibly hot down there,\u201d Mr. Fajardo said. \u201cThis is really more about resistance than pure strength, like what you need to run a long-distance race.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the floats are carried on different routes linking the city\u2019s churches to its cathedral, sometimes for as long as 14 hours. Along the route, two teams of costaleros generally work in relay. (The professional dockworkers used to cover the whole route with one team.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This year, he had 40 applications to fill six vacancies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique chance to achieve something special together and also build real friendships,\u201d he said. \u201cYou start as costaleros and end up going to each other\u2019s birthdays and weddings.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the Holy Week celebrations also acted as a social leveler, putting on a par the different professional guilds linked to the religious brotherhoods and even African slaves, who were allowed to form their own Seville brotherhood, called \u201cLos Negritos.\u201d\n\nThe processions, therefore, \u201ctranscend religion,\u201d Mr. Ru\u00edz Gonz\u00e1lez, the historian, argued. \u201cThey gave even excluded people like the slaves a chance to regain some sense of identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNowadays, that drive toward social inclusion has also involved adding teams of women as costaleros in some Spanish cities.\n\nIn Seville, however, the task of lifting the Holy Week floats remains an affair for men only, even if women have been allowed to join the processions as hooded penitents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of discrimination,\u201d F\u00e9lix Mezquita Gayangos, the head of the Carreter\u00eda brotherhood, said, \u201cbut a recognition that there are different roles in life, and that men and women aren\u2019t the same and have different physical strengths.\u201d", "summary": "Despite the lack of pay, the reputation of Seville\u2019s Holy Week is such that men travel from across the southern region of Andalusia to join its religious brotherhoods as costaleros.But however intense the training, the actual Holy Week procession is a lot more difficult, not only because of the extra responsibility of carrying precious statues along crowded streets, but also because the float is then draped in a heavy velvet cloth.Minutes later, however, Juan Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez S\u00e1nchez, the man charged with leading the float of the Carreter\u00eda brotherhood around Seville\u2019s narrow streets, gave a pep talk to his costaleros during which he also urged them to \u201cremain as discreet as possible.\u201dIn Seville, however, the task of lifting the Holy Week floats remains an affair for men only, even if women have been allowed to join the processions as hooded penitents.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of discrimination,\u201d F\u00e9lix Mezquita Gayangos, the head of the Carreter\u00eda brotherhood, said, \u201cbut a recognition that there are different roles in life, and that men and women aren\u2019t the same and have different physical strengths.\u201d"}
