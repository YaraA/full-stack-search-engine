Tires were burned. Hundreds of England-bound trucks ground to a halt.\n\nMost alarming for many Britons, some of the thousands of migrants camping out around Calais scrambled for hiding places in the log-jammed vehicles to cross the channel \u2014 the last hurdle of an odyssey that, according to United Nations figures, brought a record 150,000 migrants to Europe last year.\n\nVideo\n\nArguably the south-north flow is one more sign of the failure to build a new order after the Cold War to contain divisions of belief, ethnicity and geopolitics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJust last week, indeed, the United Nations produced the startling assessment that the number of people pushed out of their homes by combat, repression and unrest had reached a record 59.5 million \u2014 nearly 14 million of them in the past year alone.\n\nThat enormous wall of human misery stands behind those fleeing toward Europe, hundreds of them dying in the process.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That approach, however, ignores what David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, called a broader effort to settle conflicts that force people from their own lands.\n\n\u201cBy the time ships are pulling bodies from the Mediterranean,\u201d he said in a speech last week, \u201cit is too late.\u201d\n\nIn the 19th century, Europe\u2019s industrialization fueled the imperial drive for riches. In the 21st, the imperative has turned back on itself, offering portends of what Mr. Miliband called a \u201cdecade of disorder\u201d \u2014 if not much longer.", "summary": "\u201cIf selfishness and fear prevail,\u201d the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, wrote in The Guardian, \u201cwe risk losing the noble idea underpinning the European project.\u201d At a time of wider divisions over Greek debt and Britain\u2019s discernible shift toward leaving the European Union, the question is this: What purpose will Europe serve if its successes are measured exclusively by the narrow self-interest individual states?
