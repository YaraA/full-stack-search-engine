During that time, Mrs. May aims to agree to divorce terms and to negotiate a new economic relationship with the countries that remain in the European Union.\n\nIn a speech that she is expected to deliver on Wednesday, she will argue that as Britons \u201cface the opportunities ahead of us on this momentous journey, our shared values, interests and ambitions can \u2014 and must \u2014 bring us together,\u201d according to excerpts issued by her office.\n\nMrs. May will also promise that, in negotiations, she will \u201crepresent every person in the whole United Kingdom,\u201d including citizens of countries in the European Union who have made Britain their home.\n\nAs she embarks on the talks to leave the bloc, Mrs. May knows that one of her many challenges is to secure a deal that helps avert a breakup of Britain.\n\nBut because of her control over the timing, a referendum on Scottish independence is unlikely to happen anytime soon.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe vote on Tuesday empowers Scotland\u2019s pro-independence first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to formally request a referendum, but she already knows Mrs. May\u2019s answer: not now.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe British government plans to withhold agreement at least until it has secured its departure from the bloc, scheduled for the first half of 2019.\n\nOn Tuesday, David Mundell, the British government\u2019s Scottish secretary, seemed to push the timetable further by saying that government \u201cwon\u2019t be entering into any negotiations at all until the Brexit process is complete.\u201d That hints at a date beyond the British withdrawal and after any further transitional period, perhaps several years later.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They may now lose it anyway. Ms. Sturgeon argued that Scots should have the right to choose between Brexit \u201cor becoming an independent country, able to chart our own course and create a true partnership of equals across these islands.\u201d\n\nMs. Sturgeon argues that the shape of any Brexit deal should be known by autumn 2018. Scots should then have the opportunity to try, through independence, to stay in the European Union, or at least in its single market and customs union, she has said.\n\nBut with London intent on blocking a referendum anytime soon, Ms. Sturgeon\u2019s best hope may be for Mrs. May\u2019s stalling tactics to backfire \u2014 annoying Scots enough to persuade a majority to support independence if they finally have the chance to vote."}
