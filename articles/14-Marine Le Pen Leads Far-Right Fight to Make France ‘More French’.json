{"title": "Marine Le Pen Leads Far-Right Fight to Make France \u2018More French\u2019", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/world/europe/france-election-marine-le-pen.html", "body": "\u201cBut it\u2019s up to the owner to decide who can come in,\u201d Ms. Le Pen continued. \u201cSo, our first act will be to restore France\u2019s frontiers.\u201d\n\nThe words were red meat to her base of supporters and were intended to shore up her flagging poll numbers as the campaign closes. Polls once showed her at 30 percent, but instead of consolidating her lead, her support fell as doubts about her readiness to govern grew.\n\nFrance\u2019s Vote: The Basics The presidential election will be held in two stages.\n\nTwo men who were thought to be also-rans \u2014 Jean Luc M\u00e9lenchon of the far left and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon of the center right \u2014 have been catching up and are within three points of her. Ms. Le Pen is still expected to emerge on Sunday as one of the two finalists in the May 7 runoff, a breakthrough for the far right, given that her father\u2019s second-place finish 15 years ago came as a shock.\n\nPolls predict a heavy loss for her in the second round, however. A poll conducted for Le Monde and published on Tuesday said she would get only about 30 percent of Mr. Fillon\u2019s voters in the second round \u2014 not nearly enough, according to Jo\u00ebl Gombin, a National Front specialist at the University of Picardy Jules Verne, who said she must get more than 50 percent of former Fillon supporters to have a shot at winning the presidency.\n\nBut Ms. Le Pen is not taking any chances with the first round, either. Tough talk on immigrants is what her supporters want from her, and on Wednesday night at the D\u00f4me, a metal-covered arena in a run-down neighborhood of Marseille, set back from the port, they were not disappointed.\n\nAs she denounced her opponents on the left as \u201cimmigrationists,\u201d men in the stands shouted, coarsely, that they would cut off a certain part of their rivals\u2019 anatomy.\n\nPolice officers brandishing automatic weapons guarded the hall \u2014 two men were arrested in Marseille on Tuesday and are suspected of preparing an attack to disrupt the election \u2014 and Ms. Le Pen eagerly linked immigration to \u201cinsecurity,\u201d a favorite theme of hers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nViolent protests by leftist demonstrators have disrupted recent National Front meetings, although those held on Wednesday were relatively subdued.\n\nReferring to those under surveillance as possible security threats \u2014 a day before a man with an assault rifle fatally shot a police officer in Paris \u2014 Ms. Le Pen called France a \u201chotbed of S-files, that immense army of the shadows who want us to live in terror.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe unleashed volleys of fearful warnings about her country\u2019s transformation \u2014 in her telling \u2014 by an immigrant wave.\n\n\u201cThe third-world demographic push is accelerating,\u201d she warned. \u201cThere is a migratory submersion which is sweeping everything before it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill we be able to live much longer as French people in France, while entire neighborhoods are being transformed?\u201d Ms. Le Pen asked. \u201cIt is right for us not to want our country transformed into a mere corridor, a giant railway station.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Le Pen\u2019s words found ready takers in the stands, where supporters spoke with dismay and anger at seeing their hometowns, in their telling, made unrecognizable by the presence of immigrants.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely frightful. I\u2019ve never seen so many burqas,\u201d said Christiane Guille, a nurse from Salon-de-Provence, referring to the head-to-foot robe worn by some Muslim women. \u201cFrightful. And it\u2019s getting worse and worse. It\u2019s like a cult. I know some who have converted. You see them indoctrinated, the passage from one civilization to another.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, there is a huge replacement going on,\u201d Ms. Guille added, using what has become a stock phrase for people on the far right to describe what they see as France\u2019s transformation. \u201cI cry for my Provence. I feel hatred. By what right do they take over my country?\u201d Ms. Le Pen\u2019s words on immigrants, she said, \u201cwent straight to my heart.\u201d\n\nOdile Ferrero, 60, a retired home health worker, said her town, Aubagne, was \u201cstuffed\u201d with immigrants.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like whiteflies. They are just everywhere, everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all the little ones, who used to come home with my daughters, they went swimming together \u2014 and now they are all wearing the veil.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere are some who are good,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut then there are others. And now they have more rights than we do.\u201d\n\nMs. Le Pen has proposed a series of anti-immigration measures, constants in her campaign for months, but with some new ones in the last few days.\n\nShe promised a \u201cmoratorium\u201d on immigration \u201cas soon as I take office\u201d; an end to family reunifications \u2014 the longstanding and divisive policy of allowing into the country family members of immigrants; the expulsion of illegal immigrants, \u201cbecause it is the law\u201d; the expulsion of \u201cS-files\u201d who are foreigners; and cutting medical help to illegal immigrants.\n\nAll of the proposals met with roars of approval.\n\nFrance had a record number of asylum-seekers last year, 85,700, and about 227,500 foreigners were granted residency permits of some sort, an increase of nearly 5 percent from the preceding year. Ms. Le Pen has spoken of drastically limiting legal immigration to around 10,000 people a year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s far too much insecurity, as far as immigrants are concerned,\u201d said Francis Scueil, a cheese factory worker from Salon-de-Provence. \u201cThey are just not adapted to the French way of life. When you go to the markets, that\u2019s all you see.\u201d\n\nAs the buses carrying National Front supporters pulled away from the D\u00f4me, a group of Muslim women, most wearing head scarves, gathered to look, tentatively leaning forward from under an adjoining highway overpass.\n\n\u201cMore and more are coming from the third world, taking advantage of our benefits,\u201d Ms. Le Pen had said at the rally. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice of civilization. I will be the president of those French who want to continue living in France as the French do.\u201d"}
