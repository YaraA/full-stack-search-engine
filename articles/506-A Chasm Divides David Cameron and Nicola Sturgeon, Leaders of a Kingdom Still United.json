What we\u2019re seeing is a historic watershed.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high and hanging over everything is a question that is not formally on the agenda at the moment: Have England and Scotland drifted too far apart to keep their 308-year-old union alive?\n\nThat question seemed to be settled last September, when Scotland voted by a substantial majority to remain part of the United Kingdom. Just eight months later, many voters in Scotland seem to believe that whatever additional powers Mr. Cameron offers the Scottish legislature in the coming weeks, another referendum on independence is only a matter of time.\n\nIn England, polls suggest a hardening of voters\u2019 attitudes toward Scottish demands, in part because of Mr. Cameron\u2019s election campaign, which aggressively depicted the S.N.P. as dangerous and irresponsible. (As one Scottish official put it: \u201cThey insulted the S.N.P. but antagonized all of Scotland.\u201d)\n\nMs. Sturgeon, who took office as first minister after Scotland voted against independence last fall, has made no secret of her ambition for future independence, even as she played down the issue in the aftermath of Thursday\u2019s elections.\n\nAsked about comments by her predecessor, Alex Salmond, who said Scotland was now closer to independence, Ms. Sturgeon told the British Broadcasting Corporation that there was \u201cno disagreement\u201d between them.\n\n\u201cI think Scotland will become an independent country one day,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said he thinks it will be in his lifetime, I hope that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Sturgeon is already looking ahead to Scottish elections next year in which she hopes her party will win a third term and possibly a mandate for another referendum. One scenario for another breakaway bid would be if Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum that Mr. Cameron has promised by the end of 2017.\n\nBut she is in no rush. \u201cThey want to be absolutely sure they can win it before they try again,\u201d said Alex Massie, Scotland editor of The Spectator.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Sturgeon said these elections were not about independence, but rather a mandate on securing new powers that would allow Scotland to pursue more progressive policies at a time when most of Britain backed the continuation of conservative policies.\n\nSome additional powers were already promised to Scotland last September. In the last panicked week before the referendum, as momentum appeared to shift toward a pro-independence vote, the main British parties, including Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservatives, collectively promised the Scots more self-government if they stayed in the union.\n\nThe result was a series of recommendations published last November that included new powers for the Scottish Parliament to set income tax rates, obtain a share of sales tax revenues raised in Scotland and control the duties imposed on passengers traveling through Scottish airports. In addition, Scotland would gain control over some welfare spending.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

It also wants to set its own business tax and raise the minimum wage from Britain\u2019s 6.50 pounds, about $10, to \u00a38.70 by 2020.\n\nWith its free universities and medical prescriptions, Scotland already spends more per person than the rest of Britain. Down the line, Edinburgh wants full fiscal autonomy, but this would involve complex negotiations on how much Scotland would have to contribute to national outlays like military spending and interest on public debt.\n\nIf successful, Mr. Cameron and Ms. Sturgeon could be running two vastly different economic policy experiments north and south of Hadrian\u2019s Wall.\n\nMr. Cameron, 48, who went to Eton and Oxford and whose inner circle has been filled with advisers and ministers of similarly privileged backgrounds, has cut income taxes on the wealthiest, trimmed back public spending and made further deficit reduction a priority. Ms. Sturgeon, 44, who grew up on the edge of a closed coal pit and was the first in her family to go to college, would prefer to slow the pace of deficit cutting and carry out what she calls \u201cmodest\u201d increases in public spending.\n\nOn a personal level, Ms. Sturgeon gets along better with Mr. Cameron than did her formidable but divisive predecessor, Mr. Salmond. After Ms. Sturgeon took over from Mr. Salmond as party leader and first minister \u2014 she had been his deputy in both offices \u2014 Mr. Cameron came to see her in the Scottish Parliament. Their meeting, said one of her advisers, was \u201cinformal and very amicable.\u201d\n\nIf the starting points for their negotiation are far apart, both have also tried to strike a conciliatory tone.\n\n\u201cGoverning with respect means recognizing that the different nations of our United Kingdom have their own governments as well as the United Kingdom government,\u201d Mr. Cameron said.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Sturgeon, whose verve and fluency during the election campaign impressed voters well beyond Scotland, emphasized that the vastly expanded new group of S.N.P. lawmakers would not come to Westminster \u201cto disrupt and destroy.\u201d", "summary": "In the last panicked week before the referendum, as momentum appeared to shift toward a pro-independence vote, the main British parties, including Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservatives, collectively promised the Scots more self-government if they stayed in the union.At the time, Robert Smith, the member of the House of Lords who led the commission on Scotland, said the recommendations would constitute \u201cthe biggest transfer of powers\u201d to the Scottish Parliament since its establishment in 1998.Down the line, Edinburgh wants full fiscal autonomy, but this would involve complex negotiations on how much Scotland would have to contribute to national outlays like military spending and interest on public debt.Mr. Cameron, 48, who went to Eton and Oxford and whose inner circle has been filled with advisers and ministers of similarly privileged backgrounds, has cut income taxes on the wealthiest, trimmed back public spending and made further deficit reduction a priority.Ms. Sturgeon, 44, who grew up on the edge of a closed coal pit and was the first in her family to go to college, would prefer to slow the pace of deficit cutting and carry out what she calls \u201cmodest\u201d increases in public spending."}
