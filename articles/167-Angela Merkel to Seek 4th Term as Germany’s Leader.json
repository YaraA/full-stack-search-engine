{"title": "Angela Merkel to Seek 4th Term as Germany\u2019s Leader", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/world/europe/angela-merkel-germany.html", "body": "Ms. Merkel, 62, has served 11 years as chancellor. She is the first woman and the first person raised in Communist East Germany to hold the post.\n\nSince coming to power in 2005, Ms. Merkel has gradually acquired a political stature commensurate with the power of her country, Western Europe\u2019s largest economy and its most populous nation, with about 81 million inhabitants.\n\nBut her image as the cautious caretaker of her country\u2019s interests has suffered over the past year, after she opened Germany to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, many of them Muslim refugees fleeing wars in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe prospect of integrating almost 1 million newcomers into Germany has weakened Ms. Merkel\u2019s standing at home, despite garnering some praise, particularly from President Obama.\n\nVisiting Berlin last week, Mr. Obama lavished compliments on his longest-standing ally in his eight years in office, saying that if he were German, he would vote for her.\n\nMs. Merkel responded to the election of Mr. Trump with a robust appeal for him to follow Western values and respect human dignity. This, she said, was the basis of any close cooperation.\n\nEven as commentators and leaders outside Germany invoked her stature, Ms. Merkel has been eager not to hog the limelight.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOne person alone can never solve everything,\u201d she said on Friday at a news conference with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain. \u201cWe are strong only together. In that, I want to do what my duty is as chancellor.\u201d\n\nIn the days before her party leadership met on Sunday, several Christian Democrats said that the next parliamentary elections would be difficult to win with Ms. Merkel, but impossible to win without her.\n\nAs she entered the atrium of her party headquarters on Sunday, she was applauded by about two dozen people on a second-floor balcony.\n\nWhile Ms. Merkel mentioned several times that her ability to continue would be contingent on good health, she showed little weariness and gradually became almost feisty as she outlined the challenges to German industry and citizens in the 21st century.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That would scramble conventional coalition building, since no mainstream party has been willing to govern with the populists.\n\nFrauke Petry, one of the leaders of Alternative for Germany, criticized the idea of Ms. Merkel\u2019s gaining another four years in office. \u201cGermany cannot afford another term for Angela Merkel,\u201d Ms. Petry wrote on Twitter.\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s role as a beacon of liberal values may also be dented by the power of populism elsewhere in Europe, whose union has been thrown into ever greater doubt since Britain, the Continent\u2019s leading military power, voted in June to leave the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNext month, Italy votes on constitutional reforms that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi considers crucial to his country\u2019s modernity. Austria will choose a president in an election plagued by delays, and may see the first far-right politician elected as head of state in modern Europe.\n\nThe Netherlands, France and Germany all hold pivotal elections next year, with the ballot in France being closely watched as a bellwether for the strength of populism as embodied by the National Front of Marine Le Pen.\n\nSpeaking in Berlin last week, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France predicted that \u201cEurope can die\u201d as a result of the populist wave and the economic and political dissonance in the 28-nation European Union.\n\nMs. Merkel has guided Germany and, increasingly, Europe though myriad crises.\n\nShe was chancellor during the 2008 financial crisis, and was much criticized for German insistence on austerity during the Greek debt crisis and the subsequent pressure on the euro. Since Russia flexed its military muscle by seizing Crimea and meddling in Ukraine in 2014, Ms. Merkel has been the main Western interlocutor to President Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nMs. Merkel has also led her country in abandoning nuclear power, and has moved her conservative party firmly to the center on social policy.\n\nHer personal ratings peaked in 2014 at over 80 percent, when she was handling the Ukraine crisis, according to the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s compilation of readings on the Politbarometer poll since she took office. On that scale, her lowest score was 50 percent in late 2010, when Germany joined European efforts to avert a bankruptcy by Greece."}
