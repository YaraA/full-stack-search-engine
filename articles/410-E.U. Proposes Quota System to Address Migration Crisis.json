Proposes Quota System to Address Migration Crisis", "authors": ["James Kanter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/world/europe/european-union-migration-refugees-quota-proposal.html", "body": "Strong anti-immigration sentiment has helped fuel the rise of nationalist, populist political movements in many nations. Continued economic problems across much of the Continent have left many nations cautious about taking on new costs. And proposals for military actions against smuggling have met with a cautious response.\n\nVideo\n\nThe resulting slow response has highlighted the limits of the bloc\u2019s ability to mobilize in unison to confront big problems. In this case, Britain, Hungary and the Czech Republic signaled opposition to the quota plan even before it had been formally proposed.\n\nAs part of a so-called European Agenda on Migration, the quota system would primarily help Greece, Italy and Malta, which are among the main arrival points for the large number of migrants making the dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean. Hundreds of thousands are expected to chance the crossing this year; an estimated 1,800 people have died so far.\n\nA separate plan, to be discussed on Monday by European Union foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels, will address the use of military force aimed at preventing trafficking by destroying vessels before they leave North Africa.\n\nEuropean Union leaders are expected to decide in June on the plan for quotas, which calls for the 28 member states to take in numbers of migrants relative to the states\u2019 size and economic circumstances.\n\nMs. Mogherini said the migration proposals represented a \u201cbold agenda\u201d that should \u201caddress the plight of those escaping from wars, persecution and poverty.\u201d Migration, she said, \u201cis a shared responsibility\u201d for all member states.\n\nGianni Pittella, an Italian lawmaker at the European Parliament, said the announcement showed \u201cEurope is waking up\u201d after \u201ca shameful delay.\u201d\n\nJohn Dalhuisen, the director for Europe and Central Asia for Amnesty International, said the European Commission had taken \u201ca first step in shifting its Fortress Europe attitude towards the refugee crisis.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA senior United Nations refugee agency official called the European Commission proposal \u201ca great breakthrough\u201d at a time of record levels of displacement worldwide.\n\n\u201cSolidarity among E.U. member states in the approach is the only way that a problem of this nature can be tackled,\u201d said Volker Turk, assistant high commissioner for protection at the United Nations refugee agency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
