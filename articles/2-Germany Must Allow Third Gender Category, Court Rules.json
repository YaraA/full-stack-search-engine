{"title": "Germany Must Allow Third Gender Category, Court Rules", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy", "Jessica Bennett"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/europe/germany-third-gender-category-vanja.html", "body": "Thailand recognizes a third gender in its Constitution but has not yet made that an option on government documents.\n\nIn June, for the first time in Canada, a newborn was issued a health document without a gender: a health card that listed U as the gender, for unspecified or unknown. In August, Canada began issuing passports with a third gender option, designated with an X.\n\nSeveral American states have offered residents gender-neutral options on drivers licenses, and last month, California passed a law that allows nonbinary and intersex people a nonbinary category on their birth certificates.\n\nWhile much of the change worldwide has involved transgender people, the discussion has also focused attention on intersex people, those born with traits of both sexes.\n\n\u201cChildren who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery,\u201d a 2013 report from the United Nations special rapporteur on torture found, noting that they were left \u201cwith permanent, irreversible infertility and causing severe mental suffering.\u201d Human Rights Watch has condemned such procedures.\n\nHayley Gorenberg, general counsel at Lambda Legal, said the German ruling appeared to give parents of intersex children the option to wait until the child was old enough to determine which gender, if any, to identify with.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be very clearly about not forcing people into a particular gender marker label, and I think that\u2019s very important,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is, just like any other personal characteristics, gender is on a spectrum and not everybody falls into the binary category of male or female.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Wednesday, the Constitutional Court overturned the lower court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in Germany, people who are neither male nor female are legally protected,\u201d said Moritz Schmidt, a spokesman for Third Option. \u201cWe hope that this success will be used to fight against discrimination wherever inter- and transgender people still suffer disadvantages due to their gender.\u201d\n\nA United Nations study estimated the intersex population at 0.5 percent to 1.7 percent of the global population. In the United States, according to one estimate, transgender people made up 0.6 percent of the adult population, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really positive development in that it\u2019s basically the state acknowledging that bodies are diverse, and that the shoehorning of bodies into pink or blue can do a kind of violence,\u201d said Susan Stryker, an associate professor of gender and women\u2019s studies at the University of Arizona and the author of \u201cTransgender History: The Roots of Today\u2019s Revolution,\u201d said of the Germany ruling. \u201cBut I don\u2019t necessarily see this ruling as something that\u2019s a huge victory in the battle for gender liberation. It\u2019s still very much about medicalization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Gorenberg said of the field, \u201cIt\u2019s all moving in the same direction, but not fast enough.\u201d"}
