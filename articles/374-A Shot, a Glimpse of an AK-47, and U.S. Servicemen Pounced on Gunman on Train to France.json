The attack took place in Oignies, near the historic town of Arras.\n\n\u201cI heard a gunshot,\u201d Chris Norman, a British consultant who helps African entrepreneurs find financing in Europe, said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. \u201cI heard a window shatter. I saw an employee run down the train. I saw a man holding an AK-47.\u201d\n\nInterior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve of France identified the suspect Saturday as a 26-year-old Moroccan man known to the Spanish authorities as a member of \u201cthe radical Islamist movement.\u201d Mr. Cazeneuve, however, cautioned that the French police had not fully confirmed his identity. French officials had identified the man as a security risk, but he was not under surveillance and had apparently spent little time in France.\n\nBy Saturday evening, having left the hospital in Lille where he was operated on after being severely cut by the suspect, Mr. Stone and his friends were being hailed as heroes by French officials and citizens. Some were proposing them for the Legion of Honor. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France had already invited them to \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace for a congratulatory meeting. The French passenger who initially encountered the attacker was also lauded by French officials for his bravery, but was not named.\n\nNorth Sea Thalys high-speed train routes GERMANY Amsterdam BRITAIN NETHERLANDS Essen Brussels Cologne Lille Li\u00e8ge English Channel BELGIUM Arras LUXEMBOURG FRANCE Paris 100 Miles\n\nPresident Obama called the three Americans \u201cto commend and congratulate them for their courage and quick action,\u201d a spokesman, Eric Schultz, said. And Mr. Hollande spoke with Mr. Obama by phone, \u201cthanking him warmly\u201d for the \u201cexemplary conduct of the American citizens\u201d who had prevented \u201can extremely serious act,\u201d the \u00c9lys\u00e9e said in a statement.\n\nThere was no thought of heroism as the men sprang into action, however. \u201cWhat happened and what we did, it just feels unreal,\u201d Mr. Skarlatos said in the Skype interview. \u201cIt felt like a dream, or a movie.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the train carriage, Mr. Stone was the first to act, jumping up at the command of Mr. Skarlatos. He sprinted through the carriage toward the gunman, running \u201ca good 10 meters to get to the guy,\u201d Mr. Skarlatos said. Mr. Stone was unarmed; his target was visibly bristling with weapons.\n\nWith Mr. Skarlatos close behind, Mr. Stone grabbed the gunman\u2019s neck, stunning him. But the gunman fought back furiously, slashing with his blade, slicing Mr. Stone in the neck and hand and nearly severing his thumb. Mr. Stone did not let go.\n\nThe gunman \u201cpulled out a cutter, started cutting Spencer,\u201d Mr. Norman, the British consultant, told television interviewers. \u201cHe cut Spencer behind the neck. He nearly cut his thumb off.\u201d\n\nMr. Skarlatos grabbed the gunman\u2019s Luger pistol and threw it to the side. Incongruously, the gunman yelled at the men to return it, even as Mr. Stone was choking him. A train conductor rushed up and grabbed the gunman\u2019s left arm, Mr. Norman recalled.\n\nThe AK-47 had fallen to the gunman\u2019s feet. Mr. Skarlatos picked it up and \u201cstarted muzzle-thumping him in the head with it,\u201d he said.\n\nBy then, an alarm had sounded on the train. Jean-Hugues Anglade, a well-known French actor, had broken the glass to set it off, cutting himself in the process. The train began to slow down. Julia Grunberg, a Brazilian student living in the Netherlands, looked up from her book. \u201cIt was all very normal,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, suddenly, the alarm started ringing. We were very fast; then we were very slow.\u201d\n\nMr. Anglade accused the train personnel on Saturday of having fled the scene of the struggle, abandoning the passengers and cowering in the engine car. He told the French news media that the behavior of the staff had been \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cinhuman.\u201d\n\nMr. Norman and Mr. Sadler had joined in the efforts to subdue the gunman, who \u201cput up quite a bit of a fight,\u201d Mr. Norman recalled at the news conference in Arras on Saturday. \u201cMy thought was, \u2018I\u2019m probably going to die anyway, so let\u2019s go.\u2019 Once you start moving, you\u2019re not afraid anymore.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Stone, wounded and bleeding, kept the suspect in a chokehold. \u201cSpencer Stone is a very strong guy,\u201d Mr. Norman said. The suspect passed out. Mr. Norman busied himself binding him up with a tie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Skarlatos, the AK-47 in hand, began to patrol the carriages, looking for other gunmen. He made a series of startling discoveries: The suspect\u2019s guns had malfunctioned, and he had not had the competence to fix them.\n\n\u201cHe had pulled the trigger on the AK. The primer was just faulty, so the gun didn\u2019t go off, luckily,\u201d Mr. Skarlatos said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t know how to fix it, which is also very lucky.\u201d In addition, the gunman had not been able to load his own handgun: \u201cThere was no magazine in it, so he either dropped it accidentally or didn\u2019t load it properly, so he was only able to get what appeared to be one shot off,\u201d Mr. Skarlatos said.\n\nBleeding heavily, Mr. Stone went to the aid of a gunshot victim, Mr. Sadler said. \u201cEven though he was injured, he went to help the other man who was injured,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout his help, he would have died.\u201d\n\nSlowly, the train pulled into the Arras station. \u201cSomebody came in,\u201d Ms. Grunberg recalled, and told passengers, \u201cYou have to get off the train.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I was leaving the train,\u201d she said, \u201cI saw someone in a wheelchair, police dogs. It was all very confusing.\u201d\n\nAll those who took part realized it could have turned out far worse. \u201cI mean, if that guy\u2019s weapon had been functioning properly,\u201d Mr. Skarlatos said, \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about how it would have went.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cI heard a gunshot,\u201d Chris Norman, a British consultant who helps African entrepreneurs find financing in Europe, said at a news conference Saturday afternoon.By Saturday evening, having left the hospital in Lille where he was operated on after being severely cut by the suspect, Mr. Stone and his friends were being hailed as heroes by French officials and citizens.North Sea Thalys high-speed train routes GERMANY Amsterdam BRITAIN NETHERLANDS Essen Brussels Cologne Lille Li\u00e8ge English Channel BELGIUM Arras LUXEMBOURG FRANCE Paris 100 MilesAnd Mr. Hollande spoke with Mr. Obama by phone, \u201cthanking him warmly\u201d for the \u201cexemplary conduct of the American citizens\u201d who had prevented \u201can extremely serious act,\u201d the \u00c9lys\u00e9e said in a statement.Mr. Anglade accused the train personnel on Saturday of having fled the scene of the struggle, abandoning the passengers and cowering in the engine car."}
