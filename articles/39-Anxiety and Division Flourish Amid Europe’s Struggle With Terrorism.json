So did a spike in European anti-Semitism originally ascribed to the fighting in Gaza last summer.\n\nMuslims, too, have felt neglected. \u201cSadly,\u201d Areeb Ullah, a student leader in London, said in an open letter to Mr. Pickles, \u201cit seems the only time you engage with us is under the rubric of counterterrorism.\u201d\n\nEven the most senior intelligence officials, however, acknowledge that counterterrorism measures alone will not keep Britons safe. \u201cAt some point these threats will get through, and there will be another terrorist attack in this country,\u201d John Sawers, a former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 overseas spy agency, said this week.\n\nIn some ways, the peril \u2014 difficult to detect among loosely organized or so-called lone-wolf militants \u2014 lies in the conflation of two conflicts: Disaffection among Muslim minorities in Europe has inspired thousands of young jihadists to join militant groups in Syria and Iraq as combatants, threatening to turn their homelands into second fronts when they return.\n\nFor years Europeans have wrestled with rival approaches to absorbing those they thought of as outsiders. The results have been ambivalent at best. And now, Mr. Valls, the French prime minister, said, \u201cwe must add all the divisions, the tensions that have been brewing too long and which we discuss only intermittently.\u201d He was alluding to his own country, but the message, like the shootings two weeks ago, resonated much farther afield.", "summary": "Even before the three-day convulsion of violence began on Jan. 7, aimed first at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and then at a police officer and Jewish shoppers, there had been clear signs of growing and hazardous polarization. \u201cSadly,\u201d Areeb Ullah, a student leader in London, said in an open letter to Mr. Pickles, \u201cit seems the only time you engage with us is under the rubric of counterterrorism.\u201d \u201cAt some point these threats will get through, and there will be another terrorist attack in this country,\u201d John Sawers, a former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 overseas spy agency, said this week.
