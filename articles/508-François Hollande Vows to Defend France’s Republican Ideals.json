{"title": "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande Vows to Defend France\u2019s Republican Ideals", "authors": ["Dan Bilefsky"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/world/europe/hollande-vows-to-defend-frances-republican-ideals.html", "body": "Mr. Hollande also announced that he would travel to Kiev, Ukraine, on Thursday with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to seek a joint solution to the conflict there, one that he said would be based on Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. He said he would discuss the Ukraine crisis with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday.\n\nMr. Hollande has been one of the most unpopular presidents in French history, but what is seen as his empathetic and decisive handling of the attacks has bolstered his standing with voters, at least temporarily. Opinion polls in France show his approval ratings rising sharply after the attacks.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Hollande faces huge challenges leading up to the presidential elections in 2017, including a stagnant economy, high unemployment and growing alarm about the threat of homegrown Islamic extremism, as well as a perceived rise in anti-Semitic violence.\n\nAt the same time, the state security apparatus is facing questions about its failure to prevent the attacks, made all the more vivid by the stabbing on Tuesday of three soldiers guarding a Jewish community center in Nice by a man whom counterterrorism police had interrogated only days before.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

French officials met with the new Greek finance minister on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe role of France is to find a solution, to help find an agreement which respects the vote of the Greek people, but which also respects European rules and commitments,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. He noted that no European Union country, France included, had asked the Greeks to leave the eurozone.\n\nFrance is still struggling to come to terms with last month\u2019s terrorist attacks, in which gunmen laid siege to a satirical newspaper and a kosher supermarket, killing 17 people and convulsing the country.\n\nThe government has announced plans to spend an additional 425 million euros, or more than $490 million, to create over 2,500 jobs to improve counterterrorism operations and to help monitor nearly 3,000 people the police consider surveillance targets. The government has also been expanding its efforts to combat jihadist indoctrination on the web, and has been seeking to root out jihadist networks with a series of recent arrests.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe developments also come at a time of deep turbulence in French politics, with both the right and left suffering from internal divisions and the far-right National Front gaining strength, as its anti-immigrant message resonates with renewed vigor after the attacks.\n\nIn addition to being encumbered by a stagnant economy, Mr. Hollande\u2019s Socialist government is facing a simmering rebellion by leftist members opposed to its plans for fostering growth and employment. When the government announced modest economic changes in December, including allowing more retail stores to open on Sundays, leading members of his own party denounced the proposals as threatening France\u2019s cherished social protections.\n\nMr. Hollande said the terrorist attacks had altered him. Alluding to the rise in his popularity, he said that he would not be hostage to polls. \u201cI have inevitably changed after these events,\u201d he said. \u201cIt transforms you, necessarily, because this ordeal has also changed our country.\u201d", "summary": "Nevertheless, Mr. Hollande faces huge challenges leading up to the presidential elections in 2017, including a stagnant economy, high unemployment and growing alarm about the threat of homegrown Islamic extremism, as well as a perceived rise in anti-Semitic violence.
