The government is now moving to empower Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court to suspend Catalan politicians who violate Spanish law.\n\nBut while the standoff could have profound implications for Spain \u2014 Catalonia is Spain\u2019s most economically powerful region \u2014 and affect other separatist movements in the European Union, it has also become a tool for its main participants to elevate their own standing ahead of national parliamentary elections on Dec. 20.\n\nThe dispute has allowed Mr. Rajoy, who faces a fragmentation of Spain\u2019s political landscape as the vote approaches, to present himself as the guardian of Spain\u2019s integrity.\n\nThe independence declaration announced Tuesday is designed to allow Catalonia to set up its own institutions and eventually adopt its own constitution. It also includes a defiant claim that the Catalan march toward nationhood should not be subject to approval by Spanish institutions, not even the country\u2019s Constitutional Court.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m president of the government, Spain will continue to be a nation of people free and equal,\u201d Mr. Rajoy said in response. \u201cEverybody will be subject to the law and the decision of the courts.\u201d\n\nBut each step taken by Mr. Rajoy against Mr. Mas has also allowed the Catalonia leader to enhance his own stature, in a dynamic that has added further momentum to the dispute.\n\nThis month, Mr. Mas made a court appearance related to an independence vote in Catalonia \u2014 which was declared illegal by the Constitutional Court \u2014 using it as a platform to amplify his ambitions and calling the prosecution, in effect, nonsensical.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After a separate raid last week of the Convergence headquarters, Mr. Mas said that he and his party were \u201ctargets for big game hunters.\u201d\n\nPredictably, Madrid\u2019s explanation is exactly the opposite. \u201cThe whole process of separatism has been an attempt to cover up the corruption in Catalonia,\u201d said Pablo Casado, a spokesman for Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party.\n\nThe latest separatist agreement was announced after Mr. Mas called a regional election in Catalonia last month, which he billed as a de facto vote on secession. Separatist parties won the most parliamentary seats, but fell short of a majority of the votes.\n\nThe standoff has created \u201can unprecedented political and constitutional dispute,\u201d said Manuel Mu\u00f1iz, a Spanish teaching fellow at Oxford University\u2019s Blavatnik School of Government.\n\nIn the medium term, he said, \u201cit\u2019s more worrying evidence of a conservative government that hasn\u2019t really understood the cultural diversity of Spain and believes that reducing the issue to a purely legal one can be a substitute for much-needed political dialogue.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added, in the longer term, \u201cI think Catalonia could turn into something even more dramatic: a dispute that hurts the whole concept of a united and cosmopolitan Europe.\u201d"}
