{"title": "In Shadow of \u2018Brexit,\u2019 NATO Will Sound Message of Unity Against Russia", "authors": ["Rick Lyman"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/world/europe/nato-brexit-russia.html", "body": "\u201cNATO is the last European institution standing, and it is the main link between Europe and North America,\u201d said Jakub Grygiel, a professor of international studies at Johns Hopkins University and a senior fellow in residence at the Center for European Policy Analysis. \u201cHence, NATO is likely to become more important as the E.U. weakens, because it will continue to serve as a mechanism of coordination and cooperation.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nUnder an agreement expected to be ratified at the summit meeting, four battalions of 800 to 1,200 troops each would be stationed in countries bordering Russia in what is being called a \u201cpersistent rotation\u201d that makes the NATO presence essentially permanent. Each multinational battalion will be in position for six months, but will not depart before replacements have arrived.\n\nBritain has agreed to take command of a battalion to be based in Estonia and Germany and one in Lithuania. American troops are expected to make up the bulk of a force to be stationed in Poland and commanded by the United States.\n\nWhile NATO struggled for months to find a country to take command of the fourth battalion, to be based in Latvia, Canada is now widely expected to emerge during the summit meeting as that group\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cSince 1999, when Poland joined NATO, this is the most important summit for us,\u201d said Tomasz Szatkowski, Poland\u2019s deputy minister of defense. \u201cIt provides for the actual presence of Western allies in Poland.\u201d\n\nIn addition, under the plan agreed to in advance of the summit meeting, an entire brigade comprising four more battalions would operate on a roaming basis throughout the front line from the Baltics to Bulgaria \u2014 though the details, including where such a force would be based, remain to be hammered out.\n\nOf course, another topic sure to be discussed is the American presidential election campaign, in which the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, has expressed doubts about the continued need for NATO and questioned whether the United States was being properly compensated for the military forces it has stationed across the globe.\n\nNATO at a Glance\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone will say it publicly, but I cannot imagine it will not be part of the private discussions,\u201d Mr. Baranowski said. \u201cA world with both Brexit and Trump? Holy moley, hold onto your pants.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the previous NATO summit meeting in Wales in 2014, not long after Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea, the alliance announced the creation of a new rapid-reaction force that could move swiftly into a threatened region and, using previously positioned caches of weapons and equipment, delay an invading force until full NATO forces could arrive.\n\nBut with Russia\u2019s continued belligerence, front-line governments, spearheaded by Poland and the Baltic states, pushed for a more robust posture this time around.\n\nWhat they are getting, while below their fondest hopes, does elevate NATO\u2019s strategy to what is being called \u201cenhanced forward presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been described as a speed bump,\u201d Mr. Baranowski said. \u201cBut what it does is raise the price for the Russians.\u201d\n\nThe Russians would still have a massive advantage in troops \u2014 five or six times the number \u2014 and weaponry. But any incursion into the Baltics or Poland would put the Russian military in immediate contact with multinational NATO troops.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Senior European Union and NATO officials will get together, as will union leaders and American officials.\n\n\u201cUsually, that E.U.-U.S. meeting at these summits is fairly low key,\u201d Mr. Baranowski said. \u201cBut now, because of Brexit, it\u2019s a much bigger deal.\u201d\n\nThe larger question, Mr. Kuzniar said, is how Poland and other front-line states will respond to this \u201cnew strategic reality,\u201d with NATO troops stationed in their territory, though not in the numbers they desired.\n\n\u201cWill they develop more effective territorial defense forces and capabilities of their own?\u201d he asked. \u201cWill they seek offensive weapons to threaten Russian assets? Or will they accommodate Russia in some form?\u201d", "summary": "In addition, under the plan agreed to in advance of the summit meeting, an entire brigade comprising four more battalions would operate on a roaming basis throughout the front line from the Baltics to Bulgaria \u2014 though the details, including where such a force would be based, remain to be hammered out.
