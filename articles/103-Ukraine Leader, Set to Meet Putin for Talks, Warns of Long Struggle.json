{"title": "Ukraine Leader, Set to Meet Putin for Talks, Warns of Long Struggle", "authors": ["Andrew Higgins"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/world/europe/ukraine-russia.html", "body": "Mr. Poroshenko said in his speech that Ukraine, which is nearly bankrupt, would nonetheless spend nearly $3 billion over the next three years to re-equip its army. \u201cIt is clear that in the foreseeable future, unfortunately, a constant military threat will hang over Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments appeared to signal Ukraine\u2019s determination to fight on, despite warnings from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany that the crisis in the east could not be solved by force of arms alone, and despite a call on Sunday from the International Committee of the Red Cross for an end to the shelling of civilian areas.\n\nMr. Poroshenko\u2019s emphasis on Ukraine\u2019s military revival also set the stage for what are expected to be tough talks on Tuesday between Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Putin in Minsk, the Belarus capital, where they will be joined by officials from the European Union. Both leaders face strong pressure from nationalists at home not to make concessions, as the fighting around Donetsk and another besieged rebel stronghold, Luhansk, grows increasingly bloody.\n\nThe government in Kiev and its Western supporters say the rebels are encouraged, financed and armed by Russia, and there have been repeated sighting of military hardware and fighters passing into Ukraine from Russia. Even so, Moscow denies playing any role in the conflict.\n\nThe announcement last week that Mr. Putin and Mr. Poroshenko would meet in Minsk, their first encounter since a frosty meeting during D-Day commemorations in France in June, stirred hopes of a negotiated settlement to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which has killed more than 2,000 people and led Russia to accuse Ukraine of creating a humanitarian catastrophe through its offensive against the rebels.\n\nBut so far, Russia has shown no sign of moving away from a position that became a major obstacle in previous talks between lower-ranking Ukrainian and Russian officials: its insistence that it has nothing to do with the pro-Russian rebels and does not control them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ukraine says it is willing to give eastern regions more autonomy, but it has ruled out letting them join Russia or become independent.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said on Sunday that a humanitarian crisis was developing in the region, particularly in Luhansk, where Russia sent a huge convoy of trucks on Friday over the objections of Kiev. \u201cClearly, people living there need help,\u201d Laurent Corbaz, the organization\u2019s head of operations for Europe and Central Asia, said in a statement. \u201cFood and medicine are in short supply, and access to clean water is very difficult. It is urgent to improve the situation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Corbaz also called for an end to what he called \u201cintermittent shelling of residential areas\u201d in Luhansk, adding that \u201cthis action endangers the lives of civilians, including humanitarian workers.\u201d He did not say which forces were doing the shelling, but much of it appears to come from Ukrainian forces outside the city, in response to firing on their positions by the rebels.\n\nRussia sent more than 200 trucks into Luhansk on Friday without Red Cross escorts, in violation of agreements. The Kremlin said the step was necessary to deliver food, water and other supplies to needy residents in Luhansk, but Ukraine and the West denounced it as an illegal provocation. The trucks returned to Russia on Saturday without incident.\n\nThe Red Cross said its staff still had not been able to reach Luhansk because talks with all sides in the conflict had failed \u201cto secure sufficient security guarantees for safe passage.\u201d But it said it was advising local authorities in the rebel-held city about how to distribute aid delivered from Russia.\n\nKiev residents who turned out on Sunday to cheer their army expressed deep skepticism about the chances of a deal with Mr. Putin to curtail the conflict. \u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate with the Russians \u2014 they deny everything \u2014 but we know whom we are fighting,\u201d said Antonina Vasilenko, who watched the parade with a Ukrainian flag draped around her shoulders.\n\nShe said she and her husband, Sergei, had never taken part in previous Independence Day celebrations, but they decided this year that they needed to display their patriotism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want war, but we need victory in the east,\u201d Sergei Vasilenko said. \u201cWe must defeat these fighters from Russia.\u201d\n\nMr. Poroshenko did not name Russia directly in his speech, but he left little doubt that he saw Moscow as the source of the conflict. \u201cThis war was not our initiative \u2014 it was imposed on us from outside,\u201d he said, adding that Ukraine\u2019s borders had been violated by a foreign power \u201cwithout a declaration of war.\u201d\n\nHe compared recent events to those of the 1930s, when Nazi Germany stirred up ethnic Germans living in neighboring countries to create a pretext for invasion."}
