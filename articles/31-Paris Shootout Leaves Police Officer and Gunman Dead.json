Neumann, the director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIt seems prepared and coordinated,\u201d Mr. Neumann added, noting that the Islamic State claim was in multiple languages, \u201clike they knew this was going to happen.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, two men were arrested in Marseille on suspicion of having imminent plans to conduct a terrorist attack. Weapons, ammunition and the highly volatile explosive TATP, or triacetone triperoxide, was found in one of the apartments used by the two men. It is the same type of explosive used in the attack at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in November 2015 and in the attacks in Brussels in March 2016.\n\nThe response of all the candidates was to express solidarity with the police, and Mr. Fillon, who represents the mainstream right, and Ms. Le Pen said they would not campaign on Friday, out of respect for the police officers who were killed and wounded.\n\nEmmanuel Macron, a centrist who along with Ms. Le Pen has been leading in the polls, stepped back from the moment, saying: \u201cThis imponderable threat, this threat, will be a fact of daily life in the coming years.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, who was meeting with Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy at the White House on Thursday, responded to a question from reporters about the Paris attack. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible thing, and it\u2019s a very, very terrible thing that\u2019s going on in the world today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it looks like another terrorist attack. And what can you say \u2014 it just never ends.\u201d\n\nThe French presidential candidates were not alone in using the attack to burnish their image as potential commanders in chief; the Islamic State also appeared eager to make the most of the it, preparing a statement in multiple languages and being ready to claim responsibility, said Michael S. Smith II, a terrorism analyst who specializes in the Islamic State\u2019s influence efforts and who is writing a book on its external operations.\n\n\u201cThe timing of the attack itself is significant in that this will help to ensure the group is a centerpiece of political discourses in France,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cFor prospective recruits in the West and seasoned jihadis in conflict zones alike, including the Al Qaeda members that the Islamic State has sought to draw into its ranks, this can bolster perceptions of the group as a credible enterprise that is worthy of their support.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Molins, who handles terrorism investigations nationwide, said the authorities had identified the killer, but he declined to provide the gunman\u2019s identity because police raids and the search for potential accomplices were still underway.
