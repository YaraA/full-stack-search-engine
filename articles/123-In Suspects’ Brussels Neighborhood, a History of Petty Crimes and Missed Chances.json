But by his own account, he, too, managed to slip in and out of Belgium without being arrested, despite being stopped at one point by an officer who \u201clet me go, as he did not see the resemblance\u201d to photos of himself published in the Belgian news media.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPosing for pictures holding an Islamic State flag and the Quran, Mr. Abaaoud boasted in an interview this year with the militant group\u2019s magazine, Dabiq, of outsmarting security services. \u201cWe spent months trying to find a way into Europe, and by Allah\u2019s strength, we succeeded in finally making our way to Belgium,\u201d he said.\n\nLatest Updates\n\nHe added, \u201cWe were then able to obtain weapons and set up a safe house while we planned to carry out operations against the crusaders.\u201d\n\nOne of their biggest allies, however, may have been a Belgian security system ill equipped to deal with a tight knit community like Molenbeek, where a mostly white police force has only tenuous links to a largely immigrant population resentful of being labeled potential terrorists.\n\nThe police have on occasion pounced, but mostly for petty crimes unrelated to Islamist extremism.\n\nIbrahim Abdeslam, the bar operator turned suicide bomber, was convicted of criminal activities as far back as 2010, and even stood trial for minor offenses with Mr. Abaaoud, according to a people briefed on information from the federal prosecutor\u2019s office. The mayor of Molenbeek, Fran\u00e7oise Schepmans, said Mr. Abdeslam had been convicted of crimes involving drugs.\n\n\u201cThis is a small place; we all crossed paths with them,\u201d the deputy mayor of Molenbeek, Ahmed el Khannouss, said Monday, referring to the three suspects from the district. But, he added, \u201cwe are all totally shocked that they could have been involved in something so terrible.\u201d\n\nFamily members and friends voiced complete surprise, too, highlighting how difficult it is to penetrate a small group of determined jihadists.\n\nMohamed Abdeslam, the brother of one of the Paris suicide bombers, was picked up on Saturday by the police and released on Monday. An employee with the municipal government, he told reporters in Molenbeek on Monday that he first learned of his brother\u2019s extremist affiliations from news media reports of the Paris attacks.\n\nHe said he previously knew \u201cabsolutely nothing, absolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nThe father of Mr. Abaaoud was so shocked and appalled by his son\u2019s embrace of violent jihadism that he sued him in Belgium in May, asserting that the son had \u201ckidnapped\u201d another sibling, who was just 13, and lured him to Syria.\n\n\u201cIf there is anyone who is certainly not aware of what is going on, it\u2019s the father,\u201d said the father\u2019s lawyer, Nathalie Gallant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe terrorists not only hid their radical views and intentions, but they also benefited from Belgium\u2019s large pool of angry Muslim youths and its longstanding role as a center for the illegal arms trade. The tiny country has seen more than 400 of its citizens leave to fight in Syria, the highest per capita number in Europe.\n\n\u201cLong before jihadism was on the scene, Belgium was a hub for illegal gunrunning,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Belgium \u201cis considered to be the weak link in Europe\u2019s approach to tackling terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nBelgium is also divided into three different languages and cultures, Mr. Van Buuren said, which makes it hard for agencies to communicate and coordinate with one another, including the sharing of intelligence.\n\nCrucially, Belgium\u2019s strict laws on surveillance, including the interception of telephone conversations, make it hard for the authorities to monitor potential terrorists.\n\nIn contrast, he said, France has wider surveillance on terrorist suspects. \u201cYou know that the chances of being discovered are not high in Belgium,\u201d Mr. Van Buuren said. \u201cMeanwhile, Brussels is just a few hundred kilometers away and shares the same French language, and you can plan very easily from there. So why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nYet the French intelligence service has recently fared little better.\n\nA French official briefed on the investigation said Mr. Abaaoud had mentioned plans to attack \u201ca concert hall\u201d to a French citizen who had come back from Syria three months ago and was interrogated by security officials.\n\nMr. Abaaoud, the official said, was also in contact with Isma\u00ebl Omar Mostefa\u00ef, another of last week\u2019s Paris attackers. Mr. Mostefa\u00ef traveled to Turkey in 2013, Turkish officials said, and is believed to have crossed into Syria.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis name was flagged to French officials twice, in December and again in June, Turkish officials said. But until after Friday\u2019s attack, there was never any follow-up, they said.\n\nThe two brothers who fatally shot 12 people in the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January were well known to the authorities in the United States and France and had been under surveillance for long stretches. They struck just a few months after the authorities let the wiretap on their phones expire.\n\nIntelligence officials said there were now so many Europeans either in Syria or with links to Syria that to follow them all had become impossible. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got the resources,\u201d one senior European official said.\n\nBut many of these extremists have clustered in a small area, a phenomenon that has long been noticed by terrorism experts. Few areas have been linked to quite so many bloody episodes as Molenbeek, which is relatively poor with a high unemployment rate but, far from a slum, is full of handsome homes, galleries and restaurants along with halal butchers and kebab houses.\n\nMany of the people linked to a suspected terrorist hide-out broken up in January in eastern Belgian came from Molenbeek.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmedy Coulibaly, who was involved in the Charlie Hebdo attack and an assault on shoppers in a Jewish supermarket in Paris, is believed to have bought weapons in Molenbeek. So did Mehdi Nemmouche, a Frenchman who targeted Jews at a Brussels museum in 2014, killing four. Ayoub el Khazzani, a Moroccan, who was thwarted in his attempt to attack passengers on a high-speed train traveling between Brussels in Paris in August, is also thought to have lived there for a while.\n\nBut many locals still believe their neighborhood has been unfairly maligned. \u201cThis is not a Molenbeek problem; it is a global problem,\u201d said Mustafa Zoufri, who directs a local youth center.\n\nLocal officials on Monday denied turning a blind eye to extremism. The mayor, Ms. Schepmans, whose office looks out on the government-owned apartment building where Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s family lived, insisted that while there might have been a period of \u201cdenial\u201d under her predecessor, her own administration had \u201cworked hard to fight radicalization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, she acknowledged that while officials and police officers kept tabs on formally registered mosques, a plethora of small worship halls operated in the shadows with little supervision.\n\nOn Monday, scores of armed officers wearing black face masks sealed off a street that runs by the district\u2019s biggest mosque as they hunted, in vain, for Salah Abdeslam, who rented the car used in the attacks.\n\nAs reporters from around the world swarmed into the borough\u2019s cobblestoned square, a resident screamed at them, denouncing the news media and security officials for linking her neighborhood to terrorism.\n\n\u201cYou are all scum,\u201d she shouted. \u201cDo you have no shame?\u201d", "summary": "One of their biggest allies, however, may have been a Belgian security system ill equipped to deal with a tight knit community like Molenbeek, where a mostly white police force has only tenuous links to a largely immigrant population resentful of being labeled potential terrorists.Ibrahim Abdeslam, the bar operator turned suicide bomber, was convicted of criminal activities as far back as 2010, and even stood trial for minor offenses with Mr. Abaaoud, according to a people briefed on information from the federal prosecutor\u2019s office.Terrorists planning to carry out an attack find it much easier to coordinate and procure weapons from Belgium than anywhere else in Europe, said Jelle van Buuren, a lecturer in counterterrorism at Leiden University in the Netherlands.Few areas have been linked to quite so many bloody episodes as Molenbeek, which is relatively poor with a high unemployment rate but, far from a slum, is full of handsome homes, galleries and restaurants along with halal butchers and kebab houses.On Monday, scores of armed officers wearing black face masks sealed off a street that runs by the district\u2019s biggest mosque as they hunted, in vain, for Salah Abdeslam, who rented the car used in the attacks."}
