The chancellor\u2019s office on Thursday declined to reveal her age or last name.\n\nShe was among 32 mostly teenage students who were assembled Wednesday in the Baltic port of Rostock for one of the chancellor\u2019s sessions in a listening campaign called Gut Leben in Deutschland, or Living Well in Germany.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But that policy may well result in more deportations.\n\nWhen Reem starts to cry, Ms. Merkel approaches her, pats her on the shoulder and praises her for her articulate presentation of her family\u2019s plight.\n\nBy Thursday, the video of the encounter had provoked criticism of Ms. Merkel as hardhearted and was trending on Twitter under the hashtag #merkelstreichelt, a reference to the chancellor\u2019s effort to comfort the girl.\n\nBut the chancellor also had her defenders, including Ines Pohl, a well-known journalist and the former editor of the leftist daily known as Taz.\n\nMs. Merkel could have taken the political path and offered some individual examination of the case of Reem\u2019s family, Ms. Pohl wrote. Instead, \u201cthe chancellor was honest and certainly not cold.\u201d"}
