Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s plan ultimately failed.\n\nThis time around, he has promised more market-oriented reforms and has vowed not to back down in the face of inevitable protests. In that regard, the technocratic Mr. Jupp\u00e9, of all the contenders, may present the biggest challenge to France\u2019s social protections and labor rules.\n\nThe governing Socialists, saddled with a poor economic record and an unpopular incumbent president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, are already being written off.\n\nThe race is considered the right\u2019s to lose. Just behind Mr. Sarkozy in the polls, nipping at his heels, is another former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe winner of Sunday\u2019s Republican primary \u2014 there will be a runoff on Nov. 27 \u2014 is considered likely to face Ms. Le Pen in April\u2019s presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf previous patterns hold, Ms. Le Pen will be defeated, which would make Mr. Jupp\u00e9 the likeliest of all those now running to become the next French president.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday by Emmanuel Macron, a popular former economy minister in the Socialist government, that he, too, will enter the presidential race is unlikely to change the right and far-right dynamic, in the eyes of many observers.\n\nAt 38, Mr. Macron has the image of a youthful reformer, but analysts have noted his thin record, lack of a party base, and absence of heft \u2014 he has never held elected office \u2014 in a universe of surging populism.\n\nMr. Jupp\u00e9, on the other hand, has won and lost numerous elections and has served for many years as the mayor of Bordeaux, where he has been credited with transforming the city.\n\nBut, with near-permanent high unemployment, an injection of energy from Mr. Trump\u2019s victory into Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign \u2014 xenophobic nationalism is her core theme \u2014 and the same social and economic fractures as in the United States, there are no guarantees.\n\nThe warning signs from across the Atlantic were evident in a campaign swing through Lower Burgundy on Wednesday, as Mr. Jupp\u00e9 met with disgruntled farmers and rural officials.\n\nThe French news media has noted that the American election results have colored the former prime minister\u2019s message with concern about the existence of two Frances: one benefiting from globalization, and the other left behind.\n\nThere are the large, vibrant cities \u2014 Paris, Lyon, Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s Bordeaux \u2014 and then there are the shuttered main streets of sleepy provincial capitals and rural towns like those he visited on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWearing the coat and tie he appears never to shed, Mr. Jupp\u00e9 got his shoes muddy at a grain and dairy farm whose owner complained of crushing debt.\n\n\u201cPeople have talked about suffering,\u201d Mr. Jupp\u00e9 told a roomful in the tiny village of St.-Loup-d\u2019Ordon, \u201cand it is true,\u201d he said, speaking in a knowing, weary tone, careful never to exaggerate.\n\nWith his eyebrows slightly arched, he listened patiently to the complaints. Rural France feels \u201cabandoned\u201d and \u201cdisdained\u201d by Paris, Mr. Jupp\u00e9 said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t accept this gulf between the big cities and rural France.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPromising a \u201cstrong state,\u201d he had a warning for his audience deep in the Burgundian countryside at St.-Julien-du-Sault: \u201cThe world is becoming more and more dangerous. Nationalism is on the rise.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, at a rally this week in northern Paris, the perceived menace of rising populism was a common theme in the speeches and comments of Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s supporters.\n\nFrom Mr. Jupp\u00e9 himself and the other center-right speakers who preceded him, Mr. Trump\u2019s name came up often. Each time, it was met with loud boos from the crowd of around 6,000. Mr. Jupp\u00e9 \u2014 \u201ca man of culture,\u201d one speaker called him \u2014 was depicted as the antithesis of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cAfter the election of Donald Trump, after Brexit, will populism triumph in our country? No!\u201d shouted Patrick Devedjian, a former minister, who introduced Mr. Jupp\u00e9 at the rally.\n\nThe crowd \u2014 mostly middle-aged or older, buttoned-up and carefully dressed, like Mr. Jupp\u00e9 \u2014 roared approval. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it up to here with populist baseness!\u201d Mr. Devedjian said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother supporter, Jean-Christophe Lagarde, a prominent centrist politician, told the crowd, \u201cFrance doesn\u2019t need a mini-Trump in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e!\u201d \u2014 referring to the presidential palace in Paris.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

In a brisk speech that reflected his classical education at France\u2019s top schools, he brought up Mr. Trump in the context of threats to France.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy will be,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cHe has said contradictory things. What I know is, there will be an aggressive commercial policy. So we must be aggressive, too.\u201d\n\nSetting himself up as a defender of European unity \u2014 Ms. Le Pen is fiercely opposed to the European Union \u2014 Mr. Jupp\u00e9 said: \u201cFrance can be a world power, in thrall to nobody. But separated, we will be vassals of the big empires all around us: Russia, China and the U.S.\u201d\n\nAfterward, encountered on the boulevard outside the rally, he wondered whether his comments about Mr. Trump had been too \u201coffensive.\u201d Mr. Jupp\u00e9 has served twice as France\u2019s foreign minister and chooses his words carefully.\n\nBut then he shrugged his shoulders, saying about Mr. Trump, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d", "summary": "But while other contenders for the presidency are adopting Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of Muslims as an inherent threat, Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s soothing message of French unity has, so far, helped him to lead opinion polls.
