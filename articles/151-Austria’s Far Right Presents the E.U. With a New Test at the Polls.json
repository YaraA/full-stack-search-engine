{"title": "Austria\u2019s Far Right Presents the E.U. With a New Test at the Polls", "authors": ["Alison Smale", "James Kanter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/world/europe/austria-president-runoff.html", "body": "The leaders of the European Union are trying to discourage other states from leaving by making Britain\u2019s exit as painful as possible. Still, the growing pressure from angry electorates across Europe may force them to rapidly address the issues that drove more than 17 million Britons to vote to leave: sovereignty, borders and migrants.\n\nThe view that power \u201cneeds to be rebalanced toward capitals is absolutely on the table in light of the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the bloc,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.\n\nHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous desire from all over Europe to win back autonomy and sovereignty from Brussels that is motivated by how out of touch the E.U. has become with the everyday fears and concerns of its citizens.\u201d\n\nIn the Austrian election, the European Union \u201ccould very well become a theme in the coming campaign,\u201d said Hans Rauscher, a columnist for the liberal Austrian newspaper Der Standard.\n\nThe two candidates\u2019 stances on Europe could not be more different. Mr. Hofer is a 45-year-old nationalist who has advocated for the rights of disabled people since he was injured in a paragliding accident. His opponent, Alexander Van der Bellen, a 72-year-old former leader of the Green Party, supports a border-free \u201cUnited States of Europe.\u201d\n\nElected to Parliament in 2006, Mr. Hofer has galvanized voters disillusioned with the two mainstream parties that have governed Austria continually \u2014 and often in coalition \u2014 since the 1950s.\n\nWhen polls closed in the May 22 runoff, Mr. Hofer was leading, but a final count that included about 700,000 postal ballots put Mr. Van der Bellen ahead by roughly 31,000 votes. The leader of Mr. Hofer\u2019s anti-immigration Freedom Party, Heinz-Christian Strache, filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court about irregularities in 94 of 117 electoral districts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe chairman of the Constitutional Court, Gerhart Holzinger, announced on Friday that \u201cthe runoff must be repeated in all of Austria,\u201d and said the decision was guided solely by the court\u2019s mission to protect the rule of law and democracy. The judges described procedural mistakes regarding the timing and monitoring of the counting of some ballots.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlong with promising to hold Austria\u2019s government more accountable, Mr. Hofer and his party campaigned heavily on the migrant issue. Most of the more than one million migrants who reached Germany last year did so on land routes that took them through Austria. More than 90,000 migrants decided to apply for asylum in Austria \u2014 a similar proportion as in Germany, which has 10 times Austria\u2019s population.\n\nBritain\u2019s June 23 referendum \u2014 in which immigration was a central issue \u2014 was the first time a country had decided to quit the European Union, and it bolstered euroskeptic parties across the Continent, including in France, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy.\n\nAfter the British vote, Mr. Hofer said he favored holding a similar referendum in Austria if new efforts to centralize power in Brussels were not halted. On Sunday, he told the newspaper \u00d6sterreich that if the European Union \u201cevolves in the wrong direction, then for me the time would have come to say: So, now we have to ask the Austrians.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Slovakia and other smaller countries have objected to the quota plan devised by European leaders. Germany has insisted that all members of the bloc must do their share to solve what is a common problem.\n\nBut the British vote and the sparks it has ignited among other European electorates are now exerting intense pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and others who favor cautious and collaborative institutional reforms. That stance is arousing increasing resistance from states, and political parties, that want to chart their own path.\n\nOn Friday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, met with Slovakia\u2019s prime minister, Mr. Fico, who has indicated that the member states \u2014 as opposed to Brussels officials \u2014 take a greater role in setting set the strategic direction of the bloc.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNational parliaments have to be heard,\u201d the governments of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, which meet in a bloc known as the Visegrad Group, said in a statement this week.\n\nMr. Fico has criticized the European Union\u2019s leaders for mishandling the migration crisis, for giving France and Germany too much influence, and for doing too much of its business in Brussels. On Friday at a news conference with Mr. Juncker, however, he took a milder tone, saying that while \u201cmigration can be a divisive subject,\u201d Slovakia wishes to create a \u201cscope for discussion.\u201d\n\nSlovakia\u2019s foreign minister, Miroslav Lajcak, said this week that he would \u201csupport any measure\u201d to keep Britain in the bloc, becoming one of the few European officials to raise the possibility of additional concessions.\n\nIn many respects, Slovakia is a major champion of the European project. Brussels has provided huge amounts of funding to develop its infrastructure, and Slovakia is a member of both the eurozone and the Schengen area.\n\nBut some of the policies from Brussels have outraged Slovaks, and Mr. Fico in particular.\n\nMr. Fico has said that his country will accept only Christian refugees, and that forcing a country with little history of Muslim immigration to take in Muslim refugees would amount to \u201cfalse solidarity.\u201d Slovakia is suing at the Court of Justice of the European Union to block a system devised by the European Commission that could require it to take a quota of migrants from the Middle East and Africa.\n\nMr. Juncker promised to cut down on red tape in Brussels, but said the European Union could not compromise on bedrock principles like freedom of movement.\n\n\u201cThere was one major issue, the freedom of movement of workers, and I will not change that because this is a basic freedom of the European Union,\u201d Mr. Juncker said.", "summary": "The view that power \u201cneeds to be rebalanced toward capitals is absolutely on the table in light of the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the bloc,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.
