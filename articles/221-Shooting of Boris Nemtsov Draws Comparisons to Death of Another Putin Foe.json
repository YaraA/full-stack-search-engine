But Mr. Litvinenko showed no sign of muscle weakness \u2014 a key indicator of thallium poisoning.\n\n\u201cI was becoming convinced that it was not thallium poisoning, but didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d said Dr. Amit Nathwani, a consultant at the University College Hospital in London where Mr. Litvinenko was transferred after initial treatment at Barnet in north London.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But it was only on the night before Mr. Litvinenko died, Dr. Nathwani said, that an expert from the facility called him and, for the first time, said polonium was a possibility.\n\nThe identification of the isotope was critical since it enabled the police to follow what became known as the \u201cpolonium trail,\u201d linking Mr. Litvinenko to two Russians accused of killing him, Andrei K. Lugovoi and Dmitri V. Kovtun, who both deny the charge. The British police say that Mr. Litvinenko was poisoned after drinking green tea laced with polonium at a bar in central London where he met Mr. Lugovoi, a former K.G.B. bodyguard, and Mr. Kovtun, a former Red Army soldier, on Nov. 1, 2006.\n\nThe delay in discovering polonium resulted from a feature of the isotope itself. Polonium emits mainly alpha radiation while the Geiger counter used to check Mr. Litvinenko for radiation poisoning detected gamma radiation.\n\nIndeed, a report at the Barnet hospital on Nov. 15, 2006, said there were \u201cno radioactive emissions\u201d from him. Dr. Andres Virchis, a consultant who treated Mr. Litvinenko at Barnet, told the inquiry on Monday that there was no equipment there to detect alpha radiation.\n\nAs physicians investigated the collapse of Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s bone marrow, Dr. Nathwani said, \u201cwe were fishing for diagnoses.\u201d But, he said, organ systems failed one after the other, because \u201cpolonium from the gut was being transferred to various parts of the body.\u201d\n\nAsked by a lawyer for the inquiry, Robin Tam, if it was true \u201cthat there wasn\u2019t in fact any treatment possible that could have saved\u201d Mr. Litvinenko, Dr. Nathwani replied: \u201cCorrect.\u201d"}
