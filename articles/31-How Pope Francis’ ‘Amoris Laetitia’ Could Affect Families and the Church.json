{"title": "How Pope Francis\u2019 \u2018Amoris Laetitia\u2019 Could Affect Families and the Church", "authors": ["Laurie Goodstein", "Jim Yardley"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/world/europe/pope-francis-amoris-laetitia-family.html", "body": "\u201cI\u2019m sure he knew he would touch some nerves,\u201d said John Thavis, a longtime Vatican analyst and the author of \u201cThe Vatican Diaries.\u201d \u201cHe may not have appreciated how much opposition there could be.\u201d\n\nBut both sides might be disappointed.\n\nSome who study Francis predict the apostolic exhortation will be a broad statement on universal problems affecting families, like poverty, migration, domestic violence, health care, youth unemployment and the neglect of children and the elderly. Francis\u2019 encyclical on the environment, \u201cLaudato Si\u2019,\u201d released in June, was an enormous study in connecting the dots, and experts are expecting a similar sweep in \u201cAmoris Laetitia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis document is meant for Catholics all over the world, some of whom are in desperate straits because of poverty and war and other crises that make having a family life almost impossible,\u201d said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a senior analyst for the American newspaper The National Catholic Reporter. \u201cThis pope, his heart aches for these people who are so marginalized. I\u2019m sure this document will address that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSo What\u2019s All the Fuss About?\n\nFrancis signaled early on that he wanted the church to re-examine its ministry to those who feel excluded, calling bishops to two synod meetings on the family, in 2014 and 2015. One of the major issues debated was the church policy that bars divorced Catholics who have remarried without seeking a church annulment of their first union from receiving the sacrament of holy communion, a centerpiece of Mass.\n\n(How strictly this ban is observed varies widely, depending on local priests and bishops; plenty of remarried Catholics receive holy communion regularly.)\n\nGetting an annulment requires appearances before a church tribunal and a fee, and it can take years. Francis streamlined the annulment process last year, but for many, it is still an insurmountable obstacle to full participation in the church. Some dioceses, especially in developing countries, do not have such tribunals, which require judges trained in the church\u2019s canon law.\n\nAt the synods, many bishops insisted that giving communion to divorced Catholics would undermine a core church doctrine that marriage is indissoluble. But other bishops were intent on finding a way to welcome back the divorced.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe second synod ended by essentially allowing both sides to declare victory. However, the dispute reverberated among Catholic intellectuals in the United States, with conservatives warning of an intrachurch civil war.\n\nNow, everyone is looking to Francis to settle the matter. But he may sidestep it, some experts said, by reaffirming church teaching that marriage is permanent, while encouraging flexibility in pastoral practice toward the remarried.\n\nA guide that the Vatican sent to Catholic bishops before the release of \u201cAmoris Laetitia\u201d offered only hints like this: \u201cThe pope\u2019s concern is therefore to re-contextualize doctrine at the service of the pastoral mission of the church.\u201d\n\nM. Cathleen Kaveny, a professor at Boston College who focuses on the relationship between law, religion and morality, said she was expecting \u201csome sort of movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is no shift at all, it would have been better had the whole discussion not been opened,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that people are looking to Francis to provide some way forward in these intractable personal situations.\u201d\n\nThe Last Word?\n\nThis type of document is a post-synodal apostolic exhortation. The first one to be issued in response to a synod of bishops was in 1967, by Pope Paul VI.\n\nApostolic exhortations are not as authoritative as papal encyclicals, and they do not normally change church doctrine. But there is doctrine, and there is practice, and the pope\u2019s instruction can influence how priests and bishops apply doctrine.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

The first, \u201cEvangelii Gaudium,\u201d or \u201cThe Joy of the Gospel,\u201d was released in 2013, Francis\u2019 first year as pope, and it is considered his manifesto. In it, he proclaims that the church must be open and humble to people\u2019s real needs, and not too rigidly fixed on doctrine. Many expect to see those themes echoed in the new document.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Francis Effect?\n\nFrancis is one of the world\u2019s most popular and influential figures, with a public persona that blends humility with boldness. From the first moments of his papacy, Francis challenged the Vatican hierarchy and took strong stances on issues such as capitalism, poverty, migration and climate change.\n\nBut Francis is also deeply pragmatic, particularly regarding internal church politics. Francis may want to be a bold reformer, but he knows the church can be pushed only so far, so quickly, especially given differing opinions among church leaders. He needs the world\u2019s bishops to be unified behind him if he wants changes to filter to the parish level.\n\nYet taking a middle-of-the-road approach is not without risks. Many Catholics eager for the church to change \u2014 and in a tangible way \u2014 look to him as their change agent. Doing too little may leave some supporters alienated, just as doing too much may anger conservative opponents. It is quite a balancing act.\n\nWhen Can We Read It?\n\nThe document will be published at noon on Friday in Rome, or 6 a.m. in New York. The New York Times will highlight excerpts."}
