Their assault began at 9:20 p.m. Friday, when one terrorist detonated a suicide bomb outside the gates of the soccer stadium on the northern outskirts of Paris. It ended at 12:20 a.m. Saturday when the authorities stormed a concert hall, the Bataclan. One attacker there was killed; two others detonated suicide vests. Inside the hall, 89 people, who had been listening to a rock band, had been shot to death.\n\nThe man with the Syrian passport \u2014 which Greek officials said had been registered at the Aegean island of Leros on Oct. 3 \u2014 was 25, and died at the stadium. Another assailant, who died at the concert hall, was 29 and a native of Courcouronnes, about 20 miles south of Paris. He had a criminal record and was known to be involved in extremist Islamic ideology, Mr. Molins said. Officials later identified him as Isma\u00ebl Omar Mostefa\u00ef and said they had detained several of his relatives for questioning.\n\nThe hunt for possible accomplices of the terrorists gained steam on Saturday. Officials in Belgium announced three arrests, one of them linked to a rental car found in Paris. In Germany, the police were exploring whether a man they arrested last week with weapons in his car and his GPS navigator set for Paris was linked to the attacks. But it remained unclear how a plot of such sophistication and lethality could have escaped the notice of intelligence agencies, both in France and abroad.\n\nMr. Hollande declared three days of national mourning, and said that military troops would patrol the capital. France remained under a nationwide state of emergency.\n\nMr. Hollande vowed to \u201cbe unforgiving with the barbarians from Daesh,\u201d adding that France would act within the law but with \u201call the necessary means, and on all terrains, inside and outside, in coordination with our allies, who are, themselves, targeted by this terrorist threat.\u201d\n\nThe attacks, and the possibility that the Islamic State was to blame, promised to further traumatize France and other European countries already fearful of violent jihadists radicalized by the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.\n\nThe possibility that one of the attackers was a migrant or had posed as one is sure to further complicate the already vexing problem for Europe of how to handle the unceasing flow of people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. It could also lend weight to the xenophobic arguments of right-wing populists like Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front party, who on Saturday held a news conference to declare that \u201cFrance and the French are no longer safe.\u201d\n\nMr. Hollande actively stepped up French participation in the military air campaign in Syria at the end of September. Just last week, France attacked oil operations under the Islamic State\u2019s control in Syria. On Oct. 8, it conducted a targeted strike against militants in Raqqa, Syria, apparently against Salim Benghalem, a Frenchman fighting for the Islamic State.\n\nThe attacks, and the threat of the Islamic State, are likely to dominate a summit meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 nations that starts on Sunday in Turkey. President Obama will attend; Mr. Hollande is staying in Paris and sending representatives.\n\nVideo\n\nParis, stricken by shock and grief, remained in a state of lockdown, with public transportation hobbled and public institutions \u2014 schools, museums, libraries, pools, food markets \u2014 closed. Charles de Gaulle Airport remained open, but with significant delays because of tighter passport and baggage checks.\n\nThe archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, said he would celebrate a Mass at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame on Sunday for the victims, their families and France. \u201cOur country has once again known pain and mourning and must stand up to the barbarism propagated by fanatical groups,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou in west Paris, about 40 people were in surgery as of the early afternoon. Julien Ribes, 33, was at the hospital to search for his friend, who was at the concert hall. \u201cI\u2019m in total shock,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the Town Hall for the 11th Arrondissement in Paris, Delphine de Peretti, 35, said she had learned early Saturday afternoon that her sister Aur\u00e9lie, who was at the Bataclan music hall, had been killed. The family had been desperately trying to reach Aur\u00e9lie all night.\n\n\u201cThey told us my sister was dead, but they did not let us see her,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said they still have to do some medical analysis. I am like a robot. I don\u2019t know what to do next. I have not watched the news or slept since last night.\u201d\n\nThe death toll far surpassed that of a massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and related attacks by Islamic extremists around the French capital in January. Friday\u2019s attacks were the deadliest in Western Europe since the 2004 train bombings in Madrid, which killed 191 people. And it prompted Mr. Hollande to pronounce a state of emergency, the first time in France since 2005, when riots rocked downtrodden urban areas across the country.\n\nVideo\n\nParisians were left struggling to make sense of their new reality. Parents whose children slept through the ordeal were facing the difficult task of trying to explain what had happened, and why so many planned activities had been canceled and public spaces were closed.\n\nOn the Champ de Mars, at the base of the Eiffel Tower and along the pedestrian promenade that hugs the Left Bank of the Seine, joggers and cyclists tried to carry on with their Saturday routines.\n\nPausing from her morning run near the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Marie-Caroline de Richemont, 32, said she was still trying to process the events, but without succumbing to fear. \u201cThis is not Iraq or Afghanistan,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not at war here. We need to stay confident and hopeful.\u201d\n\nBertrand Bourgeois, 42, an accountant, was lost in thought as he cast a fishing line beneath the Invalides bridge.\n\nHe normally avoids fishing in Paris, he said, preferring quieter sections of the Seine near his home in Poissy, a northwest suburb. But after the violence, he said he felt drawn to come into the city out of a sense of solidarity.\n\nAlthough his wife asked him to stay home, \u201csomething in me felt like it was important to be here, to say \u2018still alive,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Bourgeois said.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cI feel sickened, angry,\u201d he said. Coming so soon after the attacks in January, he said, \u201cIt is starting to be too much.\u201d\n\nOn the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, rows of Christmas market stalls stood shuttered. Several vendors stood idly, awaiting word about whether they would be allowed to open for business, while clutches of heavily armed police officers patrolled the largely empty sidewalks of one of Europe\u2019s most famed avenues.\n\nAt Charles de Gaulle Airport, it took two and a half hours for some passengers arriving Saturday morning to reach passport control. Some passengers who had arrived on overnight flights learned what had happened only when they switched on their devices; many read the news in a state of stunned silence.\n\nPope Francis joined a chorus of world leaders \u2014 including the heads of government of Belgium, Burundi, Canada, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Spain and the United States \u2014 who have condemned the attacks.\n\n\u201cThere is no justification for such things, neither religious nor human, this is not human,\u201d Francis said in a telephone call to TV2000, the television station of the Italian Episcopal Conference. \u201cIt is difficult to understand such things, done by human beings,\u201d he added, clearly moved. Francis said he was praying for the families of the victims, for France \u201cand for all those who suffer.\u201d\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany gave an emotional national address on Saturday pledging solidarity with the French government and people, and calling on Europeans to stand together in defiance of an attack on the liberties the Continent represents.\n\n\u201cWe, your German friends, we are so close with you,\u201d said Ms. Merkel, dressed in black. \u201cWe are crying with you. Together with you, we will fight against those who have carried out such an unfathomable act against you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who we mourn were murdered in front of cafes, in restaurants, in a concert hall or on the open street. They wanted to live the life of free people in a city that celebrates life,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cAnd they met with murderers who hate this life of freedom.\u201d\n\nThe French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, meeting on Saturday in Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry and other top diplomats to discuss the continuing crisis in Syria, said the attacks highlighted the urgency of the talks. \u201cIt is more necessary than ever in the current circumstance to coordinate the international fight against terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the United States, there was no sign of a direct threat to American cities, but the F.B.I. was reviewing cases involving the Islamic State as a precaution. The F.B.I. will send a team of agents to Paris to assist with the investigation, law enforcement officials said.\n\nThe F.B.I. is already heavily focused on the threat from Americans inspired by the militant group. The government had so many people under surveillance in those cases that, this spring, officials pulled agents off other cases to help monitor them.", "summary": "It could also lend weight to the xenophobic arguments of right-wing populists like Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front party, who on Saturday held a news conference to declare that \u201cFrance and the French are no longer safe.\u201d Several vendors stood idly, awaiting word about whether they would be allowed to open for business, while clutches of heavily armed police officers patrolled the largely empty sidewalks of one of Europe\u2019s most famed avenues.
