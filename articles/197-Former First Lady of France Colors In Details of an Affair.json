She acknowledges that she \u201ccracked\u201d and attempted suicide by trying to overdose on sleeping pills when she learned of Mr. Hollande\u2019s affair with an actress, Julie Gayet.\n\nWhile the book, \u201cThank You for This Moment,\u201d in many ways merely confirms the outlines of an episode much speculated about in the French news media, it is the first time that a sitting French president has been the object of a \u201ckiss and tell\u201d book. Its lurid details, and sometimes belittling tone toward Mr. Hollande, have provoked both sensation and some criticism here after excerpts were published by the magazine Paris Match before the book\u2019s official release on Thursday.\n\nMany commentators described it as an act of revenge from a humiliated woman that would further tarnish the image of Mr. Hollande, whose popularity is already at record lows. A spokesman for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said he did not wish to comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter learning of the affair, Ms. Trierweiler, a longtime journalist for Paris Match, had an \u201cemotional collapse,\u201d according to her spokesman at the time, and spent more than a week in a hospital."}
