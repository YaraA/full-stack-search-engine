{"title": "After Defeat, Britain\u2019s Labour Party Argues Over Its New Leader", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/24/world/europe/britain-labour-leader.html", "body": "Outside the party, Mr. Corbyn is considered unelectable, and hence a great gift to the Conservative Party, and when the Labour Party finally decides, in September, that may emerge as the prevailing wisdom. But his rise \u2014 with some polls of party members showing him leading \u2014 has served only to emphasize the depth of Labour\u2019s confusion about its future.\n\nAs telling, perhaps, Liz Kendall, 44, the only one of four candidates considered close to the policies of Tony Blair \u2014 who led centrist \u201cNew Labour\u201d to three general election victories \u2014 is running a poor last. On Thursday, she angrily rejected pressure to quit the race to forestall the rise of Mr. Corbyn.\n\nEd Miliband, the former Labour leader, resigned immediately after this year\u2019s defeat, and the party that once praised him now blames him for all its troubles.\n\nNo fan of Mr. Blair, Mr. Miliband pushed the party to the left, but voters rejected him. Labour won more votes in England than in 2010, but it was slaughtered in Scotland, losing all but one seat there and 26 seats over all.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe other two contenders, who are more conventional, are Andy Burnham, 45, born in Liverpool, who was the party\u2019s designated, or \u201cshadow,\u201d health secretary, and Yvette Cooper, 46, the shadow home secretary and former shadow foreign secretary. Ms. Cooper is married to Ed Balls, who was shadow chancellor but lost his seat in May, marking the depth of Labour\u2019s troubles. Mr. Balls is keeping out of the way while Ms. Cooper tries to become Labour\u2019s first female leader.\n\nMr. Blair, who is widely disliked in the Labour Party for having led the country to war in Iraq on erroneous claims about Iraqi unconventional weapons, was no fan of Mr. Miliband. The prospect of Mr. Corbyn, who is even farther to the left, prompted another Blair intervention on Wednesday, a warning that \u201can old-fashioned leftist platform\u201d would mean Conservative rule for the next 15 years.\n\n\u201cWhen people say, \u2018My heart says I should be with that politics,\u2019 well, get a transplant, because that\u2019s just daft,\u201d Mr. Blair said. \u201cYou win from the center, you win when you support business as well as unions. You don\u2019t win from a traditional leftist position.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Mr. Corbyn is clear about what he wants \u2014 an end to austerity, a big tax-and-spend state. But Mr. Burnham and Ms. Cooper are trying to thread the needle between an appeal to Labour members, who think Mr. Miliband was not sufficiently left-wing, and the larger public, including Liberal Democrat voters and centrist Conservatives, who want a society with more social justice but one that also lives within its means and rewards success.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ms. Cooper, who worries the Conservatives the most, floundered under tough questioning about her policy positions, causing a BBC interviewer to say that she was good at the rhetoric of unity but that she was reluctant to take firm positions, leaving many unclear as to what she actually stood for.\n\nBoth Ms. Cooper and Ms. Kendall have said that if Mr. Corbyn is elected leader, they will not take positions in his shadow cabinet.\n\nMr. Burnham, who is considered politically between Mr. Corbyn and Ms. Cooper, was damaged when Unite failed to support him this month and when he was thought to have flip-flopped over whether Labour should support the government\u2019s plans for billions in welfare cuts.\n\nJohn McTernan, a former Blair aide, branded as \u201cmorons\u201d Labour legislators who nominated Mr. Corbyn to join the race but did not support him. One of them, Margaret Beckett, the party\u2019s former deputy leader, admitted that she regretted her decision to nominate Mr. Corbyn. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to wish that I hadn\u2019t, I\u2019ll be quite honest about it,\u201d she told the BBC. Asked if she was a \u201cmoron\u201d for having done so, she said, \u201cYes, I am one of them.\u201d\n\nTrying to explain why Mr. Corbyn was performing so well with Labour Party members, Mr. McTernan said, \u201cPolitical parties are full of suicidally inclined activists and clearly some Labour members are suicidally inclined.\u201d\n\nMr. Blair called Mr. Corbyn \u201cthe Tory preference,\u201d and in fact some Conservatives are being urged by The Telegraph, a right-wing daily newspaper, to sign up as Labour Party supporters in order to vote for Mr. Corbyn in the leadership contest. The winner will emerge only in mid-September, giving the Labour Party two more months to sort it all out.", "summary": "As telling, perhaps, Liz Kendall, 44, the only one of four candidates considered close to the policies of Tony Blair \u2014 who led centrist \u201cNew Labour\u201d to three general election victories \u2014 is running a poor last.
