On Wednesday, after his final prime minister\u2019s questions in Parliament, he will visit Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation. Shortly after, Ms. May will be granted an audience with the queen and invited to form a government. She and her husband, Philip, will most likely pose for a photo in front of 10 Downing Street with Mr. Cameron and his family, as their predecessors have done.\n\nLarry the Cat will be staying, the government spokesman said wryly, adding that Ms. May would inherit the tabby, adopted from an animal shelter in 2011 to help address a rat problem.\n\nMr. Cameron made his resignation announcement on June 24, one day after the referendum to withdraw from the European Union, a decision commonly known as Brexit. On Monday, after he announced the timetable of his departure and expressed his support for Ms. May, he was recorded jovially humming as he re-entered 10 Downing Street, seemingly relieved.\n\nBut the rapid departure poses logistical challenges for Mr. Cameron and his wife, Samantha, including the question of where to live.\n\nThe Camerons have three children \u2014 their youngest, Florence, is 5 \u2014 and hope to stay in the capital. But their home in the North Kensington area of west London has been rented out, and their farmhouse in the hamlet of Dean, Oxfordshire, about 73 miles northwest of London, is probably too far for daily commuting.\n\nVideo\n\nThe arrival of the moving van at the rear entrance on Downing Street suggested that the Camerons have at least found temporary lodgings, although officials would not confirm this.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe movers arrived with 330 boxes, 30 rolls of tape and three rolls of Bubble Wrap. Simply Removals, the company that handled the Camerons\u2019 move into Downing Street in 2010, and calls itself \u201cLondon\u2019s affordable removal firm,\u201d advertises a \u201cBig One\u201d package that includes 25 standard boxes, two large boxes, two wardrobe boxes, Bubble Wrap, packing paper and tape, for 169 pounds, or about $224. A recording on the company\u2019s office phone extolled its qualifications, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why we were Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s choice when he first moved into No. 10.\u201d\n\nThe house at 10 Downing Street has been the official residence of the prime minister since 1735, but the Cameron family actually lives in more spacious quarters at 11 Downing Street. That house is the official residence of the chancellor of the Exchequer, Britain\u2019s finance minister. (In 2010, the chancellor, George Osborne, chose to remain at his residence in the Notting Hill section of west London.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The party has been known for disposing of its leaders with ruthless efficiency, notably in 1990 when Mrs. Thatcher was effectively ousted in a party coup.\n\n\u201cHe is practically being thrown out of his house, though I dare say he will have some people to help him pack his bags,\u201d Mr. York said in a phone interview. Comparing the Conservative establishment to an elite boarding school like Eton, which Mr. Cameron attended, Mr. York added: \u201cThey are saying: \u2018You are no longer the head boy. Get out of the house. It\u2019s for the good of the school.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. York predicted that Ms. May, the daughter of a vicar, would bring a change in the atmospherics at 10 Downing Street, including, he said, replacing the \u201csocially smart, upper-middle-class\u201d social circles of the Camerons \u2014 the \u201cNotting Hill set,\u201d as observers often call it \u2014 with a no-nonsense middle England sensibility.\n\n\u201cTheresa will make No. 10 more mainstream bourgeois, and redo the place for the post-Brexit era,\u201d Mr. York predicted. \u201cI imagine lots of floral sofas.\u201d", "summary": "On Wednesday, after his final prime minister\u2019s questions in Parliament, he will visit Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation.
