{"title": "Scotland Rejects Independence From United Kingdom", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger", "Alan Cowell"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/world/europe/scotland-independence-vote.html", "body": "The outcome was a deep disappointment to the vocal, enthusiastic pro-independence movement led by the Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, who had seen an opportunity to turn a centuries-old nationalist dream into reality, and forced the three main British parties into panicked promises to grant substantial new power to the Scottish Parliament.\n\nSlide Show\n\nThe decision spared Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain a shattering defeat that would have raised questions about his ability to continue in office and diminished his nation\u2019s standing in the world.\n\nBut while the result preserved a union molded in 1707, it left Mr. Cameron facing a backlash among some of his Conservative Party lawmakers. They were angered by the promises of greater Scottish autonomy that he and other party leaders made just days before the vote, when it appeared that the independence campaign might win. Some lawmakers called for similar autonomy for England itself, and even the creation of a separate English Parliament.\n\nThe outcome headed off the huge economic, political and military imponderables that would have flowed from a vote for independence.

Indeed, Britain had long prided itself on a so-called special relationship with the United States, and Britain\u2019s allies had been concerned by, among other things, Mr. Salmond\u2019s vow to evict Britain\u2019s nuclear submarine bases from Scotland, threatening London\u2019s role in Western defenses.\n\nAs the vote approached, the margin between the two camps narrowed to a few percentage points, and at one point, the \u201cyes\u201d campaign seemed to have the momentum.\n\nThat was enough to alarm Britain\u2019s political leaders from the three main parties in the Westminster Parliament in London. In a rare show of unity, they promised to extend significant new powers of taxation to Scotland, while maintaining a formula for public spending that many English voters saw as favoring Scots with a higher per-capita contribution.\n\nVoters remained divided to the very end.", "summary": "The decision spared Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain a shattering defeat that would have raised questions about his ability to continue in office and diminished his nation\u2019s standing in the world.They were angered by the promises of greater Scottish autonomy that he and other party leaders made just days before the vote, when it appeared that the independence campaign might win.Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.The passion of the campaign also left Scots divided, and Mr. Salmond was expected to call later on Friday for reconciliation after a vibrant exercise in democracy that had episodes of harshness and even intimidation.In a rare show of unity, they promised to extend significant new powers of taxation to Scotland, while maintaining a formula for public spending that many English voters saw as favoring Scots with a higher per-capita contribution."}
