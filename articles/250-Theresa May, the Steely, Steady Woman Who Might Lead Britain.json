{"title": "Theresa May, the Steely, Steady Woman Who Might Lead Britain", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/world/europe/theresa-may.html", "body": "\u201cI know I\u2019m not a showy politician,\u201d Ms. May said on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t tour the television studios. I don\u2019t gossip about people over lunch. I don\u2019t go drinking in Parliament\u2019s bars.\u201d\n\nOne former colleague in Parliament, Tim Yeo, recalled that Ms. May would attend his parties, but that she was not the type \u201cto attract a circle of people around her roaring with laughter.\u201d That may be just right for the times, he said, because \u201cher caution will stand her in good stead when there is chaos all around.\u201d\n\nAnother colleague, Ken Clarke, said Tuesday in an unguarded moment captured on camera that \u201cTheresa is a bloody difficult woman,\u201d noting that he had worked with another woman with a steely reputation who also confronted male-dominated politics: Margaret Thatcher.\n\nVideo\n\nMs. May\u2019s tenacity has drawn parallels not only to Ms. Thatcher but also to another methodical woman in politics, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, a clergyman\u2019s daughter, like Ms. May.\n\nBorn in 1956, Ms. May grew up mainly in Oxfordshire, an only child who was first drawn to the Conservative Party at age 12. A conscientious student (a goody two-shoes, she once told The Daily Telegraph), she never rebelled against her religious upbringing and remains a regular churchgoer. Tellingly, her sports hero was Geoffrey Boycott, a solid, stubborn cricketer who specialized in playing the long game.\n\nLike Mr. Cameron and Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who recently dropped out of the Conservative leadership race, she won a place at Oxford (though some years before them). But while they got there by way of Eton College and joined Oxford\u2019s hedonistic Bullingdon Club, she attended a state secondary school and had a more sedate university career.\n\nPolitics was important to her, and she attended the famous Oxford Union debating society and joined the university\u2019s Conservative Association. At one of the association\u2019s gatherings, a fellow student \u2014 Benazir Bhutto, the future prime minister of Pakistan \u2014 introduced her to the man she would marry, Philip May.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. May has described her husband, who went on to become an investment banker, as her rock. The couple has no children. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t happen,\u201d she told The Daily Telegraph. \u201cYou look at families all the time, and you see there is something there that you don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nMs. May worked in financial services, including for a time at the Bank of England, while pursuing her political ambitions. She won a seat in Parliament in 1997, representing Maidenhead, a prosperous town west of London, just as her party was entering a long spell out of power. She rose quickly through the Conservative ranks and gained national attention with a jolting speech at an annual party convention, an occasion usually used to flatter party activists.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Instead, he became deputy prime minister without a departmental brief, setting Ms. May on her way.\n\nAt the Home Office, she resisted pressure from the American government to extradite Gary McKinnon, a Briton accused of computer hacking, citing human rights concerns. But she negotiated a treaty with Jordan that allowed Britain to extradite Abu Qatada, a radical Islamic preacher. His extradition had been obstructed by the European Court of Human Rights, which feared he might face torture in Jordan.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. May also won respect by confronting a powerful interest group, the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. In a speech to the group in 2014, she listed a series of police failings, demanded change and was greeted with stony silence.\n\nAccording to Norman Baker, a Liberal Democrat who served under her in the Home Office during the coalition government, Ms. May is politically \u201cnot very liberal\u201d and personally \u201chard as nails,\u201d with a willingness to stand up even to the prime minister on policy issues. \u201cYou don\u2019t survive as home secretary for six years without some form of aptitude,\u201d Mr. Baker said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound too positive, because I wouldn\u2019t want her as prime minister,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I would rather have her than the rest of those that are standing, because at least she is competent.\u201d\n\nHer political Achilles\u2019 heel is immigration, which is part of her responsibility as home secretary. Mr. Cameron promised to reduce net migration into Britain to fewer than 100,000 people a year, but the target has repeatedly been missed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. May could not curb arrivals from inside the European Union, who are legally entitled to settle in Britain. But arrivals from outside the bloc, which the government can control, have also remained stubbornly high. Over all, the net figure for 2015 was more than 330,000.\n\nMs. May is regarded as being more right wing than Mr. Cameron, though she supported his legalization of same-sex marriage. When the European Union referendum was called, it was touch-and-go whether she would campaign for or against membership.\n\nIn the end, she supported Mr. Cameron\u2019s bid to stay in the bloc, but she kept very quiet. That allows her to present herself as a unity candidate to a parliamentary party that was deeply split by the issue.\n\nHowever, it also means that any deal she could negotiate with the European Union over Britain\u2019s future ties to the bloc would face close scrutiny from the union\u2019s more ideological critics. That would leave her limited room to maneuver on the central issue, Britain\u2019s access to the European Union\u2019s single market of goods and services. Such access normally entails accepting free movement of workers, but that is anathema to those who want to reduce immigration.\n\nMs. May sought to reassure hard-liners last week by promising there would be no attempt to remain inside the European Union or to rejoin it through the back door.\n\n\u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d she said firmly, suggesting that if it falls to her to negotiate a British withdrawal from the European Union, she will, as ever, just get on and deal with it.", "summary": "One former colleague in Parliament, Tim Yeo, recalled that Ms. May would attend his parties, but that she was not the type \u201cto attract a circle of people around her roaring with laughter.\u201d That may be just right for the times, he said, because \u201cher caution will stand her in good stead when there is chaos all around.\u201d Like Mr. Cameron and Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who recently dropped out of the Conservative leadership race, she won a place at Oxford (though some years before them).
