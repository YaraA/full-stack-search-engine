Even with a passport,\u201d said Moayad Alzreak, head of the media office for the Syrian side of the Cilvegozu border crossing. \u201cThe Turkish Army has cracked down on smuggling routes as well, so it is hard to get to the Turkish side.\u201d\n\nA Turkish official at the Hatay governor\u2019s office, who did not give his name because he was not permitted to speak on the matter, said that wounded Syrians were being allowed into Turkey. But Syrian aid workers complain that Syrians seeking urgent treatment for illnesses like cancer cannot get through for treatment, even with a doctor\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cTen people have died since the closure,\u201d said Ahmad Akrama, a member of Jaish al-Islam, a rebel group fighting the Assad government. \u201cI witnessed the death of an 11-year-old kid, who needed to be hospitalized in the emergency ward for kidney problems but died at the border.\u201d\n\nAn average of 3,000 Syrians used to cross into Turkey through the Cilvegozu border gate on a daily basis, and at least 1,000 would get through on crowded days, according to Mr. Alzreak. But now, refugees who want to flee to Turkey are left with no option but to cross illegally with human smugglers, whose main routes were recently cut off by the Turkish military.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNow we are all stuck,\u201d said Mr. Falouti, who used to cross from Turkey into Syria frequently for business. \u201cSometimes I ask myself if it is possible that I will never see Syria again.\u201d", "summary": "Although Turkey has recently taken steps to stem the flow of foreign jihadists through its porous 560-mile border with Syria, its efforts have fallen short of expectations from the international community, which has criticized the government for having other priorities that limit its role in the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State.
