But Mr. Corbyn insists that he has the support of party members, has brought more people into politics and will fight in the next election, which is scheduled for 2020.\n\nAnnouncing her decision to withdraw from the leadership contest, Ms. Eagle, a former spokeswoman on business issues, said she would support Mr. Smith, adding in a Twitter post that he \u201cwill make a great leader for Labour\u201d and a \u201cgreat\u201d prime minister.\n\n\u201cHe has the values, vision and policies we need to take on the Tories,\u201d she said, referring to the Conservative Party, and adding that Labour needs \u201cnew leadership if we are to make a difference for our country and build a fairer, more equal society.\u201d\n\nMs. Eagle, who set off the Labour leadership contest, was the front-runner, while Mr. Smith had been a relatively low-profile figure within the party until recently. However, he outflanked Ms. Eagle with strong media performances and by pitching his campaign to the left of hers, as well as by highlighting his opposition to the Iraq war, for which she voted.\n\nIraq remains a touchstone issue among Labour members who will decide the leadership contest. Mr. Smith, a former journalist, entered Parliament only in 2010, and is not tainted by association with the governments of the former leader Tony Blair \u2014 who is unpopular among Labour activists.\n\nWithin the party, tensions are high and party meetings have been suspended after allegations that lawmakers had been threatened or intimidated. In one incident, a brick was thrown through the window of Ms. Eagle\u2019s constituency office.", "summary": "A majority of current Labour lawmakers never wanted Mr. Corbyn as their leader, see him as an electoral liability and blame him for the party\u2019s lackluster campaign to keep Britain in the European Union ahead of last month\u2019s referendum, in which Britons voted to leave.
