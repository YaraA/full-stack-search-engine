But that did nothing to quiet demands for a fuller explanation.\n\n\u201cMr. Rajoy will now have to give some kind of clearer explanation,\u201d said Gaspar Ari\u00f1o Ortiz, a lawyer in Madrid and former member of Parliament from the Popular Party.\n\nIn the context of a recession and record unemployment, Mr. Ari\u00f1o Ortiz said, \u201ccitizens who are struggling to make ends meet are seeing that huge amounts of money have been handled within a Spanish party funding system that is completely obscure, anonymous and open to corruption.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He has denied wrongdoing, and through his lawyer, he denied ever keeping a parallel and undeclared set of books in order to make payments to politicians.\n\nWhen he resigned, Mr. B\u00e1rcenas took nine boxes of documents with him from his offices, a trove that stands as an implicit threat to party officials, commentators say, that if he is taken down in the scandals, he plans to take others with him. The recent disclosure that Mr. B\u00e1rcenas kept vast sums of money in Switzerland is just one of about 300 corruption investigations being conducted in Spain, many linked to questionable deals made among bankers, developers and politicians during the nation\u2019s decade-long property boom. Few have been convicted so far.\n\nThe corruption investigations have also tainted Spain\u2019s institutional fabric, from the monarchy to the Supreme Court, whose chief justice was forced to resign last year over questionable business expense claims. On Wednesday, a judge demanded that I\u00f1aki Urdangarin, the son-in-law of King Juan Carlos, and his former business partner post bond of $11 million as the judiciary deepens its investigation into the possible embezzlement of millions in public money allocated to sports and tourism events.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Urdangarin has not been formally charged, but last year he became the first member of the royal family to appear in court in modern Spanish history.\n\nThe report in El Pa\u00eds added to the disillusionment of many Spaniards, including some longstanding supporters of the Popular Party. One was Julian Acevedo Ruiz, a grocery store owner who said he had always voted for the party, including Mr. Rajoy in 2011.\n\n\u201cI wish that I had never voted,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause really none of our politicians are worthy of the trust that we placed in them.\u201d"}
