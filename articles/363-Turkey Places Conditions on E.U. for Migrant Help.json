He said the European Union had been slow to disburse the 3 billion euros (about $3.3 billion) it had already pledged to assist refugees in Turkey. \u201cThe prime minister is in Brussels right now,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said of Mr. Davutoglu. \u201cI hope he returns with that money.\u201d\n\nOpen Borders in Crisis In response to the flow of migrants, European countries have suspended the rules of the Schengen accord allowing the free movement of citizens across most of Europe\u2019s internal borders. (Source: European Commission)\n\nThe additional money, amounting to about \u20ac3 billion, that Turkey requested on Monday was a precondition for curbing new migrants from crossing the Aegean Sea to reach Europe.\n\nMr. Davutoglu also surprised European leaders in a negotiating session that dragged into Monday morning by putting Turkey\u2019s attempts to join the European Union \u2014 a process known as accession \u2014 on the agenda.\n\n\u201cTurkey is ready to work with the E.U.,\u201d Mr. Davutoglu said Monday. \u201cTurkey is ready to be a member of the E.U. as well.\u201d He added, \u201cI hope this summit, which will not focus only on irregular migration but also on the Turkish accession process to the E.U., will be a success story and a turning point in our relations.\u201d\n\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents the leaders of the 28-nation European Union, included language about closing the Balkan route in a draft of a summit meeting statement, reinforcing his blunt warning last week to migrants who are seeking a better life in Europe but are not eligible for political asylum.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Merkel resisted the wording of Mr. Tusk\u2019s statement about closing the Balkan route.\n\nGermany also has been sharply at odds with a neighbor, Austria, after the government in Vienna restricted the flow of migrants, threatening the bloc\u2019s system of passport-free travel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOthers would like to see European borders stay shut.\n\n\u201cIf we bring migrants from Greece or Turkey directly into Europe, that\u2019s an invitation to waltz,\u201d Hungary\u2019s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban, told reporters here. He added, \u201cBorders must be closed, and direct resettlement is out of the question, at least as far as Hungary is concerned.\u201d\n\nThe record flow of more than one million migrants to the Continent last year exposed the inadequacy of the European Union\u2019s response to the geopolitical and humanitarian crisis caused by Syria\u2019s civil war. More than 140,000 people have arrived in the European Union by sea so far this year.\n\nNow much of the attention is on how to stop migrants from reaching Europe in the first place \u2014 and to distinguish Syrians and Iraqis, whose claims to asylum are generally viewed sympathetically, from those who are fleeing poverty and chaos elsewhere.\n\nFor many years, Turkey has ostensibly been a candidate for European Union membership, but Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian turn has made that seem like an ever more distant prospect.\n\nHuman rights observers reacted angrily to a comment over the weekend in which the German interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, said, \u201cWe should not be referees when it comes to human rights.\u201d", "summary": "Hoping to avoid a repeat of last year, when hundreds of thousands of refugees overwhelmed the authorities from Greece to Germany and beyond, European leaders were weighing whether to declare \u201cclosed\u201d the route migrants have taken through the Balkans to Western Europe. \u201cYou end up in situations like this when you have neglected to build the capacity to deal with the bigger issues of our time,\u201d said Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research group in Brussels.
