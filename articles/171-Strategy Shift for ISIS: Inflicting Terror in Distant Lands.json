American and British Special Operations forces have for months been conducting secret surveillance missions in Libya to monitor the rise of fighters aligned with the Islamic State.\n\nThe massacre in Paris on Friday, following bombings in Beirut, Lebanon, and the downing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt, all claimed by the Islamic State, reveals a terrorist organization that has changed in significant ways from the West\u2019s initial understanding of it as a group focused on holding territory in Syria and Iraq and building a caliphate, or Islamic state.\n\nAnd actions by the United States and its allies \u2014 including a Western bombing campaign of Islamic State-held fighting positions and oil facilities, coordinated with a ground offensive by Kurdish forces to cut off a major supply line \u2014 foreshadow how the West might respond to the growing menace in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, has for the first time engaged in what appears to be a centrally planned campaign of terrorist attacks aimed at inflicting huge civilian casualties on distant territory, forcing many counterterrorism officials in the United States and in Europe to recalibrate their assessment of the group.\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\u201cThey have crossed some kind of Rubicon,\u201d said William McCants, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and author of \u201cThe ISIS Apocalypse.\u201d \u201cThey have definitely shifted in their thinking about targeting their enemies.\u201d\n\nWhen the Islamic State\u2019s Egyptian arm claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian charter plane over Sinai two weeks ago, some analysts wondered if the group\u2019s so-called Sinai Province of the Islamic State had acted on its own and leapt out in front, even at the cost of risking a Russian military backlash on the parent group in Syria and Iraq.\n\nBut the attacks last week in Paris and Beirut, which the Islamic State also said it carried out, appear to have settled that question and convinced even skeptics that the central leadership was calling the shots.\n\n\u201cThere is a radical change of perception by the terrorists that they can now act in Paris just as they act in Syria or Baghdad,\u201d said Mathieu Guid\u00e8re, a terrorism specialist at the University of Toulouse. \u201cWith this action, a psychological barrier has been broken.\u201d\n\nIndeed, at a time when many Western officials were most concerned about Islamic State-inspired, lone-wolf attacks \u2014 terrifying in their randomness but relatively low in casualties \u2014 the attacks in Paris have revived the specter of coordinated, high-casualty attacks planned with the involvement of a relatively large number of perpetrators.\n\nAmerican and European authorities said the Paris assault bore the hallmarks of complex attacks conducted by Al Qaeda, or of the Mumbai plot in 2008, when 10 Islamic militants carried out a series of 12 shootings and bombings in the Indian city, lasting four days and killing 164 people.\n\n\u201cTheir goal is an unconventional urban guerrilla war,\u201d said Franck Chaix, an officer of the Gendarmerie, France\u2019s semi-military police force, and a former head of its special intervention force, G.I.G.N.\n\nAl Qaeda, the Islamic State\u2019s principal forebear, built its identity around spectacular terrorist attacks because its leaders saw themselves as insurgents seeking to overturn Arab governments that they deemed apostates. Al Qaeda wanted to bait the West into military actions that would destabilize Arab states. The Islamic State, in contrast, has increasingly styled itself a state and, in many ways, behaved like one.\n\nThe ideology and motivation behind the change may be opaque for years. Analysts suggest that the messianic and apocalyptic side of its jihadist ideology may have gotten the better of the pragmatic impulse that had previously appeared to guide the group\u2019s expansion. Or, experts say, the Islamic State may be seeking to use large terrorist attacks the way a more conventional power might use an air force as a tool of its defense policy, to retaliate against enemy attacks and seek to deter them.\n\nBut, if so, its tactics may be shortsighted, causing redoubled Western attempts to crush the militant organization \u2014 even as the spreading Islamic State structure makes those efforts more challenging.\n\nThe attacks come against a backdrop of signs that the Islamic State\u2019s leaders based in Raqqa, Syria, may have been building closer cooperation with its two most significant affiliates, or \u201cprovinces,\u201d in Libya and Egypt.\n\nThe main Libyan arm of the Islamic State \u2014 known as the Tripoli Province and centered in the midcoastal city of Sirte \u2014 has long demonstrated the closest coordination with the group\u2019s Syrian hub. The two operations began advertising their cooperation as early as February with a video of Islamic State fighters beheading at least a dozen Egyptian Christians.\n\nWestern intelligence agencies say Islamic State fighters with experience in Syria and Iraq have often turned up in Darnah, a militant stronghold east of Sirte, although the group\u2019s affiliate there was routed earlier this year in a dispute with militant rivals.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The airstrike took place in Darnah shortly after the attacks in Paris began, but had been in the works for several days and was not related to the events in France, American officials said.\n\nThe strike was aimed at Abu Nabil, also known as Wissam Najm Abd Zayd al Zubaydi. He is an Iraqi national who led Qaeda operations in western Iraq from 2004 until 2010. He later moved to eastern Libya to lead Islamic State operations there, the officials said.\n\nPentagon officials said they believed the strike, first reported by The Daily Beast, had killed Abu Nabil, though it would take a few days to confirm. It marked the first time the United States has targeted a senior Islamic State operative outside Iraq or Syria.\n\nLibyan news media reported last week that a senior Islamic State leader had personally visited Sirte, stirring speculation about the main group\u2019s plans for its local branch. The leader, known as Abu Ali al-Anbari, arrived \u201cby the sea,\u201d the Libyan news network 218TV reported, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group.\n\nMr. Anbari\u2019s arrival may represent what a senior Pentagon official said were signs that Libya could provide a redoubt for the Islamic State even if the group was driven completely out of Syria and Iraq.\n\nWith no functioning government, Libya provides a variety of havens and hiding places for Islamic State militants, so airstrikes or other military action on Sirte would merely push them elsewhere. And unlike Syria and Iraq, Libya is a failed state surrounded by weak ones.\n\nThe timing of the explosion aboard the Russian charter jet with the Islamic State attacks in Beirut and Paris is the most visible indication yet that the Sinai Province group may be taking directions from the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. If the attacks in all three countries were coordinated, some central planners must have been involved.\n\nThe plane crash was also at least the second time that the Sinai Province has cited retribution for the Western campaign against the faraway Islamic State \u2014 and not domestic Egyptian governance \u2014 as a motive for its acts. It cited the same reasoning this August when it released a video in the Islamic State\u2019s trademark style showing the beheading of a Croatian working for a French energy company.", "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Defying Western efforts to confront the Islamic State on the battlefield, the group has evolved in its reach and organizational ability, with increasingly dangerous hubs outside Iraq and Syria and strategies that call for using spectacular acts of violence against civilians.And actions by the United States and its allies \u2014 including a Western bombing campaign of Islamic State-held fighting positions and oil facilities, coordinated with a ground offensive by Kurdish forces to cut off a major supply line \u2014 foreshadow how the West might respond to the growing menace in the coming weeks.American and European authorities said the Paris assault bore the hallmarks of complex attacks conducted by Al Qaeda, or of the Mumbai plot in 2008, when 10 Islamic militants carried out a series of 12 shootings and bombings in the Indian city, lasting four days and killing 164 people.Al Qaeda, the Islamic State\u2019s principal forebear, built its identity around spectacular terrorist attacks because its leaders saw themselves as insurgents seeking to overturn Arab governments that they deemed apostates.Libyan news media reported last week that a senior Islamic State leader had personally visited Sirte, stirring speculation about the main group\u2019s plans for its local branch."}
