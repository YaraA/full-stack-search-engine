Over the last weekend alone, the Italian authorities recovered three bodies and rescued more than 5,400 people, most crossing the Mediterranean from Libya in overcrowded, rickety boats run by people smugglers.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThey know about Salaam, this place is known in Africa, and before they even leave Libya they think about coming here,\u201d said Bahar Abdalla, from Sudan, a longtime resident. \u201cWe won\u2019t send anyone away. But we\u2019re worried. This can\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\nFew migrants voluntarily ask for asylum in Italy, but rather hope to continue to northern Europe, making Salaam Palace a way station for some, and a permanent home for others forced to remain in the country as a result of the European Union\u2019s so-called Dublin regulation. Intended to discourage multiple asylum claims, the rule calls for asylum seekers to request refugee status in the first member state they enter.\n\nHuman rights workers say the rule does not provide efficient or effective protection for the migrants, and puts a disproportionate burden on the European countries that border the Mediterranean.\n\nLast October, after several hundred migrants died in an accident off the island of Lampedusa, the southernmost Italian point in the Mediterranean, the European Union stepped up naval patrols, both to control the flow of migrants and to assist vessels in distress. Critics say the patrols have only increased the incentives for migrants to risk the dangerous passage. More and more keep coming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNow they arrive still covered in sea salt,\u201d said Donatella D\u2019Angelo, a doctor with the volunteer group Cittadini del Mondo, or Citizens of the World, which has run the weekly medical clinic at Salaam Palace for eight years. \u201cIn the past at least they\u2019d get fed and cleaned in reception centers on Lampedusa.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis crisis has been dumped onto the occupied centers, rather than being handled at a national and European level, on the part of those who have the power to actually do something,\u201d she said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many charities and institutions responded, she said, including an elementary school that took up a collection of toothbrushes and toothpaste.\n\nOn a recent evening, dozens of young men \u2014 several in their teens \u2014 and women and children of varying ages lined up patiently to receive toiletries and clothing from volunteers, assisted by longtime residents.\n\n\u201cAs it is, it\u2019s not easy to live here, we had to set them up in the garage on mattresses because it\u2019s all we had to offer,\u201d said Ibrahim Abdala, a volunteer originally from Darfur, in Sudan, who has lived in the building for six years.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne young Eritrean woman smiled shyly and nodded when Rosana Patti, a volunteer who normally teaches weekly Italian classes here, pulled a pink T-shirt from a cardboard box of donated women\u2019s clothes. \u201cIf things don\u2019t calm down,\u201d Ms. Patti said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how we can keep up.\u201d\n\nCritics of Italy\u2019s system say that assistance to asylum seekers and refugees is fragmented among too many different agencies that do not coordinate among themselves. Without more effective programs to integrate the migrants into society, the situation is \u201ca bomb waiting to explode,\u201d said Christopher Hein, director of the Italian Refugee Council.\n\n\u201cFirst assistance to new migrants is still lacking. It\u2019s true that we\u2019re unprepared, but we\u2019re unprepared because there is no planning,\u201d said Daniela Di Capua, director of the state\u2019s asylum protection agency. \u201cItaly keeps trying to keep up with an emergency that has become ordinary.\u201d\n\nRome, like other cities still feeling the strains of Europe\u2019s long economic crisis, has struggled to provide assistance, and much of the care for those here rests with volunteers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is some evidence that the recent influx has caused the Italian authorities to take note. The health authorities met with various groups in recent weeks to discuss the situation. Officials have pledged to refurbish the medical clinic and build a deposit for donated items. The International Committee of the Red Cross set up an aid van, and one nonprofit organization has promised to clean up the garage and donate camp beds.\n\nMayor Ignazio Marino of Rome visited Salaam Palace last September with a delegation from City Hall and also promised help. But for those who have lived in Salaam Palace for years, the assurances of official assistance have little coinage.\n\n\u201cMarino came, he spoke with us, but in the end it\u2019s as if he hadn\u2019t come, nothing has changed, it\u2019s just getting worse,\u201d said Ali, a resident of Salaam Palace who declined to give his last name. The residents have protested countless times for help, to no avail, he said. \u201cGovernments have come and gone but nothing has happened, just a lot of talk and we\u2019re still in the same boat, waiting.\u201d\n\nMayor Marino sees the problem as extending beyond Rome. Europe as a whole \u201chas to offer opportunities to people, not just beds, but new opportunities for their lives,\u201d he said in a telephone interview earlier this year. He called for a strategic plan for refugees.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenge that has to be faced at the European Union level,\u201d he said."}
