{"title": "Brussels Attacks Fuel Debate Over Migrants in a Fractured Europe", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/world/europe/belgium-attacks-migrants.html", "body": "The attacks will also put more strain on the deal brokered last week by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany with the Turkish government to restrict the migrant flow into Europe, in return for more liberal visa arrangements for travel into Europe by Turkish nationals. That deal was already being criticized as a security threat to Europe and had been questioned on humanitarian and legal grounds.\n\n\u201cIn the public eye everything gets connected: the mass abuse in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve and the attacks today,\u201d said Rem Korteweg, a security analyst at the Center for European Reform in London, referring to the sexual abuse and robberies in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve that were linked to migrants. \u201cHowever different, in the public mind and for the euroskeptic populace, they\u2019re all the same thing.\u201d\n\nThe fierce reaction was evident on Tuesday in Germany, where Ms. Merkel\u2019s popularity has been dented by her decision to open the country\u2019s borders to more than one million migrants last year, aiding the Alternative for Germany party in recent state elections. Officials in Ms. Merkel\u2019s government who made the usual statements of support for victims were mocked and criticized on social media.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThe despicable attacks in Brussels draw us all together: Solidarity with the victims + determination against the terrorists,\u201d Ms. Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe response was fast and fierce. \u201cWhoever opens the borders and supports uncontrolled immigration, giving terrorists free run, has no place pretending here!\u201d wrote a man calling himself Paul Paul. Another user, Roland Z, wrote of Ms. Merkel: \u201cYour boss is still bringing these Islamists to Germany in hordes.\u201d And a user with the name Eva-Maria Schultheis posted: \u201cMs. Merkel welcomed them all with open arms and this is what it has led to.\u201d\n\nEven those not directly blaming the migrants or the politicians showed the strain of attacks that struck four months apart on public places in major European cities. \u201cWe\u2019re anxious,\u201d said another Twitter user, Johanna Bayer. \u201c Paris-Brussels \u2014 the attacks are getting ever closer.\u201d\n\nThe authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the German state next to Belgium, announced tighter controls on the border on Tuesday, with the state\u2019s interior minister leveling unusually sharp public criticism at his Belgian colleagues. North Rhine includes Cologne, where the New Year\u2019s Eve attacks took place.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBelgium failed to discover a terrorist cell in the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek and \u201cshould possibly have acted sooner,\u201d said Ralf J\u00e4ger, the minister. \u201dIt\u2019s not a question of individual actors organizing themselves \u2014 on the contrary, the mode of action was structured and agreed,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that is what is frightening: that such a cell could not be discovered.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHis comments were quickly derided by Armin Laschet, the leader of the opposition in North Rhine-Westphalia, who suggested that Mr. J\u00e4ger, under fire for the policing failures in Cologne, would do better to keep quiet.\n\nThis fear of refugees and immigrants, which is tied to anxieties about globalization and losses of both jobs and national identity, is not just a European issue. Donald J. Trump has gained traction with his promise to build a wall between the United States and Mexico and his association of Muslims with terrorism and immigrants with crime.\n\nBut in Europe, the insecurity around migration and terrorism has challenged key beliefs and principles of the European Union.\n\nThe Schengen area of visa-free travel across 26 countries has already broken down under the pressure of the migrant flow, with many worried that the zone may never be fully resurrected because of terrorism. Analysts say that attacks like those in Paris and Brussels make it far more likely that European governments will insist on stricter passport, visa and luggage checks at their borders.\n\nMike Hookem, a member of the European Parliament from the U.K. Independence Party, said that the \u201chorrific act of terrorism shows that Schengen free movement and lax border controls are a threat to our security.\u201d\n\nThere have also been various reports of migrants traveling to Europe on false Syrian passports, sometimes taken from the dead, and of overwhelmed authorities unable to keep track of the thousands of people traveling the roads and railways.\n\nHolger Schmieding of Berenberg, Germany\u2019s largest private bank, warned that while \u201clogic would suggest that a terror attack strengthens the case for closer cooperation in Europe,\u201d the attacks instead \u201cmay trigger a knee-jerk reaction to get further away from the European Continent, and Brussels especially, among those who are somewhat skeptical of what \u2018Brussels\u2019 stands for anyway.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSad as it is,\u201d he added, \u201cthere is some risk that the terror attacks may end up strengthening the \u2018leave-the-E.U\u2019 camp.\u201d\n\nMigrants themselves intrinsically understand the connection between their precarious situation and the violence. On Tuesday, at the Kara Tepe refugee camp on the island of Lesbos in Greece, Abdullah Zahed, 25, and his wife, Breshna Alawee, 27, who fled Afghanistan in early March, pleaded for understanding.\n\n\u201cWe are refugees,\u201d Ms. Alawee said. \u201cWe are not terrorists.\u201d\n\nMr. Zahed added: \u201cWe ourselves are running from these types of attacks in Afghanistan.\u201d", "summary": "Even those not directly blaming the migrants or the politicians showed the strain of attacks that struck four months apart on public places in major European cities.His comments were quickly derided by Armin Laschet, the leader of the opposition in North Rhine-Westphalia, who suggested that Mr. J\u00e4ger, under fire for the policing failures in Cologne, would do better to keep quiet.Donald J.
