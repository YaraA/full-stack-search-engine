Turkey jailed more journalists than any other country in 2016, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut both sides are now accusing each other of stifling free speech, with Turkish officials charging that they are being blocked from campaigning in Germany.\n\nTwo Turkish ministers campaigning in Germany on Mr. Erdogan\u2019s behalf scrapped rallies last week after local German authorities said they could not guarantee security. Germany\u2019s federal government has denied intervening in any way.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Erdogan accused Berlin of using Nazi tactics and threatened to stir a revolt if he decided to go to Germany himself and was somehow prevented from entering. (He previously campaigned in Germany in 2008, 2011 and 2014.)\n\n\u201cSome friends talked about fascism,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said at a dinner event in Istanbul. \u201cI was thinking that fascism is over in Germany, but it is still ongoing. It is ongoing, obviously.\u201d\n\nThen he added: \u201cMy brothers, now they think Erdogan is supposed to come to Germany. I would come if I want to. I could come and set the world on fire if you don\u2019t let me come in, or you don\u2019t allow me to talk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Monday, Ms. Merkel told reporters, \u201cOne can\u2019t even really seriously comment on such misplaced statements.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, said Mr. Erdogan\u2019s language was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d and that the government would relay that message to Turkey.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cConcerning the rule of law, tolerance and liberalism, Germany is not to be bested,\u201d Mr. Altmaier said.\n\nAnalysts and commentators urged calm and noted that the sparring would benefit no one. Germany and Turkey are bound by the NATO alliance, aid from the European Union and an additional European Union agreement, negotiated by Ms. Merkel and worth up to six billion euros, or $6.3 billion, if Turkey keeps refugees from fleeing across the Aegean Sea to Greece and into Central Europe.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that we have no interest in a rising spiral of insults \u2014 an insult arms race, or however you want to put it,\u201d said Volker Perthes, the director of the German Institute for Security and International Affairs, a government-funded think tank in Berlin. \u201cThat will not help us.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the Netherlands, the nationalist Geert Wilders, who leads polls for elections this month but is unlikely to become prime minister, said he would declare all of Turkey\u2019s ministers persona non grata.\n\nIn Turkey, opposition politicians criticized the decision to block Mr. Erdogan\u2019s allies from speaking to German Turks. The leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, accused Germany of hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cYou teach democracy to the world, but you forbid two ministers from speaking with this or that excuse,\u201d Mr. Kilicdaroglu said on Friday, in comments reported by Hurriyet Daily News.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut some of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s opponents noted the irony of the president defending his right to free speech in Europe, while eroding that of citizens at home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAysun Gezen, one of an estimated 4,000 academics purged from Turkish universities since the failed coup last year, said her case highlighted the Turkish government\u2019s intolerance of dissident voices within its own borders.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to say that there is freedom of speech in Turkey,\u201d argued Ms. Gezen, who was a political scientist at Ankara University before being fired last year for signing a petition that criticized the government\u2019s actions toward Kurds. She and her fellow petitioners were accused of creating terrorist propaganda.\n\nIn addition to academics like Ms. Gezen, more than 120,000 government employees are estimated to have been fired or suspended in recent months for perceived opposition to the government.\n\nOn the day that Mr. Kilicdaroglu, the opposition leader, defended his opponents\u2019 right to campaign in Germany, he also lamented his side\u2019s inability to campaign freely in Turkey.\n\nIn an interview last week with The New York Times, he said that the whole Turkish state apparatus was being mobilized behind the yes campaign, while voices in the private news media are stifled.\n\nState officials had made it hard for his colleagues to rent spaces for campaign events, Mr. Kilicdaroglu argued, while the police in Istanbul had failed to properly investigate claims that a group of no-campaigners had been shot at.\n\n\u201cWe repeat the same thing 100 times, but with the problem in the media, we can\u2019t deliver our message to the masses,\u201d Mr. Kilicdaroglu said.", "summary": "Two Turkish ministers campaigning in Germany on Mr. Erdogan\u2019s behalf scrapped rallies last week after local German authorities said they could not guarantee security. \u201cIt is impossible to say that there is freedom of speech in Turkey,\u201d argued Ms. Gezen, who was a political scientist at Ankara University before being fired last year for signing a petition that criticized the government\u2019s actions toward Kurds.
