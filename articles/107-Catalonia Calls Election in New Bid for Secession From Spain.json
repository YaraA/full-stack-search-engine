At the same time, statements from him and his government have grown more threatening.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNobody is going to steal from Catalans their triple status as Catalans, Spaniards and Europeans,\u201d Mr. Rajoy told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cNobody will break up Spain in any way.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s justice minister, Rafael Catal\u00e1, warned last month that, if Catalonia\u2019s leadership violates the Constitution, Madrid was empowered to effectively seize control of Catalonia\u2019s administration and suspend its regional autonomy.\n\nMr. Rajoy and Mr. Mas have been at loggerheads for three years. What started as a financial dispute over the tax contributions Catalonia should make to the rest of recession-hit Spain has turned into a full-fledged secession battle.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Catalan leader has also been emboldened by street protests in favor of independence \u2014 the next of which is scheduled for Sept. 11, Catalonia\u2019s National Day.\n\nMr. Rajoy and Mr. Mas have in some ways benefited from feuding about Catalonia\u2019s future, at a time when both men have been undermined by corruption investigations relating to the financing of their respective parties.\n\nFor Mr. Rajoy, it has allowed his governing Popular Party to present itself as Spain\u2019s flag-bearer while highlighting the ambivalence of other national parties toward Catalonia, notably Podemos, an insurgent far-left party that is competing in its first general election.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For sure, but we have now at least on Sept. 27 the right to vote legally.\u201d\n\nMr. Romeva said Catalonia first needed to gain control of its economy before considering how best to improve it.\n\nAs part of their secessionist plans, Catalan officials have recently talked about setting up an autonomous Catalan tax agency, based on the fiscal model of countries like Sweden and Australia.\n\n\u201cThese elections aren\u2019t about presenting an economic program \u2014 they go beyond that,\u201d Mr. Romeva said. \u201cA lot of the things that we want to do and change in terms of social economy and policies first require gaining resources that we don\u2019t have today.\u201d\n\nBut by calling a Catalan election a year ahead of schedule, Mr. Mas is forcing Catalans to confront their future without first finding out whether Mr. Rajoy can win another general election.\n\nIn elections in May, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party lost control of Madrid\u2019s city hall, as well as Valencia and other regions that it had long dominated.\n\nSome here clearly preferred that the Catalan leader had waited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that Catalonia has reached a point of no return, but rather that we\u2019ve reached a complete breakdown in communications, which Rajoy has done nothing to improve, making it also easier for our own politicians to sell the nonsense message that we\u2019re somehow smarter than the rest of Spain,\u201d said Carlos Rivadulla, the deputy president of Businessmen of Catalonia, an association of entrepreneurs who oppose Catalan independence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf the Popular Party doesn\u2019t win the next election,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be room for a new dialogue and to change radically the situation.\u201d"}
