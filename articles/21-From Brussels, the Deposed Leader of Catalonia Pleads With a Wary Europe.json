{"title": "From Brussels, the Deposed Leader of Catalonia Pleads With a Wary Europe", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger", "Raphael Minder"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/europe/puigdemont-catalonia-belgium-spain.html", "body": "On Friday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the most pro-European of European leaders, said bluntly that the European Union \u201cdoesn\u2019t need any more cracks, more splits.\u201d\n\nMr. Juncker, the president of the European Commission and himself from tiny Luxembourg, said that the bloc should not intervene in \u201can internal debate for Spain, but I wouldn\u2019t want the European Union to consist of 95 member states in the future.\u201d\n\nAfter Catalan separatists declared independence last Friday, Mr. Rajoy dismissed Mr. Puigdemont and his cabinet and dissolved the Catalan Parliament, calling for regional elections on Dec. 21.\n\nIn Brussels, Mr. Puigdemont welcomed the chance for separatists to win the December elections. He said he would \u201caccept the results\u201d and called on Madrid to make \u201ca clear commitment\u201d to do the same.\n\nMr. Puigdemont emphasized that he was not escaping Spanish justice, but he said he wanted guarantees of a fair trial and would work for now from Brussels, in \u201cfreedom and security.\u201d\n\nAfter reading the charges proposed by the Spanish attorney general, Mr. Puigdemont said he felt Catalan politicians would not be treated fairly by the Spanish judiciary.\n\nVideo\n\nThe possible charges, he argued, amounted to \u201ca persecution\u201d of people and their ideas rather than specific crimes. \u201cMore than a desire for justice, it is a desire for vengeance,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile he ruled out asking for political asylum from Belgium, he could do so in the future, especially if Spain seeks his arrest and extradition.\n\nMr. Puigdemont\u2019s Belgian lawyer, Paul Bekaert, said that \u201cas long as the possibility exists that Spain asks to extradite Puigdemont, it can\u2019t be excluded that he applies for political asylum.\u201d\n\nMr. Bekaert, 68, who specializes in asylum cases, has worked in the past for Basque separatists who sought asylum here to avoid trial on terrorism charges in Spain. He said he didn\u2019t know how long Mr. Puigdemont would stay.\n\n\u201cHe came here to work in total peace and security,\u201d Mr. Bekaert said. \u201cIn the meantime, we are on standby.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Mr. Bekaert told Flemish Radio: \u201cAs a citizen of the European Union, he can in fact apply for political asylum here. Whether he obtains it is another question.\u201d\n\nLate Tuesday, some members of the ousted Catalan cabinet flew back to Barcelona from Brussels, triggering speculation about another possible change of mind by Mr. Puigdemont. But he was not on board the plane.\n\nMr. Puigdemont\u2019s presence in Brussels was intended to add a European dimension to Spain\u2019s most serious political crisis in decades. He is in effect proposing to lead his ousted Catalan government from a city that is home to the main institutions of the European Union, which has been unsympathetic to the push for secession, and is in a country that has its own separatist tensions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Already anxious about Scotland\u2019s previous calls for independence, states like France, Italy and even Belgium have no interest in encouraging regional secessionist movements in places like Corsica, Lombardy, South Tyrol and Flanders.\n\nAnd Spain, with a strongly recovering economy, is considered a model of democratic transformation after the Franco era under the umbrella and tutelage of the European Union. A Spanish failure would be perceived as a European one, just as Brussels feels that the bloc is regaining some of its confidence.\n\nMr. Puigdemont and several members of his ousted cabinet made their way to Brussels on Monday just as the Spanish attorney general, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Maza, announced in Madrid that Mr. Puigdemont and other separatist leaders should appear \u201curgently\u201d in court there.\n\nThose in Brussels may avoid the Spanish courts, but they will not find much support from any European Union official. And even as Mr. Puigdemont and others sat tight in Brussels, the Spanish Supreme Court summoned a handful of other Catalan lawmakers to appear in Madrid on Thursday, including Carme Forcadell, the president of the Catalan Parliament who read out the declaration of independence last week.\n\nMr. Maza chose not to order the immediate arrest of the separatists, but he wants judges to allow him to pursue charges of rebellion, sedition and the misuse of public funds against those who organized and carried out an illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Puigdemont said the length of his Brussels stay was dependent \u201con the circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we could be guaranteed that the trial would be fair,\u201d he said, \u201cwithout doubt I would return immediately.\u201d\n\nHad he and his entire cabinet stayed in Barcelona this week, he said, \u201cwith an attitude of resistance, there would have been a very violent reaction by the state,\u201d he argued.\n\nMr. Puigdemont said he had not been negotiating with Belgian politicians. \u201cI don\u2019t ask anything from Belgian politicians, except as part of European politics,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, he repeated his call for the European Union to step into the conflict, a plea that has been rejected by European leaders. \u201cTo the international community and especially Europe, I ask them to react,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he waits, the national government in Madrid took direct administrative control of Catalonia, using emergency constitutional powers invoked by Mr. Rajoy.\n\nMr. Puigdemont called on Catalan citizens to oppose the dismantling of Catalonia\u2019s institutions, while officials in Madrid welcomed the news that Mr. Puigdemont had chosen to leave Spain rather than remain in Barcelona and resist the national government\u2019s decision to oust him.", "summary": "He is in effect proposing to lead his ousted Catalan government from a city that is home to the main institutions of the European Union, which has been unsympathetic to the push for secession, and is in a country that has its own separatist tensions.More important, however, the European Union is also wary of Mr. Puigdemont, whose appeal to a Europe of \u201cdemocracy, liberty, free expression and nonviolence,\u201d as he put it, indicated a romantic view of the bloc.That view has become outdated in a bloc under severe nationalist strains stemming from the debt crisis, the migration wave, the fear of terrorism and the populism that all of those anxieties have engendered.Already anxious about Scotland\u2019s previous calls for independence, states like France, Italy and even Belgium have no interest in encouraging regional secessionist movements in places like Corsica, Lombardy, South Tyrol and Flanders.Mr. Maza chose not to order the immediate arrest of the separatists, but he wants judges to allow him to pursue charges of rebellion, sedition and the misuse of public funds against those who organized and carried out an illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1."}
