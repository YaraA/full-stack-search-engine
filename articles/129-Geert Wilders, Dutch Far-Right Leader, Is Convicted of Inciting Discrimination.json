{"title": "Geert Wilders, Dutch Far-Right Leader, Is Convicted of Inciting Discrimination", "authors": ["Nina Siegal"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/europe/geert-wilders-netherlands-trial.html", "body": "Prime Minister Mark Rutte, leader of the center-right People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy, said a year ago that he would refuse to join such a coalition unless Mr. Wilders retracted his comments about Moroccans. Mr. Rutte confirmed that sentiment at his weekly news conference on Friday, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMr. Wilders, whose defense team said he would appeal the decision next week, was not present when the verdict was read by the chief judge, Hendrik Steenhuis, at a secured courtroom on a military base near Schiphol Airport, outside Amsterdam.\n\nThe site was chosen to protect Mr. Wilders, who has been under constant guard because of death threats related to a long history of inflammatory comments, as well as the judge and prosecutors.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that he is found guilty of group insult and inciting discrimination,\u201d said a spokesman for the public prosecution service, Frans Zonneveld. \u201cFor now, we\u2019re very satisfied that he has been found guilty of these two charges.\u201d\n\nIn their ruling, the judges said that Mr. Wilders\u2019s comments at the rally had contributed to the further polarization of Dutch society by using \u201cnationality as an ethnic designation\u201d and that mutual respect was imperative in the \u201cpluralistic\u201d Netherlands.\n\n\u201cHe said that he was supported by millions of people and therefore was not to blame of offending a group,\u201d Judge Steenhuis said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to answer the question of whether he was guilty of this. That question is answered in our court system. We state that you cannot offend groups of people and discriminate against them.\u201d\n\nMr. Wilders, who has taken a page out of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s playbook \u2014 he adopted the campaign slogan \u201cMake the Netherlands Great Again\u201d and attended the Republican convention in the United States \u2014 has repeatedly made vitriolic and inflammatory remarks about Islam, the Quran, immigrants and Dutch minority groups. Since the election of Mr. Trump, the Party for Freedom has been surging in the polls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI still cannot believe it, but I have just been convicted because I asked a question about Moroccans,\u201d Mr. Wilders said in a video that was posted online.\n\n\u201cThe Netherlands have become a sick country,\u201d he added. \u201cI have a message for the judges who convicted me: You have restricted the freedom of speech of millions of Dutch and hence convicted everyone. No one trusts you anymore.\u201d\n\nPeter Kanne, a pollster with I&O Research, an independent Dutch polling organization, said the most recent data, released on Nov. 25, indicated that the Party for Freedom had gained support and was currently about even with the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy, the leading party.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cA lot of people mentioned that they\u2019re really getting angry that he is being accused and judged only for what he said,\u201d Mr. Kanne said. \u201cThey think that he said something that is true, and they\u2019re very angry that a politician cannot say that in a society where there is freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Wilders\u2019s comments about Moroccans in 2014, more than 6,400 Dutch citizens filed complaints against him at local police offices. Of those complaints, 41 became individual claimants in the criminal trial, asking for up to \u20ac500 in \u201cimmaterial damages\u201d per person. None will receive compensation from Mr. Wilders in the case, the panel ruled.\n\nMichiel Pestman, a lawyer representing some of the claimants, said that his clients were \u201chappy with the results\u201d but added that it was rare for criminal courts in the Netherlands to convict someone without imposing a penalty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit weird,\u201d he said, but \u201cthe principled nature of the decision is more important than the compensation.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe judge has ruled for the first time in the Netherlands that there are limits to what even a politician can say.\u201d\n\nJust before the official court proceedings began on Oct. 31, Mr. Wilders said on his blog that he would boycott what he called \u201ca travesty\u201d against freedom of speech, but he changed his mind and testified during the defense\u2019s closing arguments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRegardless of the verdict, he said, \u201cno one will be able to silence me.\u201d", "summary": "Prime Minister Mark Rutte, leader of the center-right People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy, said a year ago that he would refuse to join such a coalition unless Mr. Wilders retracted his comments about Moroccans.
