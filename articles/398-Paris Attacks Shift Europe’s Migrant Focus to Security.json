But in recent weeks, European countries from Sweden to Slovenia have been enacting new border controls, erecting border fences and discussing ways to better screen and register the migrants.\n\nAnd since the attacks by militants, and the discovery of a passport of a recent Syrian migrant near the scene of a suicide bombing, the rising antimigrant sentiment seems poised to substantially shift the conversation. Perhaps it could even change both policies and attitudes toward the migrants, as they arrive, make their way across Europe and land in the countries where they hope to make their homes.\n\nIn the short run, this shift in tone could complicate the only significant plan that the European Union now has to slow down or bring order to the resettling of more than a million people: its plans to relocate 160,000 migrants across Europe. It could also affect future attempts by the bloc and others to fashion a more comprehensive and unified approach to the crisis.\n\nGermany, which has accepted the largest number of migrants and is the destination of choice for many of them, is crucial to any solution to the crisis. But even there resistance is growing.\n\n\u201cThe days of uncontrolled immigration and illegal entry can\u2019t continue just like that,\u201d insisted Markus S\u00f6der, the finance minister of Bavaria and a leader of its Christian Social Union, in an interview on Sunday with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \u201cParis changes everything.\u201d\n\nMuch of the harshest language is coming from Eastern European leaders, who have never been warm to the arrival of thousands of largely poor and Muslim migrants. Since the attacks in Paris on Friday, leaders have stepped up their criticism.\n\nKarl Erjavec, Slovenia\u2019s foreign minister, warned that the Paris attacks made it clear that hiding among the throngs of migrants are some \u201cwith bad intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis atrocious act confirms that we are entering difficult times,\u201d said Milos Zeman, the president of the Czech Republic. \u201cWe cannot fight international terror with protests and demonstrations anymore.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAndrej Babis, the Czech finance minister, said that Europe was at war and that concrete steps needed to be taken \u2014 including, perhaps, closing the open borders of the Schengen group, which made passport-free travel possible among 26 nations, one of the Continent\u2019s proudest achievements.\n\nThe concerns were not limited to government officials.\n\n\u201cAlong with refugees, there are also terrorists coming,\u201d Mariana Koleva, 40, said on a shopping trip to Edirne, Turkey, from her home in Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want Romania now to receive migrants, especially after what happened in Paris,\u201d said Gabriela, 38, a bank analyst in Bucharest who declined to give her last name because her employer would not approve. \u201cWe could also be in danger in the future.\u201d\n\nJean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, who made an impassioned speech this summer urging a unified bloc response to the migrants, again urged tolerance.\n\n\u201cThose who organized these attacks, and those who carried them out, are exactly those who the refugees are fleeing,\u201d Mr. Juncker told reporters Sunday at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Antalya, Turkey. \u201cAnd so there is no need for an overall review of the European policy on refugees.\u201d\n\nMarie Hermanova, the spokeswoman for a team of Czech volunteers who have been working with the migrants, said her group was bracing for a rising anti-migrant mood.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Paris on Friday night is happening in Syria every day, and it is exactly why those people are running away,\u201d she said. \u201cOur volunteers are extremely unhappy about the wave of hate this will likely release.\u201d\n\nTereza Novak, the director of Slovenska Filantropija, a humanitarian organization that has worked with migrants for two decades, echoed those concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that such violence gives wings to those who spread fear and loathing of refugees,\u201d she said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There might even be support for Poland\u2019s taking part in a military coalition to defeat the Islamic State, he said.\n\nIn Germany, for weeks Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Bavarian allies have been calling for an upper limit on the number of migrants the country can handle.\n\nIn his interview with Welt, Mr. S\u00f6der, the Bavarian finance minister, said, \u201cIt would be good if Angela Merkel acknowledged that the opening of the border for an unlimited period of time was a mistake.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel, however, was giving no indication that she was thinking of shifting her stance. And, said Klemen Groselj, a security and defense analyst in Slovenia, that is the stance that most matters.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens anywhere in Europe, when it comes to the migrant crisis, all eyes immediately turn to Germany and what the chancellor will do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile countries on the Balkan route from Greece to Slovenia and Austria are doing a lot of posturing on sovereign decision-making and protecting their national interests, the fact of the matter is there is so much codependency that any talk of an individual country doing something original, security-wise, following the attacks is simply not feasible.\u201d\n\nThe Paris attacks, Mr. Groselj said, have reduced the number of questions facing European officials about the migrant crisis to one: \u201cDo they allow the migrant flow to continue or do they stop it?\u201d\n\nPressure may ease on Germany \u2014 and other nations \u2014 simply because the number of migrants passing into Europe has been slowing, driven by worsening weather and other factors.\n\nOn Friday, 5,700 migrants entered Germany at the five crossing points most often used, said Angelika Kaltenbacher, a spokeswoman for the federal police. On Saturday, the total was 5,830.\n\nThose are substantial numbers, but well below the 8,000 a day or more who crossed in September and October.\n\nThe answer to the Paris attacks, said Peter N. Bouckaert, the emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, is not to shut the door on those desperately fleeing war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, including many fleeing from the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThe answer is to put in place a coherent E.U. asylum policy that provides those fleeing war and repression with safe and legal alternatives to get that asylum, without having to risk their lives,\u201d Mr. Bouckaert said in a Facebook post.\n\nStanding outside the French Embassy in Riga, Latvia, Marcis Zitmanis, 35, watched his daughter light a candle in an array of flowers and letters of condolence.\n\n\u201cWe should not blame the migrants,\u201d said Mr. Zitmanis, a construction engineer. \u201cIf we help them more, the risk of a terror attack happening again would be less.\u201d", "summary": "WARSAW \u2014 With hundreds of thousands of migrants pouring across its borders, and economic and political pressure growing to enact tighter controls, Europe has nevertheless stayed fairly steady in its response to the humanitarian emergency.
