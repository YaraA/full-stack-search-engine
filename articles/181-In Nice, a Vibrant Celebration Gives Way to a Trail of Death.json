The driver jumped out, asking, \u201cWhere are the wounded?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only have dead here,\u201d replied two men, trying to comfort a young man who was weeping over the body of his mother and imploring Allah to accept her into heaven.\n\nAn eerie tableau of death and dying extended along a mile-long stretch of the graceful, crescent-shaped Promenade des Anglais on Thursday night, running from Nice\u2019s airport to the oldest part of the coastal city.\n\nOne moment, there was a great street celebration for France\u2019s Bastille Day holiday \u2014 and the next, a truck came barreling through at high speed, leaving a trail of bodies, shock and despair through a French Riviera fiesta.\n\nAmong the first people killed by the speeding truck on the sidewalk next to Lenval Beach was the middle-aged Muslim woman. Two of her sons and other family members stood, weeping or frozen in stunned silence, around her body, which was covered in a pale blue tartan blanket.\n\nNearby there was another victim, an unidentified man sprawled on the sidewalk next to the beach beneath a bloodied sheet.\n\nSo numerous were the bodies that to protect their dignity, people had covered some of them with tablecloths snatched from the restaurants lining the Promenade des Anglais.\n\nIt was windy, with a slight, sporadic drizzle, and the celebration of just a few moments earlier was already a distant memory. Crowds had gathered to celebrate Bastille Day, France\u2019s most popular holiday. The woman and the man had been there, with so many others, along the broad seafront promenade, as Nice\u2019s annual fireworks display lit up the night sky.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey were all easy prey \u2014 or, in the parlance of an era when this kind of killing has become all too common, they were soft targets.\n\nThe evening had been filled with bangs and flashes of light as fireworks displays rolled along France\u2019s southern coast, drawing cheers from delighted families whose main worry for much of the day had been whether rain might force the cancellation of the celebration.\n\nThis was not a military base, or a guarded government building. It was simply a crowd celebrating in the street. Like the fans at the Bataclan, gunned down in Paris during a concert; or the newspaper staff of Charlie Hebdo; or the people blown up outside the airport in Turkey.\n\nVideo\n\nThis time, all it took was a murderous driver and a massive truck. Witnesses said the truck had entered the Promenade des Anglais from a side street near the Foundation Lenval children\u2019s hospital, turned left and mounted the sidewalk opposite a row of balconied seaside villas and apartment buildings.\n\nThe driver then drove deeper into the city, mowing down victim after victim as the truck plowed through increasingly dense crowds of revelers.\n\nPierre Roux, whose apartment faces the sea, said he had first thought that the truck was simply out of control. But then he noticed that the lights were off and there was no honking.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cNobody in the way stood a chance,\u201d he said.\n\nHe had come out of his apartment early Friday to place a burning candle on a white sheet covering a body that was unattended.\n\nAs he spoke, heavily armed police officers sealed off a widening perimeter of the city.\n\nSimon Cotteridge, who also lives along the promenade, said he had been watching the fireworks. Just after the display ended, he said, there was \u201ca tremendous thud.\u201d\n\nHe wondered if it had been some sort of coda to the fireworks show, or perhaps an accident. But then, he said, he saw a dozen bodies on the pavement \u2014 and a big crowd of people \u201crunning and screaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was horrific,\u201d Mr. Cotteridge said.", "summary": "An eerie tableau of death and dying extended along a mile-long stretch of the graceful, crescent-shaped Promenade des Anglais on Thursday night, running from Nice\u2019s airport to the oldest part of the coastal city.
