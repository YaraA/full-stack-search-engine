{"title": "For Ukrainian Leader, Disparate Paths to Cross", "authors": ["Ellen Barry"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/world/europe/for-ukrainian-leader-disparate-paths-to-cross.html", "body": "Mr. Yanukovich, a former Soviet apparatchik from the bare-knuckled coal mining region of Donetsk, narrowly defeated Ms. Tymoshenko in 2010, wresting the country back from the pro-Western coalition that once defeated him. Though many expected him to lead the country into Moscow\u2019s orbit, he chose Brussels for his first foreign visit, declaring European integration to be a centerpiece of his presidency.\n\nHe also began a crackdown on the opposition. Of the 11 political figures singled out by prosecutors, according to a report by the International Republican Institute, the most prominent was Ms. Tymoshenko, a populist firebrand with a trademark corona of thick flaxen braids. She went on trial this summer on charges that she agreed to inflated prices in a 2009 agreement to buy Russian natural gas \u2014 a charge that she, and many in the West, have dismissed as a pretext for excluding her from politics.\n\nThough American and European diplomats were watching the case closely, it was not until Ms. Tymoshenko was arrested for contempt in August that \u201ceverybody drew a deep breath and said, \u2018My God, they\u2019re serious about\u2019 \u201d sentencing her to a prison term, said a senior Western diplomat, speaking anonymously in keeping with protocol.\n\nWhat began then was a campaign to impress Mr. Yanukovich with the penalties that might result if she is put in prison: European Union leaders might withdraw an invitation to visit Brussels on Oct. 20, and next year, member countries may not ratify the free trade agreement, after four years and 19 rounds of talks, the diplomat said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

More likely, the diplomat said, is a murky legal scenario that allows Mr. Yanukovich to address some Western complaints without losing face before his electorate, perhaps by convicting her and then decriminalizing the statute under which she was charged.\n\nAmong those who will be watching are Russia\u2019s leaders, who are hoping Ukraine rejects the European Union agreement in favor of a Customs Union that includes Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Russia has offered deep discounts on natural gas, as well as a membership process far simpler than the European one. So far, this has failed to dissuade Mr. Yanukovich from his plans for integration with Europe.\n\n\u201cThey have been enticing Yanukovich with all sorts of benefits, but Yanukovich isn\u2019t buying,\u201d Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said of the Russians. \u201cThey clearly see the Tymoshenko case as a godsend opportunity, but they also know there is precious little they can do about the outcome.\u201d\n\nThe president himself has chided Western leaders for raising the case with him, telling a briefing in Warsaw that \u201cjustice is an independent branch of power, and the European Union realizes this very well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, many here believe his choice will be crucial.\n\nAndrew Wilson, author of a recent book on Ukraine, called Mr. Yanukovich \u201ca proud man, proud of having fought his way up from the bottom.\u201d He said the president\u2019s dilemma may trace back to his rough-and-tumble origins in the coal country of Donetsk.\n\n\u201cDonetsk is a very specific, clannish political culture,\u201d said Mr. Wilson, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. It has, he said, \u201cclear and simple rules \u2014 you reward your friends and punish your enemies, and that has to be done in a public way, so that people know who\u2019s boss.\u201d\n\nMs. Mostovaya warned against oversimplifying Mr. Yanukovich or his decision-making process. She said he relied on a wide variety of advisers \u2014 American and Russian, as well as Ukrainian \u2014 and reserves the right to choose among them. She compared these consultations to transparent plastic barrels that were filled with plastic balls and used to pick lottery winners on Soviet television.\n\n\u201cThat barrel, it is Yanukovich\u2019s head,\u201d she said. \u201cHe listens to everyone who is admitted to him \u2014 and there are different people \u2014 and watches the balance in his surroundings. Everyone is bringing him his own argument, his own ball. Which one will roll out later on, nobody knows.\u201d"}
