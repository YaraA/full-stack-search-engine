Cohen, a former acting under secretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security and now a professor at the Faith-Based Community Security Program at Rutgers University.\n\nLatest Updates\n\nBut as the dual explosions at Brussels Airport made vividly clear, fully securing the public areas of a large, sprawling site like an airport is a daunting task.\n\nThe attack on Tuesday was not the first time that terrorists had targeted the easily accessible areas of a major European airport.\n\nIn 2011, a suicide bomber killed 37 people in the arrivals hall of Domodedovo International Airport, Moscow\u2019s busiest. A series of similar attacks occurred in the 1980s, striking airports in Frankfurt, Paris, Rome and Vienna.\n\nIn 2013, a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport killed a checkpoint security guard and wounded several other people.\n\nSome countries in recent years have introduced additional layers of security at airports, including mandatory checks of passengers and baggage at building entrances and even of arriving cars, taxis and buses. Such measures are now common at many airports in Russia and Israel, for example, as well as in much of the Middle East and parts of Africa.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKenneth S. Kasprisin, a former interim director of the T.S.A., said airports should expand screening of vehicles coming into airports, particularly larger ones.\n\nBut analysts said that while such checks could serve as a deterrent to some attackers, they are far from foolproof.\n\n\u201cThere are countries where people have to present their passport and ticket at the airport entrance,\u201d Mr. Shanks said. \u201cThat is designed to keep out non-travelers, but it won\u2019t keep out a bomber, because bombers can still buy tickets.\u201d\n\nSuch an approach also assumes that the employees charged with performing those checks are appropriately trained to spot a potential threat.\n\n\u201cSadly, at many airports where I have seen screening on entry, the staff performing this haven\u2019t actually been very efficient or effective,\u201d Mr. Shanks said. \u201cIf you are a potential bomber, you can monitor how well people are doing their job and exploit those weaknesses.\u201d\n\nOthers warned that adding security choke points outside airport terminals, rather than diminishing the threat, might simply move it to another area.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the areas of the world that have experience with suicide bombers, they often tend to blow themselves up at security checkpoints, where there are lots of people standing densely packed together,\u201d said Philip Baum, managing director of Green Light, an aviation security consulting firm in London. \u201cIf we start creating more queues of people to go through more checks, we just create new targets.\u201d\n\nSecurity experts have long argued that the most effective way to diminish threats to airports and other large public spaces involves a combination of tools, including greater use of surveillance cameras, bomb-sniffing dogs and, in particular, training more security personnel in the use of behavior-monitoring techniques.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt the moment most airport security check points are about identifying prohibited items,\u201d Mr. Baum said. \u201cSo much time is spent taking liquids and aerosols and gels off of people who pose absolutely no threat, rather than differentiating between people and recognizing that different people pose different threats.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

He said airports should also invest in technologies that can, among other things, detect changes in the behavior of people in crowds.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that you are going to stop them all, but you can have an impact,\u201d Mr. Kasprisin said.\n\nBut the use of behavior analysis remains controversial in many countries. Civil rights groups argued that the approach is too subjective and risks exposing some travelers to unwarranted profiling based on their race or ethnicity.\n\nMr. Shanks, the former Heathrow security chief, argued that closer analysis of the suspects in the Brussels attacks as they entered the departure hall could have raised suspicions for a properly trained security officer.\n\nImages from the airport\u2019s closed-circuit television cameras, Mr. Shanks noted, showed that two of the three suspects wore single black gloves on their left hands, and that none of them appeared to have any hand luggage in addition to the bags they had loaded onto airport trolleys.\n\n\u201cSomeone who is trained in behavioral analysis would have found that unusual\u201d and probably would have flagged the men for additional screening, Mr. Shanks said.\n\nUltimately, analysts said, the debate over how or whether to further enhance airport security forms part of the broader political discussion in Europe and elsewhere about how to strike the appropriate balance between safety and liberty.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly possible to implement security to such a point that your free society grinds to a halt,\u201d said Simon A. Bennett, director of the civil safety and security unit of the University of Leicester in England.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn theory, we could decide to have people queuing up outside the terminals,\u201d Mr. Bennett continued. \u201cWe could strip and cavity-search every flier. But who wants to be cavity-searched just to be able to travel where we want?\u201d", "summary": "In 2011, a suicide bomber killed 37 people in the arrivals hall of Domodedovo International Airport, Moscow\u2019s busiest.Some countries in recent years have introduced additional layers of security at airports, including mandatory checks of passengers and baggage at building entrances and even of arriving cars, taxis and buses.Others warned that adding security choke points outside airport terminals, rather than diminishing the threat, might simply move it to another area.Civil rights groups argued that the approach is too subjective and risks exposing some travelers to unwarranted profiling based on their race or ethnicity.Ultimately, analysts said, the debate over how or whether to further enhance airport security forms part of the broader political discussion in Europe and elsewhere about how to strike the appropriate balance between safety and liberty."}
