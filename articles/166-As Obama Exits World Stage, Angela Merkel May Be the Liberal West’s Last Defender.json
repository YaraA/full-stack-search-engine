{"title": "As Obama Exits World Stage, Angela Merkel May Be the Liberal West\u2019s Last Defender", "authors": ["Alison Smale", "Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/world/europe/germany-merkel-trump-election.html", "body": "Italy and Spain are politically fragile, Austria might elect a hard-right president next month, and Ms. Merkel faces difficult negotiations with Britain over its so-called Brexit.\n\nAnd with Mr. Trump advocating \u201cAmerica First\u201d and questioning the value of the NATO alliance, there is pressure on Germany to take a greater role in European security \u2014 always a delicate matter.\n\nFor the last eight years, Ms. Merkel could count on the steadfast backing of President Obama and France\u2019s \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. But with the ascent of Mr. Trump and the deep unpopularity of President Fran\u03c2ois Hollande, she has lost that vital backing.\n\nThose who follow Ms. Merkel closely say that she is weary of grappling with Europe\u2019s troubles, and that her close circle, always small, is more defensive and withdrawn after last year\u2019s migrant crisis, which has weakened her politically. Still, she is under pressure to run for a fourth four-year term, a decision expected by early December.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the last one standing, and that makes her both strong and weak at the same time,\u201d said Stefan Kornelius, one of her biographers and a political analyst for the daily newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cShe\u2019s a pillar of stability, the last wall, and people want to lean against it.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said, \u201cshe\u2019s the lightning rod for all those European populists who blame Germany for being powerful and hegemonic and setting the rules\u201d \u2014 including Alternative for Germany, the country\u2019s own rising populist party.\n\nVideo\n\nBut experience and patience count. Much like her initial response to the Brexit vote \u2014 urging calm and expressing the intent to work for a close relationship with Britain no matter what \u2014 Ms. Merkel\u2019s reaction to the election of Mr. Trump was deft.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn a fateful date when Germans are usually preoccupied with remembering Kristallnacht \u2014 the Nazis\u2019 pogroms against Jews on Nov. 9, 1938 \u2014 and the joyous fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, Ms. Merkel offered Mr. Trump her close cooperation but named a price: respect for human dignity and for minorities from a man who has mocked both.\n\nMs. Merkel had a brisk, assertive tone that was a measure of how far Germany has come since American generosity and protection enabled it to rise from Nazi defeat, first to prosper and eventually to overcome Cold War division.\n\n\u201cGermany and America are bound by common values: democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation or political views,\u201d she said. Cooperation with the United States, she said, must be \u201cbased on these values.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was stunning how she publicly laid out the rules for Trump, congratulating him but laying down conditions,\u201d Mr. Kornelius said.\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s statement would have been much more powerful if it had been delivered not just in Germany\u2019s name, said Rosa Balfour of the German Marshall Fund in Brussels.\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice had she proposed it to other European leaders and said, \u2018Let\u2019s do this together,\u2019\u201d Ms. Balfour said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Merkel, the Trump victory was also a personal blow, because she has had a mutually admiring friendship with Hillary Clinton and because it will damage the legacy of Mr. Obama.\n\nThis coming week, Mr. Obama will visit Germany after a stop in Greece on what is likely to be his last visit to Europe as president. It will be a bittersweet moment for two leaders who have come to rely on each other, even after Mr. Obama\u2019s strong criticism of Germany\u2019s unyielding stance on the euro, austerity and the Greek debt crisis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Germany\u2019s strength also has fissures. Some 27 years after the Berlin Wall fell, Europe\u2019s No. 1 economy shirks any real fundamental changes. It remains dependent on American military and intelligence for its security, although it is ramping up intelligence spending. Its exporters benefit hugely from the euro single currency, but the government keeps postponing the politically costly task of strengthening the eurozone.\n\nIn the past two years, Ms. Merkel has been firm in dealing with Russia, keeping Europe united on sanctions of the Kremlin for its seizure of Crimea and fighting in east Ukraine. But Ms. Merkel\u2019s admission of hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim refugees last year weakened her at home and soured relations with Central and Eastern European countries that felt ignored.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s election may remove some of those difficulties. His pay-as-you-go approach to NATO, for instance, could prompt the Central and Eastern Europeans to turn toward the European Union, and Germany, as a more reliable source of protection.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank based in London, said it could \u201ccreate a kind of race to Washington, where everybody tries to do their own deals\u201d with the deal-making Mr. Trump.\n\nThe British will be at the head of the queue, he said \u2014 something apparently confirmed by the president-elect\u2019s immediate invitation to Prime Minister Theresa May to visit Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s style of leadership \u2014 undramatic, which is how many voters here like it \u2014 may not cut much ice with Mr. Trump, the building magnate and reality TV star, who loves the glamour that Ms. Merkel shuns. During the campaign, he fiercely attacked her admission of migrants.\n\nYet Ms. Merkel has shown flair in dealing with powerful men, reaching a much-criticized and fragile pact with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to stop Middle Eastern refugees from reaching Europe, and negotiating with Mr. Putin.\n\nAnd she may be able to use Mr. Trump\u2019s victory to her own electoral advantage.\n\n\u201cI was really impressed by her statement, especially her appeal below the surface\u201d to Mr. Trump to behave properly, said Daniel Mock, 23, an engineering student at Technical University of Berlin. \u201cIt could stand her in a better light.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Vincent Szlang, 21, and Vincent Frebel, 23, both economics students, went against the generally critical German view of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe election was a repudiation of two different lifestyles: first the old liberalism and second the attempt to preserve order through pragmatism,\u201d Mr. Szlang said.\n\nMr. Frebel saw the chance of better relations with Russia and said Mrs. Clinton would have been harsher on Germany than Mr. Trump.\n\nSuch remarks underpin concerns among older generations that the lessons of Nazism and Communism are not necessarily learned, and that Germans old and young share Mr. Trump\u2019s admiration for the leader of near-neighbor Russia.\n\nBerlin\u2019s B.Z. tabloid reflected the shift since the fall of the wall. Back then, in an iconic headline, it proclaimed: \u201cBerlin is again Berlin!\u201d\n\nTwenty-seven years later, it pronounced the election of Mr. Trump \u201cthe night the West died.\u201d"}
