{"title": "Catalonia Goes Own Way From President Artur Mas", "authors": ["Raphael Minder"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/world/europe/catalonia-goes-own-way-from-president-artur-mas.html", "body": "In the short term, the Catalan vote may give Mr. Rajoy unexpected breathing space, if it blunts Mr. Mas\u2019s momentum and tangles him in the messy internal politics of Catalonia, where Mr. Mas will most likely have to negotiate with lawmakers who share his separatist ambitions but not his social and economic agenda.\n\nBut the sense of Schadenfreude that surrounded Mr. Mas after the vote might soon make way for fresh worries over the future of Catalonia, which accounts for almost a fifth of Spain\u2019s economic output.\n\nOverall, separatist parties won 74 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament on Sunday. Of that total, however, Mr. Mas and his Converg\u00e8ncia i Uni\u00f3 party only collected 50 seats, down from the 62 seats that the party won two years ago.\n\nThe loss of support on Sunday for Mr. Mas showed that Catalonia \u201ccannot be ruled by a lone ranger,\u201d said Alfred Bosch, who is the leader in the Spanish Parliament of the left-leaning Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya party, or E.R.C. which has long pushed for independence. The party came in second on Sunday, doubling its parliamentary representation in Catalonia, from 10 to 21 seats.\n\nMr. Bosch said that E.R.C. could still offer support to Mr. Mas, but without joining his government and as part of a \u201cplural project\u201d toward Catalan sovereignty. He warned that this meant Mr. Mas would not only have to call the promised referendum on independence, despite Madrid\u2019s opposition, but also stop making budget cuts in sensitive areas like health and education.\n\nAgreeing to such fiscal red lines, however, could make it harder for Mr. Mas to meet budget deficit targets set by Madrid, as well as reduce a Catalan debt pile that is by far the largest in the country \u2014 about \u20ac42 billion, or $54.4 billion, out of a total of \u20ac140 billion for Spain\u2019s 17 regions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The vote also followed a huge pro-independence rally in Barcelona on Sept. 11., which highlighted longstanding resentment toward Madrid in Catalonia, which has its own language and culture.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t regret holding this election because we needed to clarify the Catalan landscape,\u201d Mr. Mas said at a news conference Monday.\n\nFar from clarity, however, he called the outcome \u201cboth clearer and more complicated,\u201d given that a majority of voters endorsed separatist politicians but also decided that his own party would not govern alone.\n\nStill, Mr. Mas said his referendum project remained on track: \u201cWe maintain the same principles that we defended a week ago.\u201d\n\nSalvador Garc\u00eda Ruiz, one of the founders of Collectiu Emma, an association promoting Catalan interests, said: \u201cMr. Rajoy is still facing a clear separatist challenge, but it now comes from a Catalan leader who first has to form the kind of coalition with a left-wing party that has historically not been a success.\u201d"}
