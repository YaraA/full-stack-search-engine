Kathleen Lynch, a junior health minister, said medical professionals needed guidelines to deal with such circumstances.\n\nIn a statement, the hospital said it would cooperate fully with any inquest but that it had not started its own review because it wanted to consult the woman\u2019s family first.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Halappanavar told the newspaper that he still could not believe his wife was dead. \u201cI was with her those four days in intensive care,\u201d he said. \u201cThey kept telling me: \u2018She\u2019s young. She\u2019ll get over it.\u2019 But things never changed; they only got worse. She was so full of life. She loved kids.\n\n\u201cIt was all in their hands, and they just let her go. How can you let a young woman go to save a baby who will die anyway?\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Halappanavar said he saw no use in being angry. \u201cI\u2019ve lost her,\u201d he said. \u201cI am talking about this because it shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During a miscarriage, the cervix is opened, exposing the woman to infection, and the longer the miscarriage persists, the greater the risk, said a prominent medical commentator here, Dr. Muiris Houston. While Dr. Halappanavar\u2019s death was \u201con the rare end of the spectrum,\u201d and the facts surrounding the case are not all known, Dr. Houston said, she \u201cundoubtedly needed to go to theater,\u201d meaning to surgery.\n\n\u201cIf she had gone to theater earlier she might still have died, but perhaps not,\u201d he said. \u201cMedicine is now increasingly driven by guidelines, and the question must be, \u2018Did the hospital have protocols in place when a woman presented with such a condition?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe legal issues are, if anything, more clouded. In 1992, the Irish Supreme Court ruled that abortion was permissible in cases where there was a \u201creal and substantial risk\u201d to the life of a pregnant woman \u2014 including the possibility of suicide. But 20 years later, the Irish government has still not passed a law to this effect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2010, the European Court of Human Rights found that Ireland was in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to provide an accessible and effective procedure to ascertain whether a woman qualified for a legal abortion.\n\nIn response, the current coalition government commissioned a report from an expert group on the issue. It was initially expected in July, but was then postponed until September \u2014 a deadline also missed. Given the divisiveness of the abortion issue in Ireland, which has prompted two bitterly fought referendums, successive governments have avoided passing any legislation.\n\nThe report was eventually delivered Tuesday night, hours before news broke of Dr. Halappanavar\u2019s death. The government warned people not to link the two, but inevitably the death has led to calls for urgent reform."}
