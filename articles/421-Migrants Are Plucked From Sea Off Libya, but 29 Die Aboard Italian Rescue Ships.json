If larger navy ships like those used in the Mare Nostrum program had been involved in the latest rescue, he said, they might have afforded more room and greater protection from the elements for the rescued migrants.\n\n\u201cYou could argue that this is the first consequence of the absence of Mare Nostrum,\u201d he said.

But the rescue ships had very limited space below, and most of the migrants had to remain huddled on deck, wrapped in blankets, as the rescue vessels made their way back to Lampedusa. Commander Marini said each vessel had a doctor and a nurse on board who tried to treat the most weakened people, even as some began to succumb.\n\nEarly reports said that seven of the 29 migrants who died did so before the coast guard reached the scene, but late on Monday a commander confirmed that all 29 were still alive when they were transferred to rescue vessels.\n\n\u201cThese people died because of the cold,\u201d Giusi Nicolini, the mayor of Lampedusa, said in an interview on the Italian news channel Sky TG24. \u201cHad they been transported on the large ships of Mare Nostrum, they would be alive.\u201d", "summary": "Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, suggested that the change might have played a tragic role in the events on Monday.Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.Commander Marini said each vessel had a doctor and a nurse on board who tried to treat the most weakened people, even as some began to succumb.Early reports said that seven of the 29 migrants who died did so before the coast guard reached the scene, but late on Monday a commander confirmed that all 29 were still alive when they were transferred to rescue vessels.\u201cThese people died because of the cold,\u201d Giusi Nicolini, the mayor of Lampedusa, said in an interview on the Italian news channel Sky TG24."}
