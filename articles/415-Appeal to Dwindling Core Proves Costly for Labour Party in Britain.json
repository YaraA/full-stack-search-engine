{"title": "Appeal to Dwindling Core Proves Costly for Labour Party in Britain", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger", "Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/world/europe/appeal-to-dwindling-core-proves-costly-for-labour-party-in-britain.html", "body": "But Mr. Miliband\u2019s campaign was also a challenge \u2014 and a rebuff \u2014 to the \u201cNew Labour\u201d strategy of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who won three elections by downplaying socialism, reaching for the center and convincing business that Labour was its friend.\n\nIn the end, the Conservatives appeared to succeed in much of Britain with their argument that Labour under Mr. Miliband could not be trusted with the economy, especially if prodded by the Scottish National Party.\n\nBut in the face of economic anxiety and the nationalist revolution in Scotland, which destroyed Labour\u2019s inbuilt demographic advantage in a first past the post system that rewards regional concentrations of support, the core strategy backfired badly. Labour won 41 of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats in Parliament in 2010. On Thursday, it won one, and it won very few seats from the Conservatives in England.\n\nAlan Johnson, a former home secretary for Labour, said on Saturday that the party needed \u201ca proper rethink.\u201d\n\nThe problem was not Mr. Miliband\u2019s personality but policy, \u201cthe issue of aspiration in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cWe can no longer relate to them as a party of aspiration. And that was one of the big successes that won us three elections.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Labour is deeper than just its abandoning the middle ground, said Steven Fielding, professor of political history at Nottingham University. \u201cOn one level they are seen as too left-wing in England and too right-wing in Scotland, but actually it is about the relationship the party had with the electorate in both countries,\u201d he said.\n\nLabour \u201cfaces a basic existential crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most basic problem is that the party has to reconnect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe left \u201chas failed to capitalize on the crisis of 2008,\u201d said Tony Travers, a political scientist at the London School of Economics.\n\n\u201cThe voters here decided they trusted the center-right more than Labour anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will vote to get rid of a government if the alternative is credible and competent, and they looked at Labour and said, \u2018No thanks.\u2019 \u201d\n\nVideo\n\nBritish elections \u201care still fought on the center ground,\u201d Mr. Travers said. \u201cThe more Labour drifts from the center the more it hurts, and they may not like it, but Britain is a very moderate country that signed up to Anglo-Saxon capitalism, and risks outside the mainstream worried voters.\u201d\n\nMr. Blair won three elections, starting 1997, but inside the party there remained a sharp battle between the \u201cBlairites,\u201d who pushed outreach to business and the middle class, and the \u201cBrownites,\u201d who supported Gordon Brown, a defender of traditional policies. Mr. Brown succeeded Mr. Blair as prime minister.\n\nMr. Brown lost the 2010 elections, but because Mr. Cameron did not quite win it, having to go into a coalition with the centrist Liberal Democrats, the Brownites kept control of the party.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The fight was close and Freudian, but while Labour members of Parliament backed David, the trade unions pushed Ed narrowly into the leadership.\n\nThe former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, reportedly quoting a trade-union ally, famously said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got our party back.\u201d Ed Miliband gave that traditional socialism a modern gloss, but he sometimes seemed less than comfortable dealing with issues like nurturing the economic recovery, shrinking the budget deficit, appealing to business and managing, as opposed to funding, the national health service.\n\nIn some sense, he was seen as running against Mr. Blair as much as Mr. Cameron. As Mr. Johnson said, if Labour was \u201csuggesting that we failed in our 13 years in government it\u2019s not going to do us much good.\u201d\n\nMark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that Labour must avoid a simple rerun of the old debate. A core strategy will no longer work since the electoral system no longer favors Labour, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSo will there be another debate about how to win back lost voters?\u201d he said. \u201cOr about ideas, values and ideologies? After 2010 the argument was more tactical, but the result was a miserable 30.4 percent of the vote.\u201d\n\nThese elections were more about identity than a left-right battle, Mr. Leonard said, not only in Scotland but in England, too, when Mr. Cameron used the prospect of a Labour government propped up by Scottish separatists to appeal to English nationalism. Labour failed to win many Conservative seats in England, taking gains there from left-leaning Liberal Democrats.\n\nLabour this time got \u201csqueezed by two nationalisms,\u201d as Labour grandee and former strategist Peter Mandelson said, by the Scottish National Party and by English nationalism, not just by the Conservatives but in the form of a strong U.K. Independence Party vote in northern England. The anti-immigration, anti-European Union UKIP hurt the Conservatives in the south, but it had a big impact among Labour voters in the north, and was the main reason that Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, lost his seat in Leeds to the Tories.\n\nLabour needs to respond to members\u2019 unease about immigration and the European Union, which requires freedom of movement and labor among its member states. On these issues, this time, Labour had little to say, acknowledging Blair-era laxness but simply arguing that European Union membership was a good thing and there had to be more control over immigration, without specifying how.\n\nThe immediate focus was on who might replace Mr. Miliband as party leader.\n\nBut the personalities are not necessarily the main issue for Labour. The problem is the old one \u2014 how to reach out past its core constituencies, about a third or so of voters, to the aspirational center that wants social justice and personal success. That center may dislike the Conservative Party as a brand for the careless southeastern elite, but the results of successive elections suggests that it does not hate wealth, and it does not believe that the Conservatives are going to \u201cdestroy\u201d the National Health Service.\n\n\u201cWe failed to offer a compelling vision of the future which married a social democratic future to the personal aspirations of voters,\u201d one possible new leader, Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, told the BBC.\n\nLast December, Mr. Blair said presciently this election risked becoming one in which a \u201ctraditional left-wing party competes with a traditional right-wing party, with the traditional result.\u201d\n\nAsked by The Economist magazine if he meant that the Conservatives would win the general election in those circumstances, Mr. Blair replied: \u201cYes, that is what happens.\u201d", "summary": "In the end, the Conservatives appeared to succeed in much of Britain with their argument that Labour under Mr. Miliband could not be trusted with the economy, especially if prodded by the Scottish National Party.But in the face of economic anxiety and the nationalist revolution in Scotland, which destroyed Labour\u2019s inbuilt demographic advantage in a first past the post system that rewards regional concentrations of support, the core strategy backfired badly.Mr. Blair won three elections, starting 1997, but inside the party there remained a sharp battle between the \u201cBlairites,\u201d who pushed outreach to business and the middle class, and the \u201cBrownites,\u201d who supported Gordon Brown, a defender of traditional policies.The former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, reportedly quoting a trade-union ally, famously said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got our party back.\u201d Ed Miliband gave that traditional socialism a modern gloss, but he sometimes seemed less than comfortable dealing with issues like nurturing the economic recovery, shrinking the budget deficit, appealing to business and managing, as opposed to funding, the national health service.These elections were more about identity than a left-right battle, Mr. Leonard said, not only in Scotland but in England, too, when Mr. Cameron used the prospect of a Labour government propped up by Scottish separatists to appeal to English nationalism."}
