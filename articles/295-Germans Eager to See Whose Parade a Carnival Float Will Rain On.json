Proud to show off his creations at his cavernous, drafty workshop, he steadfastly refused to say what stands inside the giant tent that dominates the courtyard where the secret \u201cpolitical\u201d floats are hidden.\n\nCarnival here hardly shares the fame of the colorful, dancing celebrations in Rio de Janeiro, or of Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Outside Germany, it is something of a secret that the cities and towns in the Rhine river valley go wild, too.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut for five days starting on Thursday, up to one million people will swill beer and take to the streets here, as well as in Cologne and Mainz. In the mileslong parades and costumed ceremonies, the political floats take pride of place.\n\nMr. Tilly is steeped in a European tradition that made jesters, or fools, the kings during Carnivals. From the Saturnalia of the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages, the Continent celebrated what Mr. Tilly called \u201cthe magical time\u201d when winter nears, then spring and summer await.\n\n\u201cIn Carnival, the people said, \u2018This is our time. We have the power,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Tilly said. \u201cAnd a bit of that remains,\u201d he added, calling Carnival \u201cthe time of passions, when taboos do not exist.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, they do, particularly in a shrinking world where sensibilities \u2014 and sensitivities \u2014 bump up against each other with sometimes dangerous consequences.\n\nMr. Tilly is certainly no stranger to the perils of satire, an art he has practiced for over 30 years. \u201cI came when I was 20,\u201d he said, looking around his workshop, \u201cand somehow I never left.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast year, the parade occurred weeks after the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo, a publication Mr. Tilly said he has read all his adult life. His float depicted a terrorist lunging with a bloody sword at a decapitated person running with a copy of Charlie Hebdo. Instead of blood pouring from his head, there is a thought bubble with the words, \u201cYou cannot kill satire!\u201d\n\nThe float was considered daring \u2014 enabling Mr. Tilly, and his many backers here, to lord it over Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s archrival in all things Carnival, and which declined to address the same delicate subject.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis year, too, the float gave D\u00fcsseldorf an advantage. The ruling Carnival Committee had already tightened security against possible trouble stirred by the Charlie Hebdo float.\n\nIn Cologne, by contrast, local grandees have rallied around their city since the shock of the New Year\u2019s Eve assaults and plan to triple or even quadruple the police presence when the celebrations peak next week on Rose Monday.\n\nCologne \u201cwas hit very, very hard\u201d by the New Year\u2019s violence, admitted Sigrid Krebs of that city\u2019s Carnival committee, which oversees 115 of perhaps 200 Carnival associations there.\n\nUp and down the Rhine, cities and towns are putting a premium on preventing a repeat of New Year\u2019s Eve, and on explaining to newcomers, especially those from the Muslim world, that the partying and lewdness are innocent and \u2014 this is Germany, after all \u2014 have quite a few rules.\n\nCarnival organizers are almost competing in issuing multilingual explainers of the rituals. The flier in Bonn, for example, relays in Arabic, English, French, Albanian, Kurdish, Persian, Dari and Tigrinya that \u201cbuetzen\u201d means a kiss on the cheek, and that sexual approaches are forbidden unless consensual: \u201cNo means No!\u201d\n\nIn his workshop, Mr. Tilly and his team tend to this year\u2019s creations. They make dozens of floats for the parade each year, including five or six political ones. All are destroyed after the parade, however, so he displays numerous photos to show off past works.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe pokes fun at United States presidents, German chancellors, Mr. Putin and Islamic State terrorism. He does not shun crudeness: A creation from 2003 has Angela Merkel, not yet chancellor of Germany, emerging from the rear end of Uncle Sam.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Many people from that time have moved away, he noted, but return for Carnival as one might for Christmas.\n\nHis core friends always dress up \u2014 this year, as flight attendants, an example of cross-dressing common in Carnival \u2014 \u201cso that,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t take yourself too seriously.\u201d\n\nJanine Stemmer, the rare female president of a D\u00fcsseldorf Carnival association (officially, there are 76 groups), takes Carnival so seriously that she even married the man she met at Carnival 2010, where they were named the \u201cprincely pair,\u201d on Nov. 11, 2011.\n\nMs. Stemmer, 43, has been involved in Carnival her whole life: In 1968, her grandfather founded the association she now leads. Not even the heavy rain forecast for this weekend could lessen her excitement to ride a float created by Mr. Tilly on Rose Monday.\n\nAsked about the effect of the attacks in Cologne, however, she grew pensive. Luckily, she said after a pause, D\u00fcsseldorf has Mr. Tilly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe feels exactly what works, and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said. Whether or not he depicts the assaults in Cologne, \u201cWe are simply proud to have such a great artist.\u201d", "summary": "Proud to show off his creations at his cavernous, drafty workshop, he steadfastly refused to say what stands inside the giant tent that dominates the courtyard where the secret \u201cpolitical\u201d floats are hidden.
