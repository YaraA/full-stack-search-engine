I would reassure those markets and investors that Britain\u2019s economy is fundamentally strong.\n\nAnd I would also reassure Brits living in European countries, and European citizens living here, that there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances. There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold.\n\nWe must now prepare for a negotiation with the European Union. This will need to involve the full engagement of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to ensure that the interests of all parts of our United Kingdom are protected and advanced.\n\nBut above all this will require strong, determined and committed leadership.\n\nI am very proud and very honored to have been prime minister of this country for six years.\n\nI believe we have made great steps, with more people in work than ever before in our history, with reforms to welfare and education, increasing people\u2019s life chances, building a bigger and stronger society, keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world, and enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality.\n\nBut above all restoring Britain\u2019s economic strength, and I am grateful to everyone who has helped to make that happen.\n\nI have also always believed that we have to confront big decisions \u2014 not duck them.\n\nThat\u2019s why we delivered the first coalition government in 70 years to bring our economy back from the brink. It\u2019s why we delivered a fair, legal and decisive referendum in Scotland. And why I made the pledge to renegotiate Britain\u2019s position in the European Union and hold a referendum on our membership, and have carried those things out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI fought this campaign in the only way I know how \u2014 which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel \u2014 head, heart and soul.\n\nI held nothing back.\n\nI was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union, and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone \u2014 not the future of any single politician, including myself.\n\nBut the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.\n\nI will do everything I can as prime minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The cabinet will meet on Monday.\n\nThe governor of the Bank of England is making a statement about the steps that the bank and the Treasury are taking to reassure financial markets. We will also continue taking forward the important legislation that we set before Parliament in the Queen\u2019s Speech. And I have spoken to Her Majesty, the Queen, this morning to advise her of the steps that I am taking.\n\nA negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new prime minister, and I think it is right that this new prime minister takes the decision about when to trigger Article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the E.U.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI will attend the European Council next week to explain the decision the British people have taken and my own decision.\n\nThe British people have made a choice. That not only needs to be respected \u2014 but those on the losing side of the argument, myself included, should help to make it work.\n\nBritain is a special country.\n\nWe have so many great advantages.\n\nA parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate.\n\nA great trading nation, with our science and arts, our engineering and our creativity respected the world over.\n\nAnd while we are not perfect, I do believe we can be a model of a multiracial, multifaith democracy, where people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest that their talent allows.\n\nAlthough leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths.\n\nI have said before that Britain can survive outside the European Union, and indeed that we could find a way.\n\nNow the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way.\n\nAnd I will do everything I can to help.\n\nI love this country \u2014 and I feel honored to have served it.\n\nAnd I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed."}
