{"title": "Right-Wing Party Roars Back in Polish Elections", "authors": ["Rick Lyman"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/poland-parliamentary-elections.html", "body": "Mr. Kaczynski, a former prime minister and the twin brother of President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a 2010 plane crash, did not run as the party\u2019s candidate for prime minister. Although he is expected to wield power behind the scenes \u2014 it was he who was the chief speaker at Sunday\u2019s victory celebration \u2014 the prime ministership will go to another party veteran, Beata Szydlo.\n\nA somber Civic Platform conceded defeat and touted its accomplishments.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t wasted these eight years,\u201d said Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz. \u201cPoland today is a country which develops economically with single-digit unemployment. This is the state we\u2019re leaving Poland to those who won the election.\u201d\n\nIn an especially telling result, highlighting how Poland was joining many regional neighbors in a shift to the right, none of the country\u2019s left-wing or social democratic parties appeared to have qualified for seats in Parliament for the first time in Poland\u2019s post-communist history.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cLet us not lose spirit,\u201d said Barbara Nowacka, head of the Left Alliance. \u201cAlthough society tell us, \u2018No, we want the right,\u2019 we do know that the time for the left will come and then we will be waiting, strong and determined, with our heads high.\u201d\n\nWith 38 million residents, Poland is both the largest and the most economically vibrant nation in Eastern Europe and has emerged in recent years as a regional leader. Still, disenchanted voters have proved increasingly tired of hearing about a thriving economy that they feel has left too many behind and that still lags far behind those of more prosperous, Western European nations.\n\nUnder Poland\u2019s complex voting rules, a party can take control of the government without the need for a coalition partner even if it draws less than 40 percent of the vote, depending on how many of the smaller parties cross the 5 percent threshold required to earn seats in the new Parliament.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Only then will it become clear whether Law and Justice can form a government on its own, or will need to seek a coalition partner.\n\nCivic Platform has been under a cloud since last summer, when several government officials were caught making profane and impolitic comments on illegal wiretaps. It suffered a further blow when its leader, Donald Tusk, resigned as prime minister last year to become president of the European Council in Brussels.\n\n\u201cThe carnival that is the election is over,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski told Law and Justice supporters on Sunday. \u201cNow it is time for real work. We must remember about modesty, which binds us.\u201d", "summary": "Although he is expected to wield power behind the scenes \u2014 it was he who was the chief speaker at Sunday\u2019s victory celebration \u2014 the prime ministership will go to another party veteran, Beata Szydlo.
