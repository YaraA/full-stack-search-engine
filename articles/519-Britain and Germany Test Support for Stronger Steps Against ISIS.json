The French president said he had no role in Syria\u2019s future, while Mr. Putin said he and his army were an important ally in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nEach of France\u2019s allies remains hesitant to enter the messy Syrian conflict, the dangers of which became apparent this week when Turkish forces shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian border. American officials have indicated that they would like European nations to do more in the fight, and that differences with Russia over Mr. Assad remain a barrier to a broad alliance.\n\nBut the Paris attacks, and Mr. Hollande\u2019s diplomatic appeals, now seem to be chipping away at some of the reluctance in Europe.\n\nIn Germany, the defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, announced on Wednesday that up to 650 German soldiers would go to Mali to free up French forces from there, and that their current training and equipping of Kurdish pesh merga forces in northern Iraq would be expanded when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in January.\n\nMr. Cameron now believes that since the Paris attacks he can win approval to ratchet up British military engagement, but also knows that many lawmakers remain skeptical about an extended bombing campaign. The attack in Paris \u201ccould have been in London. If ISIL had their way, it would be in London,\u201d Mr. Cameron told Parliament.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Because of that rebuff, Mr. Cameron will not risk another vote until he is sure he will win. His decision will come down to parliamentary arithmetic. British politicians know that voters are cautious about military entanglements in the Middle East because of the legacy of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nYet Mr. Cameron\u2019s supporters point out that in 2013, the proposal rejected by British lawmakers was to attack the forces of the Syrian president, Mr. Assad.\n\nNow the question is whether to attack the Islamic State, and Mr. Cameron has long argued that it makes little sense to limit attacks to Iraq when the group does not recognize the frontier.\n\nOn Thursday he argued that bombing in Syria was legally justified as self-defense, and suggested that it would not increase the risk of retaliatory terror attacks significantly, since Britain \u201cis already in the top tier of countries that ISIL is targeting.\u201d\n\nThough some experts doubt that British involvement would matter much militarily, Mr. Cameron argued that Britain could deploy Brimstone \u2014 a precision missile system which, he said, \u201ceven the Americans do not have\u201d \u2014 as well as Raptor, a reconnaissance airborne pod for Tornado aircraft.\n\nSince the 2013 vote, the composition of the British Parliament has altered after a general election in May in which Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party won a full majority, allowing it to govern without its former coalition ally, the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party has also changed leaders, electing Jeremy Corbyn, a left-wing politician who opposes airstrikes in Syria. He acknowledged the threat to Britain from the Islamic State, but on Thursday wrote in a letter to his lawmakers that Mr. Cameron had not set out a coherent strategy or explained what \u201ccredible and acceptable ground forces\u201d could retake and hold territory from the group.", "summary": "On Thursday he argued that bombing in Syria was legally justified as self-defense, and suggested that it would not increase the risk of retaliatory terror attacks significantly, since Britain \u201cis already in the top tier of countries that ISIL is targeting.\u201d Though some experts doubt that British involvement would matter much militarily, Mr. Cameron argued that Britain could deploy Brimstone \u2014 a precision missile system which, he said, \u201ceven the Americans do not have\u201d \u2014 as well as Raptor, a reconnaissance airborne pod for Tornado aircraft.
