The result has been to fuel a sense among many Muslims that France \u2014 which celebrates Christian holidays in public schools \u2014 is engaging in a form of state racism.\n\nThe ban, some critics argue, also plays into the hands of Islamists, who are eager to drive a deeper wedge between Muslims and non-Muslims in the West.\n\nSo far, France has passed two laws, one in 2004 banning veils in public elementary and secondary schools, and another, enacted in 2011, banning full face veils, which are worn by only a tiny portion of the population.\n\nBut observant Muslim women in France, whose head coverings can vary from head scarves tied loosely under the chin to tightly fitted caps and wimple-like scarves that hide every strand of hair, say the constant talk of new laws has made them targets of abuse, from being spat at to having their veils pulled or being pushed when they walk on the streets.\n\nIn some towns, mothers wearing head scarves have been prevented from picking up their children from school or from chaperoning class outings. One major discount store has been accused of routinely searching veiled customers.\n\nSome women have even been violently attacked. In Toulouse recently, a pregnant mother wearing a head scarf had to be hospitalized after being beaten on the street by a young man who called her a \u201cdirty Muslim.\u201d\n\nStatistics collected by the National Observatory Against Islamophobia, a watchdog group, show that in the last two years 80 percent of the anti-Muslim acts involving violence and assault were directed at women, most of them veiled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat is revolting is that such things take place in broad daylight and with the total indifference of the people around,\u201d said Abdallah Zekri, the group\u2019s president.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrance, where Muslims make up an estimated 8 percent of the population, has long displayed discomfort with Muslim women who cover their heads, behavior that is standard in the Muslim world and is in keeping with the Quran\u2019s teachings on modesty.\n\nBut in recent years, French leaders appear ever more focused on banning veils. They have been driven by a number of factors, including the rise of a far-right movement that openly deplores what it calls the Islamization of France and the reality that homegrown Muslim extremists have carried out two of the worst attacks within France, including the shootings at the headquarters of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January.\n\nMainstream politicians on the right, including former President Nicolas Sarkozy, are calling for veiled women to be barred from universities. Others in Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s party want to see women who cover their faces in public brought up on felony charges. On the left, a small party has pushed for a law stopping veiled women from working in day care centers with government contracts.\n\nEven in President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist government, Pascale Boistard, the junior minister for women\u2019s rights, said in January that she was \u201cnot sure that the veil had a place at the university level.\u201d\n\nNils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe\u2019s commissioner for human rights, who noted the high number of attacks on veiled women as an area of particular concern in his 2014 report on France, is critical of what he called the country\u2019s \u201cpreoccupation\u201d with Muslim women\u2019s attire.\n\n\u201cIt only highlights and stigmatizes them,\u201d he said.\n\nMany French officials defend the anti-veil laws. The ban on full face veils is needed for security reasons, they say, noting that Belgium has a similar ban, and the Netherlands is considering one. They say the ban in schools, prompted by an incident in 1989 when three young girls were sent home from public school for refusing to remove their head scarves, is in pursuit of la\u00efcit\u00e9. (Skullcaps and large crosses and other ostentatious religious signs were banned too, they point out.)\n\nThe concept of la\u00efcit\u00e9 was developed during the French Revolution, and was intended to limit the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in the government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore recently, however, experts say it has become the rallying cry of the right, which has redefined it as a weapon to defend the traditions of French life against what many see as the frightening influence of a growing Muslim population.\n\nYet, even as there are more and more calls for restrictions on the veil, France\u2019s most recent law, which bars veils that cover the face, has proved problematic. Some question why it ever came into being as experts believe that only a tiny fraction of French Muslims dress that way \u2014 no more than 2,000 and perhaps as few as 500, many of them converts.\n\nIn the three years since the law took effect, only about 1,000 fines, which can go as high as 150 euros, have been issued. Several women, it seems, have enjoyed goading the police. One woman received more than 80 fines. Few paid themselves. A wealthy Algerian businessman created a fund to pay for any ticket issued.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers say that some Frenchwomen who are committed to being fully veiled have become shut-ins, afraid to leave their homes.\n\n\u201cIt is the worst-case scenario,\u201d said Naima Bouteldja, who wrote two reports on the subject for the nonprofit Open Society Foundations, which supports human rights. \u201cThey are not liberated, they are imprisoned by this law.\u201d\n\nMany French Muslims scoff at the law, saying wealthy tourists from the Middle East wearing full face veils and carrying expensive handbags are able to stroll down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es or vacation on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur without ever being ticketed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Nor can they help in holiday parties for the children, many of which continue to be linked to Christian celebrations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOuassila Arab, 34, one mother barred from such activities, said the first veiled mother who was told she could not come on school property had been at work on the class Christmas party. The case is still making its way through the courts.\n\n\u201cFrance wanted us when they needed us,\u201d said Ms. Arab, who grew up in M\u00e9ru after her father came from Algeria to help build roads. \u201cNow they are not so interested.\u201d\n\nMs. Arab said she started covering her hair in her 20s as her faith grew. But, like many veiled women, she said it was a decision that came with a price. She has had trouble finding work and now commutes into Paris \u2014 about an hour \u2014 to work as a secretary in a Muslim-owned construction company.\n\nVeiled woman \u2014 like anyone else wearing obvious signs of religious affiliation \u2014 are officially barred from working in the public sector because of the original la\u00efcit\u00e9 laws. There is little doubt that, in practice, this restriction has broader impact on Muslim women who cover their heads.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, a group of young Muslim women who attend a monthly meeting to discuss religion and morality gathered to discuss the veil in an apartment in Montreuil, a suburb of Paris. In their private lives, they all wore the veil, though almost all of them said they felt obliged to take it off for work, some making the changeover in their cars.\n\nAmong them were women who work in finance and marketing, a pharmacist, an optician and a nutritionist. Many said that they had tried to find employment with their veils, but that employers had balked when they saw them in person.\n\nA 33-year-old engineer from another Paris suburb said that for years she did not have the courage to cover her hair at work, but decided after 10 years in a large construction company to try.\n\nShe found it \u201cvery, very hard,\u201d she said.\n\nHer boss was supportive, she said, but emphasized that she needed to wear \u201cpretty\u201d and \u201ccolorful\u201d veils that did not cover her neck. Some of her co-workers, however, just stopped speaking to her. And some went to her bosses saying that she should not be allowed to \u201crepresent the company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI am pretty sure they just wanted me fired,\u201d she said.\n\nDefending his ban on veiled women at the temporary beach, Richard Trinquier, the mayor of Wissous, told a court that he was protecting France\u2019s commitment to secularism.\n\nAccording to newspaper accounts, the mayor, a member of Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s center-right U.M.P. party, said that the increasing presence of religious symbols in public was becoming \u201can obstacle to living together.\u201d Mr. Trinquier declined to be interviewed.\n\nThe judge in the Wissous case disagreed and the beach was eventually opened to Mrs. Layouni. But the event left her traumatized and split this tidy village of modest homes as friends lined up on one side or the other.\n\n\u201cMy husband said that I lost my inner light,\u201d said Mrs. Layouni, with a sigh. In the aftermath of the ruling, the couple, who owned a tearoom in Wissous, also saw their business fall off. They closed it this year, and moved to a neighboring town.", "summary": "Statistics collected by the National Observatory Against Islamophobia, a watchdog group, show that in the last two years 80 percent of the anti-Muslim acts involving violence and assault were directed at women, most of them veiled.
