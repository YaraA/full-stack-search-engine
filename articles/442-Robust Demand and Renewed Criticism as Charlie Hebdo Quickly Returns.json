The brothers who targeted the weekly, Sa\u00efd and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, said they had done so to avenge insults to Muhammad by the paper.\n\nIn Geneva, while waiting for a meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, explained the Islamic Republic\u2019s criticism of the latest issue. \u201cWe believe that sanctities need to be respected, and unless we learn to respect one another, it will be very difficult in a world of different views and different cultures and civilizations,\u201d Mr. Zarif said.\n\nMr. Kerry is to travel to Paris on Friday to meet with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in a belated diplomatic effort to offset the absence of a high-ranking American figure during Sunday\u2019s mass rally, in which more than 40 other foreign leaders participated.\n\nIn Turkey, which is predominantly Muslim, a secular newspaper, Cumhuriyet, said Wednesday that the police had checked the paper\u2019s content after it decided to print some of the caricatures from the new issue. The police allowed the newspaper to be distributed after finding that it had not reprinted the contentious cover showing Muhammad. Later in the day, however, a Turkish court ordered the country\u2019s telecommunications authority to block access to web pages that showed the cover, the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency said.\n\nCharlie Hebdo was snapped up by people who appeared motivated by a mix of curiosity, a sense of history and a desire to show solidarity with the paper. Some sellers imposed a limit of one copy per person, as buyers who did not usually read the paper bought copies as souvenirs. Commuters said lines of up to 80 people snaked around newsstands.\n\nBut while a peaceful atmosphere endured, many Muslims said they felt insulted, while others argued that the issue was needlessly provocative.\n\n\u201cInsulting the prophet can never be regarded within the context of media freedom,\u201d Ercan Ezgin, a Turkish lawyer who filed a complaint that prompted the ruling on the web pages, told the CNN Turk channel. \u201cThis cartoon bears the danger of deeply provoking billions of Muslims. It should never be acceptable to depict our prophet in such a cartoon, poking fun at him, showing him as if he\u2019s shedding tears.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have limitless freedom of speech, Muslim community has limitless right to protest,\u201d one handwritten sign read outside the offices of Cumhuriyet, a photograph posted on Twitter showed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat sentiment was conveyed by many French Muslims, and some went even further in expressing their contempt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their own country, so they can do what they want, but I was very hurt,\u201d said Rachid Kadmar, 33, a French citizen from Vaulx-en-Velin, a poor suburb of Lyon, referring to the magazine\u2019s editors who had been killed for lampooning Muhammad. \u201cThey deserved murder.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Meryam Boowarmane-Klee, 35, a converted Muslim who attended a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, were more moderate in their views.\n\n\u201cA newspaper doesn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can\u2019t bomb me.\u201d", "summary": "For some Muslims, any depiction of Muhammad is seen as blasphemous, and even some supporters of free speech described Charlie Hebdo\u2019s decision to put a cartoon of the prophet on its first cover since last week\u2019s attack as unnecessarily inflammatory.In Geneva, while waiting for a meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, explained the Islamic Republic\u2019s criticism of the latest issue.Mr. Kerry is to travel to Paris on Friday to meet with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in a belated diplomatic effort to offset the absence of a high-ranking American figure during Sunday\u2019s mass rally, in which more than 40 other foreign leaders participated.Later in the day, however, a Turkish court ordered the country\u2019s telecommunications authority to block access to web pages that showed the cover, the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency said.\u201cInsulting the prophet can never be regarded within the context of media freedom,\u201d Ercan Ezgin, a Turkish lawyer who filed a complaint that prompted the ruling on the web pages, told the CNN Turk channel."}
