Her husband, Rami, was seriously wounded, but he is now in stable condition.\n\n\u201cI received with great sadness the news of the death of Dalia Elyakim in the horrific terror attack in Berlin,\u201d President Reuven Rivlin of Israel said on Thursday, after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the news.\n\nThe couple, in their 60s, had traveled from their home in the central Israeli city of Herzliya. Moshe Egoz, a longtime friend, described Mrs. Elyakim as a \u201cgood soul.\u201d He told Israeli Army Radio that \u201cthey loved to travel, especially around Christmas time.\u201d He said he had been following their trip to Berlin through her posts on Facebook.\n\nAccording to the Facebook page, Mrs. Elyakim was originally from Haifa, attended Galilee High School in Tiberias and studied at Ohalo College, which trains teachers. In August 2009, she posted a series of pictures from Berlin, including shots of the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, remnants of the Berlin Wall and an old Allied checkpoint, although those images evidently came from a previous winter, since some included Christmas trees.\n\nAnother photograph on her page was captioned, \u201cAmazing grapes that grow in my garden.\u201d\n\nMore than 70 years after the Holocaust, Berlin lately has become a magnet for Jews attracted to its cosmopolitan sensibilities, modern conveniences and economic possibilities. Only about 8,000 Jews were left in Berlin after World War II, down from a prewar high of 180,000, but today, some estimate that about 45,000 live in the German capital, as many as a third of them from Israel.\n\nFabrizia Di Lorenzo, an Italian Living in Berlin\n\nPhoto\n\nFabrizia Di Lorenzo, a 31-year-old Italian living in Germany, had been missing since the attack. The Italian foreign minister, Angelino Alfano, confirmed Thursday morning that she had been killed. She was from Sulmona, in the Abruzzo region east of Rome, and had master\u2019s degrees from universities in Bologna and Milan.\n\nAndrea D\u2019Addio, the editor of Berlino Magazine, an online publication aimed at Italian expatriates in the German capital, said that Ms. Di Lorenzo had written for the magazine. \u201cShe loved Germany, and wrote sociopolitical and geopolitical pieces for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. D\u2019Addio said that Ms. Di Lorenzo had studied in Berlin on the Erasmus exchange program of the European Union, and that she had then done an internship at the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Vienna.

She had also posted pictures showing gondolas in Venice and grass fields in the mountains of Abruzzo. Her background profile picture is a bridge in eastern Berlin.

His load: 25 tons of steel beams, destined for a warehouse owned by a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp. He arrived in Berlin early Monday, but the delivery was scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, so he was told to wait.\n\nHe parked on a street next to a canal opposite the warehouse. Around noon, he called Ariel Zurawski, a cousin and the owner of the trucking company, based in the village of Sobiemysl, Poland, near the German border. They discussed whether Mr. Urban could come home sooner. He had been scheduled to continue on to Denmark, and he hoped to be back home by Thursday so that he would have time to buy a present for his wife.\n\nAround 7:30 p.m., when the truck started moving toward the center of Berlin, Mr. Zurawski said he knew something was wrong.\n\n\u201cWe called him \u2018inspector,\u2019 because he was never more than three minutes late,\u201d Mr. Zurawski said. \u201cWe joked that he should work for a courier company. He wouldn\u2019t just take the truck and start driving it after hours.\u201d\n\nMr. Urban had a teenage son. He had worked as a driver for 15 years and lived in Roznowo, a small village in West Pomerania, near the border with Germany.\n\nMr. Urban enjoyed cycling. \u201cHe often took his bike with him when he hit the road, so that he could take it out whenever he had a break,\u201d said Lukasz Wasik, a manager at the trucking company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe talked a lot about his wife and son,\u201d Mr. Wasik said. \u201cHe was proud of his kid and loved talking about his son\u2019s successes at school.\u201d\n\nMr. Urban\u2019s body was found inside the cab of the truck; he had been shot and stabbed. He was 37, and a stocky man \u2014 5-foot-11, 265 pounds \u2014 and Mr. Zurawski and Mr. Wasik said they thought Mr. Urban had probably resisted his attacker.\n\nPatryk Jaki, Poland\u2019s deputy minister of justice and a member of the right-wing government that took power last year, described Mr. Urban as \u201canother victim of a terrible migrant policy of the European elites that have taken in Islamist fighters.\u201d", "summary": "Moshe Egoz, a longtime friend, described Mrs. Elyakim as a \u201cgood soul.\u201d He told Israeli Army Radio that \u201cthey loved to travel, especially around Christmas time.\u201d He said he had been following their trip to Berlin through her posts on Facebook.According to the Facebook page, Mrs. Elyakim was originally from Haifa, attended Galilee High School in Tiberias and studied at Ohalo College, which trains teachers.Relatives of Ms. Di Lorenzo who live in the Boston area told a television station there that she had been deeply committed to international affairs and concerned about the migration crisis.Pictures that she posted online from various sites in Berlin included a rooftop view with the television tower in Alexanderplatz in the background; a sunset near the Parliament, featuring the glass dome over the Reichstag; and the contemporary steel-and-glass architecture at Potsdamer Platz.Patryk Jaki, Poland\u2019s deputy minister of justice and a member of the right-wing government that took power last year, described Mr. Urban as \u201canother victim of a terrible migrant policy of the European elites that have taken in Islamist fighters.\u201d"}
