{"title": "Europe\u2019s Halting Response to Migrant Crisis Draws Criticism as Toll Mounts", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger", "Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/world/europe/europe-migrant-refugee-crisis.html", "body": "\u201cWhile Europe is squabbling, people are dying,\u201d said Alexander Betts, a professor and director of the Refugee Studies Center at Oxford University. \u201cFor the first time in its history, the E.U. is facing a massive influx of refugees from outside the region, and the E.U. asylum and immigration framework is poorly adapted for it.\u201d\n\nFront-line states like Greece, Italy and now Austria and Hungary are \u201coverwhelmed and increasingly unwilling to take more responsibility,\u201d Mr. Betts said. \u201cSome European states are failing to keep to international law, and there needs to be a more equitable sharing of responsibility.\u201d\n\nIn contradiction to the rules of the Dublin Regulation, formerly known as the Dublin Convention, some countries are simply allowing migrants to freely pass through their territory to richer European states without even trying to ascertain whether they are refugees entitled to asylum or economic migrants, who can be deported home.\n\nUnder the convention, the countries where migrants first enter are supposed to screen them to decide who is a legitimate asylum seeker or refugee, but those countries are overwhelmed.\n\nSome countries, like Sweden and Germany, are being generous with their acceptance of refugees, but warn that they cannot be this generous forever. Other countries, like Britain, are strictly applying regulations to dissuade migrants and asylum seekers, while opposing a European Commission proposal in June for mandatory quotas for settlement, to help share the burden.\n\nOther countries, like Slovakia and Poland, have said they want only Christian refugees.\n\nThe question of immigration is a visceral issue in a way the euro is not, dividing European governments from their electorates, member states from one another and the European Union from the values on which it was founded, said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, an analyst with the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris.\n\nMore than 100,000 people arrived in the bloc in July alone, but European leaders \u201chave agreed no coherent response,\u201d he said in a commentary in The Financial Times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe divisions among member states \u201care growing unsustainable,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said, with Germany taking about 40 percent of new asylum seekers, while France is taking only 8 percent and Britain, 4 percent.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of the European Union\u2019s fundamental principles is freedom of travel, especially within the borderless \u201cSchengen area,\u201d which includes much of Continental Europe.\n\nBut that achievement is in danger now, said the Austrian foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, in an interview on Friday, demanding an urgent meeting of heads of state and government.\n\nSchengen is also expected to be a subject of the interior ministers\u2019 meeting this weekend after the attempted attack on a Thalys train headed to Paris.\n\nOn the Greek crisis, \u201cwe had one meeting after another at the highest level,\u201d Mr. Kurz said. \u201cHere, weeks, months go by \u2014 and nothing!\n\n\u201cWe need a European response,\u201d he added, sounding a common plaint. \u201cEurope must wake up at long last and recognize that this is a serious problem.\u201d\n\nThe German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said on Thursday that \u201cwe must reform the Dublin Convention immediately, and find a way of creating binding and objective refugee quotas that take into account the ability of all member states to bear them.\u201d\n\nCostanza Hermanin, a senior analyst in migration and equality for the Open Society Foundations, said that tragedies like the discovery of dead migrants in a truck in Austria sometimes produce change, but that \u201cthere has been a big political reluctance to deal with the problem.\u201d\n\nThe Dublin agreement was negotiated along with Schengen, Ms. Hermanin said, to balance freedom of movement for citizens with protections against migrants. \u201cBut after 25 years, it doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, she said, the situation is evolving rapidly now. \u201cSix to eight months ago it would have been completely unthinkable that states would call for a complete revision of E.U. asylum policy, as the Germans are doing,\u201d she said.\n\nThe numbers are large \u2014 the United Nations reported that about 310,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe this year, about 40 percent more than in all of 2014.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Hermanin said that tougher refugee policies now in those countries are prompting some refugees to leave and head for Europe.\n\nVideo\n\nBabar Baloch, the United Nations refugee agency spokesman for Central Europe, said that \u201cEurope\u2019s asylum mechanisms are dysfunctional\u201d without proper reception facilities in most countries.\n\n\u201cThey need to bring in a system in which wherever these people arrive they\u2019re helped on the spot,\u201d Mr. Baloch said. And given \u201cthe lack of legal avenues\u201d for refugees to come to Europe, there is instead a growing network of criminal people smugglers along dangerous routes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a larger way, the migrant crisis is also a failure of geopolitics and the European Union\u2019s own \u201cneighborhood policy,\u201d designed to stabilize the countries of North Africa and the Balkans with economic aid and advice. The point of the policy is not simply altruistic, but to encourage the people who live there to stay there.\n\nThe overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, which European nations assisted in, has produced a chaotic Libya. The result has been in essence a failed state very close to Europe, even as the Continent has been reluctant to deal with consequences it helped create.\n\nThose effects have included large numbers of migrants and asylum seekers, both Libyan and foreign, who now use the territory as a launching pad, and a major criminal economy built on people smuggling.\n\nSimilarly, the West\u2019s inability to stanch the long civil war in Syria is generating its own blowback, creating a security nightmare that has sent nearly half the country\u2019s population fleeing for security.\n\nThat has also complicated arguments in Europe, because fear of migrants has been coupled with likely exaggerated fears that radical Islamic jihadists will mix with the migrant flow and bring terrorism into a borderless Europe.\n\nTogether with the long and unfinished euro crisis, these concerns are feeding right-wing and populist parties in Europe and undermining the credibility of the European Union, not just in Britain but in crucial member countries like France and Italy.", "summary": "Other countries, like Britain, are strictly applying regulations to dissuade migrants and asylum seekers, while opposing a European Commission proposal in June for mandatory quotas for settlement, to help share the burden.The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said on Thursday that \u201cwe must reform the Dublin Convention immediately, and find a way of creating binding and objective refugee quotas that take into account the ability of all member states to bear them.\u201dCostanza Hermanin, a senior analyst in migration and equality for the Open Society Foundations, said that tragedies like the discovery of dead migrants in a truck in Austria sometimes produce change, but that \u201cthere has been a big political reluctance to deal with the problem.\u201dBut both Ms. Hermanin and Mr. Betts of Oxford University said that sharing even 310,000 people among the 28 countries of the European Union \u201cshould not be unmanageable,\u201d and that the numbers pale when compared with the 3.5 million Syrian refugees that Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon alone are hosting.Together with the long and unfinished euro crisis, these concerns are feeding right-wing and populist parties in Europe and undermining the credibility of the European Union, not just in Britain but in crucial member countries like France and Italy."}
