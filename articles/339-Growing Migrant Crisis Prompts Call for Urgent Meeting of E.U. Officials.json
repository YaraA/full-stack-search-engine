Officials", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/world/europe/growing-migrant-crisis-prompts-call-for-urgent-meeting-of-eu-officials.html", "body": "The gruesome discoveries last week of 71 migrants\u2019 bodies in a truck on an Austrian highway and of more than 100 people who drowned off Libya have intensified pressure on the European Union to come up with a safer common system for the surge of migrants from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria, Iraq, Sudan and other countries in crisis.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to take measures immediately to face up to the challenge from these migrant flows,\u201d the three ministers said in a statement.\n\nThe German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has spoken out for a compassionate reception of migrants after weeks of silence on the issue. She was pressed in part by proposals from important members of the Social Democrats, who are junior members of a grand coalition with her Christian Democrats.\n\nThe Social Democrat foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and his party\u2019s leader, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, wrote an article that appeared on Aug. 23 in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung \u2014 which generally favors the Christian Democrats \u2014 and laid out a 10-point program, including a common European code of asylum.\n\nA senior German official, who requested anonymity to address a diplomatic issue, noted that the article had not been written with the interior minister, Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re, a Christian Democrat, in a clear effort to distinguish the Social Democrats in the minds of voters.\n\nMs. Merkel, who tends to weigh facts and public opinion carefully before declaring a position, clearly heard the message. She was also prompted to act by growing criticism from the far right of Germany\u2019s acceptance of migration. Ms. Merkel was booed last week and called a \u201ctraitor\u201d when she visited a shelter for asylum seekers in Heidenau, the site of violent anti-immigrant protests by neo-Nazis. Germany has said it expects up to 800,000 asylum seekers this year, prompting anxiety and political criticism, even though only 310,000 migrants and asylum seekers have reached Europe so far this year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nThere should be \u201cno tolerance for those people who question the dignity of others, no tolerance for those who are not willing to help where legal and human help is required,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, condemning violent protests as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cvile.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe German government said last week that Syrians would be allowed to apply for asylum in Germany, even if they entered the European Union through another country. Under the Dublin Regulation, asylum seekers are required to apply for protection in the first European Union country they reach.\n\nThe failure of the Dublin rules became part of this summer\u2019s turmoil as enormous pressure mounted on Greece and Italy \u2014 nearly all 310,000 migrants this year have entered in those countries. Overwhelmed Greece and Italy \u2014 and now Hungary and other Balkan countries \u2014 are moving migrants through their countries to richer and more welcoming nations like Germany, Sweden and France.\n\nOn Sunday, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, sharply criticized Hungary and other countries that have simply forwarded migrants instead of helping them. \u201cWith regard to all those people who are politically chased out of their country, we have to be able to welcome them,\u201d Mr. Fabius told Europe 1 radio. \u201cEvery country has to respond to that. France, Germany, others have, but when I see certain countries that do not accept these groups, I find that scandalous.\u201d\n\nHe criticized \u201cin particular eastern European states \u2014 they are extremely harsh.\u201d He criticized Hungary especially for trying to put up a wall against migrants, saying that the country \u201cis part of Europe, which has values, and we do not respect those values by putting up fences.\u201d\n\nMs. May, the British home secretary, offered sharp criticism of her own on Sunday, calling Europe\u2019s migration system broken. She blamed the unrestricted travel in the Schengen area, of which Britain is not a member, for worsening the migrant crisis and promoting human smuggling, and in a regular British complaint, she demanded tighter rules on the freedom of movement of even European Union citizens within the bloc.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That is double the figure from 2010, and as much as half of the number came from European Union citizens moving to Britain for jobs in its decently growing economy.\n\nMr. Cameron wants to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u2019s European Union membership before a national referendum on the membership due to be held by the end of 2017, and he is searching for ways to discourage more European Union immigration here, including restrictions on social and tax benefits for up to four years.\n\n\u201cWhen it was first enshrined, free movement meant the freedom to move to a job, not the freedom to cross borders to look for work or claim benefits,\u201d Ms. May said. \u201cWe must take some big decisions, face down powerful interests and reinstate the original principle.\u201d She suggested admitting only European Union citizens who already had a job offer in Britain, terms that the other countries are unlikely to accept.\n\nThe British government is clearly anxious that the chaos over migration, legal and illegal, will make it harder to persuade British voters to remain inside the European Union, even with some negotiated changes."}
