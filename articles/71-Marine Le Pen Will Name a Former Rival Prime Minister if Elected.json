But it is the first time the National Front has entered into a formal alliance with another political party with the hope of forming a joint government, representing an additional step in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s bid to \u201cun-demonize\u201d the party.\n\nMr. Dupont-Aignan has drawn heavy criticism for his endorsement, especially among politicians on the right who noted his past declarations that his \u201cGaullist\u201d convictions \u2014 meaning his attachment to the political heritage of late president Charles de Gaulle \u2014 were incompatible with an alliance with the National Front.\n\n\u201cNicolas Dupont-Aignan is showing his true face, that of betrayal,\u201d the center-right Republican party said in a statement. The Republican candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, did not make it into the second round of the elections, and the party has called on its members to vote against Ms. Le Pen.\n\nMs. Le Pen said the agreement with Mr. Dupont-Aignan had led to \u201cmodifications\u201d in her platform. Mr. Dupont-Aignan mentioned, for instance, a \u201cless systematic\u201d use of import taxes.

France\u2019s current president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, noted on Saturday that the French election was a \u201cEuropean choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice that is being presented on Sunday, May 7 is to know if the French \u2014 not only globally, but individually \u2014 have to fear an exit from the European Union,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. \u201cThey have everything to gain from remaining in the European Union.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s centrist opponent, said on Saturday that her alliance with Mr. Dupont-Aignan was the sign of a \u201creal clarification in French political life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a reactionary, nationalist and anti-European right that has structured itself and that is now an important political force in the second round of this presidential elections,\u201d Mr. Macron said at a campaign event in Usseau, a small town in central France.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Macron, a former investment banker who favors free trade and wants France to remain firmly in the European Union, has a comfortable lead in opinion polls ahead of the runoff.\n\nEven if Ms. Le Pen were elected and Mr. Dupont-Aignan were nominated to become prime minister, it is unclear that he would stay in the job for long. Although the president nominates the prime minister, that person must reflect the political majority in the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of Parliament, to avoid a government-toppling motion of censure.\n\nBut few analysts believe the National Front will gain enough seats in legislative elections in June to obtain a majority, meaning Ms. Le Pen, if elected, could be forced to replace Mr. Dupont-Aignan after those elections.", "summary": "Mr. Dupont-Aignan has drawn heavy criticism for his endorsement, especially among politicians on the right who noted his past declarations that his \u201cGaullist\u201d convictions \u2014 meaning his attachment to the political heritage of late president Charles de Gaulle \u2014 were incompatible with an alliance with the National Front.Still, the two politicians agree on a vast number of policies, including a hard-line approach to security and an emphasis on the need to increase economic protectionism and to reduce the powers of the European Union, which has become one of the campaign\u2019s major issues.\u201cThere is a reactionary, nationalist and anti-European right that has structured itself and that is now an important political force in the second round of this presidential elections,\u201d Mr. Macron said at a campaign event in Usseau, a small town in central France.Mr. Macron, a former investment banker who favors free trade and wants France to remain firmly in the European Union, has a comfortable lead in opinion polls ahead of the runoff.Although the president nominates the prime minister, that person must reflect the political majority in the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of Parliament, to avoid a government-toppling motion of censure."}
