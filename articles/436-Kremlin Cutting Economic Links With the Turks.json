Moscow and Ankara had already been divided over the future of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Turkey insisted that he step aside, while Russia called Mr. Assad a central ally in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe downing of the Russian plane inflamed that rift. Mr. Erdogan maintained Thursday that Turkey was protecting its airspace from Russian incursions. \u201cFaced with the same violation today, Turkey would give the same response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the country that carried out the violation which should question itself and take measures to prevent it from happening again, not the country that was subjected to a violation.\u201d\n\nLater, Mr. Erdogan appeared to soften his remarks somewhat, telling France 24 television: \u201cWe might have been able to prevent this violation of our airspace differently.\u201d\n\nDuring a news conference with Mr. Hollande late Thursday, Mr. Putin suggested that the United States, an ally of Turkey, was responsible for the fate of its warplane, since Moscow had passed on information about where and when its bombers would fly.\n\n\u201cWhat did we give this information to the Americans for?\u201d Mr. Putin asked, rhetorically, before adding: \u201cWe proceed from the assumption that it will never happen again. Otherwise we don\u2019t need any such cooperation with any country.\u201d\n\nImmediately after Turkey shot down the Russian warplane on Tuesday, senior officials in Moscow and Ankara vowed that they wanted to limit any larger conflict. Given that Turkey is a member of NATO, any military confrontation risks pulling in its Western allies.\n\nBut the economic, geographic and historically competitive ties that bind the two faded empires are facing new strains. At the very least, the tension will hamper chances of resolving the bloody war in Syria.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said that while he had expressed regret over the episode in a telephone call on Wednesday to his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, there would be no apology.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe do not need to apologize on an occasion that we are right,\u201d Mr. Cavusoglu said.\n\nMaria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, objected to the failure of Turkish or NATO officials to offer condolences over the two Russian military men who died after the plane was shot down. She also demanded an explanation from Turkey about the death of the pilot, who was killed after he parachuted from the plane. It is believed he was shot by Turkmen insurgents who live along the border on the Syrian side and who are supported by Ankara.\n\nThe insurgents have accused the Russian Air Force of hitting their positions especially hard after the downing, in areas distant from Islamic State strongholds.\n\n\u201cWe think it is justified to intensify our airstrikes,\u201d Mr. Putin said Thursday, suggesting that Russia will respond to the episode with more such attacks rather than with a direct military challenge to Turkey.\n\nEven before any formal plans for economic sanctions were drawn up, Russia was already retaliating. Moscow has a long history of suddenly discovering faults with the goods and services of other nations when diplomatic relations sour.\n\nHundreds of trucks bearing Turkish fruits, vegetables and other products were lining up at the Georgian border with Russia, Russian news media reported, as inspections slowed to a crawl and Russian officials suggested there might be a terrorist threat from the goods.\n\n\u201cThis is only natural in light of Turkey\u2019s unpredictable actions,\u201d Dmitri S. Peskov, the presidential spokesman, told reporters.\n\nIn the Krasnodar region, a group of 39 Turkish businessmen attending an agriculture exhibition were detained for entering Russia on tourist rather than business visas \u2014 a common practice \u2014 and were slated for deportation, according to a report on the website of the Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGovernment officials announced that a special year of cultural exchanges planned for all of 2016 would be canceled.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Russia had been seeking to build the $22 billon South Stream project to avoid sending gas across Ukraine, given its conflict with its neighbor, but balked at the sharing conditions set by the European Union.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Russian government warned against tourism to Turkey, and most major tour operators stopped selling vacation packages. Turkey is among the most popular destinations for the Russian middle class.\n\nSanctions could be damaging for both countries, even if trade was down in 2015 from a year earlier. Russia was the biggest source of Turkish imports in 2014, some $25 billion or 10 percent of the total, according to an analysis by Renaissance Capital, much of it most likely natural gas. Turkey exported $6 billion worth of goods to Russia in 2014, 4 percent of all exports, and nearly 4.5 million Russians visited last year, according to the analysis.\n\nRussia does not always use a calculator in making sanctions decisions. In 2014, when the West imposed economic sanctions for the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, the Kremlin responded by banning food from the West. That caused a surge in prices for Russian consumers.\n\nSome Russian commentators mocked the prospect of sanctions against Turkey in response to the warplane downing.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s response to a loss of a military jet, to an actual declaration of war, involved a ban on chicken imports and a ban on its tourists going on vacation to Turkey,\u201d Arkady Babchenko, a Russian journalist, wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole set of tools this \u2018energy superpower\u2019 was able to set forth to project geopolitical influence when it came to real matters.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the Ottoman Empire, Turkey\u2019s ancestor, was a bloody rival of the Russian Empire, and the confrontation over the warplane mostly evoked a patriotic response across social media.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish people have never been our friends \u2014 artful, cunning and hypocritical,\u201d wrote one man on Facebook, while another vowed that \u201cI will not go to Turkey or buy Turkish products.\u201d\n\nOther Russians lashed out directly at the man who was clashing with their president. \u201cErdogan completely lost the sense of reality \u2014 no good will come of it \u2014 not for him, not for Turkey,\u201d wrote Igor Korotchenko, a military analyst, on Twitter.", "summary": "The standoff between the two prideful leaders boded ill for the mission of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, who met with Mr. Putin in Moscow on Thursday as part of his effort after the Paris attacks to cement an international coalition to confront the Islamic State.
