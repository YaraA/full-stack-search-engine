Demands for a new referendum on Scottish independence could be triggered if the English vote differently from the more pro-European Scots.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Cameron lost no time in highlighting economic and other risks of a British withdrawal, which he called a \u201cleap in the dark.\u201d\n\nBackground on \u2018Brexit\u2019\n\nYet the referendum remains a gamble for Mr. Cameron, who has often sounded critical of the European Union in the past, but has now shifted to support a bloc that he admits he does not love. His tone became noticeably more pro-European after an agreement struck in Brussels on Friday giving concessions to Britain on a range of economic, sovereignty and welfare issues. His most senior allies, including, significantly, Theresa May, the home secretary, will support Mr. Cameron\u2019s bid to stay inside the bloc.\n\nYet six cabinet ministers made it clear on Saturday that they will campaign for a British exit \u2014 known as Brexit.\n\nThe most significant of those is Michael Gove, the justice secretary and a personal friend of Mr. Cameron\u2019s, whose decision personifies the fissures at the top of the Conservative Party.\n\nBut uncertainty surrounds the position of Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, whose support would be seen as a big asset by the \u201cno\u201d campaign because he is renowned as a communicator.\n\nMr. Johnson, long a Euroskeptic, has not yet made his views on withdrawal from the union clear, and his position is thought by many to be significant because the outcome of the referendum is hard to predict.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeanwhile the two main groups campaigning for a British departure lack a convincing leader and are divided on tactics. One favors the argument that the European Union lacks democratic accountability, and that it stifles economic growth. A second group places more emphasis on immigration, and says that Britain can only fully regain control of this policy if it quits the bloc.\n\nSupporters of European Union membership hope that Mr. Cameron\u2019s status as an election-winning prime minister will prove decisive in the referendum campaign, which will be the first British plebiscite on Europe since 1975. Then, Britons voted by a clear margin to stay in what was called the European Economic Community, which they had joined in 1973.\n\nUnder pressure for the right of his own party, Mr. Cameron promised the referendum in 2013, but said he would renegotiate British ties to the bloc first. That effort culminated in an agreement in Brussels late Friday after more than 30 hours of talks.\n\nMr. Cameron argued that the deal was good enough to give Britain \u201cthe best of both worlds,\u201d allowing the country to have the benefits of European Union membership while staying out of its single currency and passport-free travel zone. Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, which wants to quit the bloc, dismissed Mr. Cameron\u2019s agreement as \u201cpathetic.\u201d\n\nWhile not the fundamental shift in the relationship that Mr. Cameron once seemed to promise, the agreement struck did give Britain some significant concessions and safeguards.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These include in-work benefits, which supplement the income of low-paid workers.\n\nThe deal also covered restrictions on child benefits, but Mr. Cameron had to compromise on what he had originally wanted.\n\nMr. Cameron also received safeguards to ensure that Britain\u2019s financial sector would not face discrimination as a result of the fact that Britain did not join the euro currency, and kept the pound sterling.", "summary": "For Britain, a withdrawal would have major implications, too, because it could lose automatic access to Europe\u2019s single market, provoke economic uncertainty and leave the country more isolated internationally.
