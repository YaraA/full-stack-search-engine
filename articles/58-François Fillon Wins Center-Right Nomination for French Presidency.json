{"title": "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon Wins Center-Right Nomination for French Presidency", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/27/world/europe/francois-fillon-wins-center-right-nomination-for-french-presidency.html", "body": "Mr. Fillon, with his themes of restoring France\u2019s identity and national greatness and his tough language on immigrants and Islam, has been making a clear play for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s voters.\n\nHis promise to slash 500,000 government jobs and cut the budget by more than 100 billion euros (about $106 billion) could leave him vulnerable against Ms. Le Pen, who promises to safeguard France\u2019s substantial safety net of government protections and spending. Mr. Fillon told supporters during the campaign that he was going to \u201cbreak down the house,\u201d but many in France don\u2019t want the house broken.\n\nPromises of top-to-bottom economic overhaul have generally brought thousands of demonstrators into the streets. Unions are already sounding warnings about Mr. Fillon\u2019s plans to reduce the state\u2019s role in the economy, and the National Front has heaped scorn on his proposals.\n\nIn his victory speech on Sunday night, Mr. Fillon emphasized traditional French rightist themes of restoring \u201cauthority\u201d and \u201cFrench values,\u201d as he did throughout the campaign, when commentators largely dismissed his chances.\n\n\u201cIn our country, there is an immense need for respect and pride,\u201d Mr. Fillon told cheering supporters in Paris. \u201cThere is also a demand for the authority of the state, and for exemplary behavior from those who govern it. In my conduct, the voters of the right and the center have found the French values to which they are so much attached.\u201d\n\nHis opponent, Mr. Jupp\u00e9, campaigned on a \u201cunity\u201d theme that led many on the right to suggest that he was a leftist in disguise. The notes Mr. Fillon sounded were darker.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Commentators have noted Mr. Fillon\u2019s close relations with Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president.\n\nMr. Fillon served as an overshadowed prime minister when Nicolas Sarkozy was president from 2007-12. In the first round of voting on Nov. 20, he crushed his former boss, who had regularly humiliated him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Catholic from conservative, rural western France, Mr. Fillon entered Parliament in 1981; at 27, he was the house\u2019s youngest member. Catholic voters who appreciated his positions against abortion and same-sex marriage supported him heavily in the presidential race, even though he has promised not to interfere with legal guarantees of either.\n\nMr. Fillon still sits in the National Assembly and lives in a medieval manor house near Le Mans with his family; he has five children. During the campaign, he spoke often of France\u2019s identity and of instilling the country\u2019s \u201cnational epic\u201d in its schools.\n\n\u201cFrance can\u2019t tolerate its slippage,\u201d Mr. Fillon told supporters on Sunday night. \u201cFrance wants truth and action. This past presidential term has been pathetic. We\u2019ve got to end it and start afresh, as we haven\u2019t done in over 30 years.\u201d\n\nMr. Fillon has promised to rewrite France\u2019s 3,000-page labor code, reduce taxes on companies and the rich, raise the retirement age to 65, and lengthen the 35-hour standard workweek. He called his program \u201cmore radical, maybe more difficult,\u201d in a televised debate with Mr. Jupp\u00e9 last week.\n\n\u201cI could have said more agreeable things,\u201d Mr. Fillon said. \u201cBut the only way to keep one\u2019s promises is to have a very precise program.\u201d\n\nHis supporters do not appear to be scared by these promises, at least for now. \u201cHe\u2019s an upright man,\u201d said Roselyne Duchaine, 81, a retiree in Paris\u2019s 17th arrondissement who said she had voted for Mr. Fillon on Sunday.\n\nAnother voter, Thierry Roland, 68, said: \u201cFillon has the rigor. He shows his hand.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Fillon, with his themes of restoring France\u2019s identity and national greatness and his tough language on immigrants and Islam, has been making a clear play for Ms. Unions are already sounding warnings about Mr. Fillon\u2019s plans to reduce the state\u2019s role in the economy, and the National Front has heaped scorn on his proposals.
