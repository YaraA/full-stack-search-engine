The killing stunned Britain, where gun ownership is tightly regulated. It was the first assassination of a sitting member of Parliament since 1990, when members of the Irish Republican Army killed a Conservative lawmaker, Ian Gow.\n\nMs. Hemming, of the Crown Prosecution Service, described Ms. Cox as \u201ca defenseless mother of two young children who served her constituents with passion, exuberance and vitality and was proud to represent a diverse community.\u201d She noted that several people had tried to come to Ms. Cox\u2019s aid, including a 77-year-old man, Bernard Kenny, whom she said Mr. Mair stabbed and seriously injured.\n\nIn addition to murder, Mr. Mair was convicted of grievous bodily harm of Mr. Kenny, a retired coal miner, as well as possession of a firearm with intent to use it, and possession of a dagger.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But on June 23, nearly 52 percent of voters decided that Britain should leave the 28-nation bloc. Prime Minister David Cameron resigned, leaving his successor, Theresa May, with the weighty task of negotiating Britain\u2019s departure from the union, a process that is just beginning to unfold, creating uncertainty in one of the world\u2019s largest economies and beyond.\n\nThe jury was not asked to consider Mr. Mair\u2019s motivations. He had declined to respond to the charges, but his lawyers entered pleas of not guilty on his behalf.\n\nMr. Mair, an unemployed gardener, had a longstanding obsession with Nazi propaganda, white supremacist ideologies and the apartheid era in South Africa, according to evidence presented in court. The Southern Poverty Law Center, in Alabama, reported soon after the killing that Mr. Mair was a \u201cdedicated supporter\u201d of the National Alliance, a neo-Nazi organization in the United States.", "summary": "\u201cOur thoughts are with Jo Cox\u2019s family, who attended the court hearing and have behaved with real strength and dignity throughout,\u201d Ms. Hemming said in her statement, adding that the prosecutors\u2019 office \u201cwill continue to work with criminal justice partners to combat those who seek to sow hatred and division by advancing extremist ideologies.\u201dMs. Cox\u2019s husband, Brendan, told the BBC that he felt only pity for Mr. Mair, and said in a statement that he hoped \u201cthat Jo\u2019s death will have meaning\u201d by focusing attention on her belief \u201cthat we hold more in common than that which divides us.\u201dLike most members of Parliament, Ms. Cox, who was elected in May 2015 to represent Batley and Spen, a district with a large number of retirees and many residents of South Asian origin, argued against leaving the European Union.Prime Minister David Cameron resigned, leaving his successor, Theresa May, with the weighty task of negotiating Britain\u2019s departure from the union, a process that is just beginning to unfold, creating uncertainty in one of the world\u2019s largest economies and beyond.Mr. Mair, an unemployed gardener, had a longstanding obsession with Nazi propaganda, white supremacist ideologies and the apartheid era in South Africa, according to evidence presented in court."}
