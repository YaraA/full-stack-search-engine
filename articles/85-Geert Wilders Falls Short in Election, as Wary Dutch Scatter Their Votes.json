{"title": "Geert Wilders Falls Short in Election, as Wary Dutch Scatter Their Votes", "authors": ["Alissa J.

If Mr. Wilders\u2019s party rises to 20 seats, as the early returns seemed to indicate, it will still be lower than the previous high-water marks.\n\n\u201cAnd some of the traditional parties have moved in a more nationalistic direction, taking a bit of wind out of his sails,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see the same strategy in Germany.\u201d\n\nThe German governing coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, which is facing a stiff election challenge of its own this year, was clearly buoyed by the Dutch result, its foreign ministry sending a warmly enthusiastic message via Twitter.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cLarge majority of Dutch voters have rejected anti-European populists. That\u2019s good news. We need you for a strong #Europe!\u201d it read.\n\nIn the Netherlands\u2019s extremely fractured system of proportional representation \u2014 28 parties ran and 13 are likely to have positions in the 150-seat lower house of Parliament \u2014 the results were, not atypically, something of a dog\u2019s breakfast.\n\nMr. Rutte\u2019s party lost seats, even as it came out on top, and will need to join forces with several others in order to wield power. Virtually all parties said they would not work with Mr. Wilders in a coalition \u2014 so toxic he remains \u2014 though his positions are likely to infuse parliamentary debate.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Dutch officials refused him landing rights.\n\nMr. Wilders, who has seemed to relish being called the \u201cDutch Donald Trump,\u201d has been so extreme that some appear to have thought twice about supporting him.\n\nHe has called for banning the Quran because he compares it to Hitler\u2019s work \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d which the Netherlands banned, and for closing mosques and Islamic cultural centers and schools.\n\nElection turnout was high, with polling places seeing a steady stream of voters from early morning until the polls closed at 9 p.m. Of the 12.9 million Dutch citizens eligible to cast ballots, more than 80 percent voted.\n\nSome polling places ran out of ballots and called for additional ones to be delivered. There were so many candidates listed that the ballots were as voluminous as bath towels and had to be folded many times over to fit into the ballot box.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe percentage of the vote that a party receives translates into the number of seats it will get in Parliament. If a party gets 10 percent of the total votes, it gets 10 percent of seats in the 150-seat Parliament, given to its first 15 candidates listed on the ballot.\n\nThe election was a success for the left-leaning Green Party, led by 30-year-old Jesse Klaver, a relative political newcomer, whose leadership at least tripled the party\u2019s seats, making it the fifth-place finisher and potentially a part of the government.\n\nMr. Klaver ran specifically on an anti-populist platform and worked hard to turn out first-time voters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn these elections there was an overwhelming attention from the foreign press, which is understandable because Brexit happened and Trump was elected, and because France, Germany and maybe Italy will be holding elections,\u201d Mr. Klaver said. \u201cThey asked us: Will populism break through in the Netherlands?\u201d\n\nThe crowd shouted: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the answer that we have for the whole of Europe: Populism did not break through,\u201d Mr. Klaver said.\n\nAnother striking development was the first-time election of three members of Denk (Think), a new party formed by two former Labor Party members of Turkish background. (The third member elected to Parliament, Farid Azarkan, is Moroccan-Dutch.) It will be the only ethnic party in the Dutch Parliament and is a reminder that Turks are the largest immigrant community in the Netherlands. There are roughly 400,000 first-, second-, or third-generation Turkish immigrants in the nation.\n\nThe big loser was the center-left Labor Party, which was expected to drop from being the second largest party in Parliament, with 38 seats and a position as Mr. Rutte\u2019s coalition partner. The party was expected to win only nine seats.\n\nIn past elections the impact of extremist right-leaning parties has been largely blunted by a political system that for more than a century has resulted in governance by coalition.\n\nThis year\u2019s election may give the Netherlands its most fragmented government in history. Some political analysts believe it could take weeks or months to form a government and that the governing coalition will be fragile.\n\nIn Belgium, which has a similar political system as the Netherlands, it famously took nearly a year and a half after inconclusive elections in June 2010 to form a government.", "summary": "In the Netherlands, the results betrayed a lingering distrust of turning over the reins of power to the far right, even as its message dominated the campaign and was likely to influence policies in the new government.
