Last year, about 500 people were reported dead or missing at sea, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nWhile praising volunteer associations, law enforcement officials and residents of the island for the assistance they have provided to the migrants, the pope criticized the \u201cglobalization of indifference\u201d that he said was widespread among too many others. We \u201chave forgotten how to cry\u201d for migrants lost at sea and \u201ctake care of each other,\u201d the pope said in his homily.\n\nPhoto\n\nOfficials in Lampedusa said they hoped the pope\u2019s visit would bring attention to what they saw as a humanitarian disaster.\n\n\u201cThis island is the setting of one of the most epochal dramas of our time, but it is ignored,\u201d said Giuseppina Nicolini, the mayor of Lampedusa. \u201cThe numbers of those lost at sea are those of a war, but a silent war that no one speaks of, except a few blogs that no one reads.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one speaks of the heartache that is acted out here,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Ms. Nicolini spoke of fishing boats crammed with 500 people, or rubber dinghies built for 20 carrying five times as many people. \u201cMany of the landings are because of rescue operations,\u201d she said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This trip, too, caught many by surprise, an unexpected decision made after the pope was \u201cprofoundly moved by the recent wreck involving a boat transporting migrants from Africa,\u201d the Vatican said in a statement on July 1.\n\nThe pope has also said he wants a simpler church that shuns worldliness and instead ministers to the poor and dispossessed.\n\nAt the end of the Mass, Archbishop Francesco Montenegro of Agrigento, Sicily, described Lampedusa as the island of \u201chope and death,\u201d a \u201creef and a lighthouse\u201d that for too many has become a tomb.
