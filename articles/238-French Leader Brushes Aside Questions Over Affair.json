But his responses will most likely satisfy the French, said Pierre Haski, the top editor at Rue89, an online publication, who was among those attending.\n\n\u201cThere was a kind of sincerity in his first statement,\u201d said Mr. Haski, adding: \u201cObviously anyone can be in his shoes and would be so embarrassed to have the dirty laundry of a couple in public. I don\u2019t think this will be analyzed as anything against him, to be honest.\u201d\n\nPolling has suggested that most French sympathize with Mr. Hollande and do not believe that he should be evaluated based on the women in his life.\n\nThe liaisons of French politicians and their demands for privacy are viewed as more acceptable than they are in the United States, which has a more puritanical approach. And as important, the French president still enjoys some of the respect that used to be due a monarch, so his private life is not a matter of discussion unless he chooses it to be.\n\nFrench commentators drew a sharp line between what Mr. Hollande said about his private life and what he said about economics, seeing both as important. On economics, some welcomed what they called a change in tone on fiscal matters, describing him as more decisive, leaderlike and clear.\n\nHis economic policy moves gratified business and upset labor, but suggested that he was ready to make some of the structural changes, including lowering taxes and cutting the budget, that he had avoided since his election in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the center-right opposition criticized him for trying to divert the public\u2019s attention from his private life by outlining a dizzying number of policies, supporters saw it as part of an effort to rebrand himself politically and show that he is not antibusiness.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Hollande proposed a raft of new policies under the rubric of a \u201cresponsibility pact\u201d among business, labor and the government.\n\nHe promised a roughly $41 billion cut in payroll taxes for business and independent workers and said he would reduce the French budget by about $70 billion by 2017, which would reduce the deficit by 4 percent.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a political and policy analyst at the Foundation for Strategic Research, noted that whether talking about the economy or his personal life, Mr. Hollande had shown self-control throughout the news conference, refusing to be drawn into emotional displays.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
