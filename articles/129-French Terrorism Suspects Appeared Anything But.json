It is profoundly destabilizing for society. Now, the threat can come from anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt calls for heightened vigilance,\u201d Mr. Bitz added. \u201cThese are not people who are outside French society.\u201d\n\nIn the days that followed the arrests, French authorities congratulated themselves on nipping in the bud what they called a \u201cdeadly\u201d plot. The men were set to \u201cgo into action imminently,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Molins, France\u2019s chief terrorism prosecutor, said in Paris soon after the arrests.\n\n\u201cThe Strasbourg cell had instructions to get weapons, given by a commander in the Iraq-Syria zone,\u201d Mr. Molins said, adding that weapons and pledges of allegiance to ISIS were found in searches.\n\nThe authorities would not release the men\u2019s full names. But Mr. Molins said that at least two, the cargo handler and the school employee, apparently tried to get to Syria, making it at least as far as Turkey.\n\nMr. Molins, counterterrorism\u2019s public face in France, blasted the French media for revealing that undercover agents had been used in the eight-month investigation. Otherwise, he insisted that the arrests had forestalled \u201can action envisaged by the Strasbourg group for the first of December.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis weekend another man connected to the Strasbourg cell was arrested, authorities said, bringing the total to seven, including one in Marseille and one in Morocco. Potential targets, according to the authorities: police headquarters in the heart of Paris, the Christmas market on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and cafes in the city\u2019s 20th Arrondissement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe arrests may offer only a temporary respite. French authorities say they have uncovered 17 plots since the beginning of the year, and made 43 terrorism arrests in November alone.\n\nIt was the second time in two years that the immigrant neighborhoods of Neuhof and Meinau, adjoining each other and cut off by busy highways from the jewel-like half-timbered old city of Strasbourg, have yielded major terrorism arrests.\n\nThese districts of subsidized pastel-colored, low-rise housing are tidy and well maintained, not places of obvious deprivation. But they feel a world away from the prosperous shops of bustling downtown Strasbourg, which is also the seat of the European Parliament. Among the second- and third-generation immigrant population, youth unemployment reaches 50 percent.\n\nIn June, seven of Strasbourg\u2019s young men from the Meinau neighborhood, who had been arrested in 2014, were tried and convicted on terrorism charges in a Paris court.\n\nBut this time the terrorism suspects were different.\n\nThey were not 20-something young Muslims adrift in marginal jobs or unemployed. They did not turn up in the French government\u2019s notorious \u201cS Files,\u201d where thousands are listed as potential threats, including some who are subsequently arrested.\n\nBut it is precisely the inconspicuous profiles of the latest group that have made the men seem all the more menacing. They did not stand out in quiet neighborhoods where the full beards and veils are unusual.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If officials have correctly identified them as terrorists-in-the-making, these men would perfectly fit the Islamic State\u2019s injunctions of concealment and dissimulation.\n\nPeople who knew them from the neighborhood said the men used the internet. One neighbor said he thought that a couple of the men may have tried to go to the war zone, and that recruiters had tried to lure him, too.\n\nThere were certainly more obvious candidates for jihad. The four arrested gave no outward hint of radicalization. Many were surprised that the men would hatch a plot, if that is what they did.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was like, their sister,\u201d said Brik Souhaira, 17. \u201cThey used to, like, pull my cheeks,\u201d she said. \u201cFrankly, I can hardly even believe it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Souhaira was hanging out at Neuhof\u2019s community center with friends on a recent Friday evening. All expressed disapproval of jihadism, and none wore a hint of religion-inspired clothing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re afraid,\u201d said Ibrahim El Kasbaoui, 19, who was also at the center with his buddies. \u201cThese guys were here, near us. They could have done something.\u201d\n\nOne of the men arrested, identified by authorities only as Yassin B., 36, was a popular extracurricular activities coordinator at the elementary school in Meinau. The authorities said they found weapons at his apartment.\n\nOfficials met with parents immediately afterward to quiet their fears. \u201cEverybody thought he was exemplary,\u201d Jamila Haddoum, the Neuhof community center youth director, said.\n\n\u201cHe was very calm,\u201d she said. \u201cSerious. This was somebody who went home in the evenings, who kept his head down. Shy and susceptible.\u201d\n\nThe grocer who was arrested loved children, neighbors said. \u201cHe\u2019s calm, he\u2019s stable,\u201d said Ms. Haddoum.\n\nTwenty minutes up the highway, police and barricades have tightly sealed off the historic center of Strasbourg, a glittering island in the Ill River over which looms a medieval red sandstone cathedral.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPedestrians heading to the city\u2019s famous Christmas Market are searched upon arrival on the island, and cars are not allowed in. Authorities are wary of an attack, especially after the arrests. The undetectable threat preoccupies them.\n\n\u201cThese guys had work, they were reasonably paid, their language was not xenophobic, and from one day to the next found, they themselves arrested at three in the morning,\u201d said Eric Lefebvre, a Strasbourg lawyer who defended two brothers who went to Syria, in the 2014 arrests.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely disturbing,\u201d Mr. Lefebvre said. \u201cIt means there must be others. The state should be worried.\u201d\n\nHamed Ouanoufi, who works at the cultural center in Meinau, said that after the arrests there was another fear there and in Neuhof, where many are already insecure about their place in France: Now anyone can be considered suspect.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks now they can be placed in the S Files,\u201d too, he said.", "summary": "The men were set to \u201cgo into action imminently,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Molins, France\u2019s chief terrorism prosecutor, said in Paris soon after the arrests.It was the second time in two years that the immigrant neighborhoods of Neuhof and Meinau, adjoining each other and cut off by busy highways from the jewel-like half-timbered old city of Strasbourg, have yielded major terrorism arrests.One of the men arrested, identified by authorities only as Yassin B., 36, was a popular extracurricular activities coordinator at the elementary school in Meinau.Twenty minutes up the highway, police and barricades have tightly sealed off the historic center of Strasbourg, a glittering island in the Ill River over which looms a medieval red sandstone cathedral.Hamed Ouanoufi, who works at the cultural center in Meinau, said that after the arrests there was another fear there and in Neuhof, where many are already insecure about their place in France: Now anyone can be considered suspect."}
