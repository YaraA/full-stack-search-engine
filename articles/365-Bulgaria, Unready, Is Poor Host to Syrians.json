Emergency financing from the European Union, he said, will help Bulgaria buy the equipment it needs to process refugees so they can move on. The bloc\u2019s rules require that refugees be registered and fingerprinted in the country where they first enter Europe.", "summary": "\u201cWe were a closed country for nearly 50 years and have no culture of receiving immigrants,\u201d she added, referring to Bulgaria\u2019s position as a Soviet satellite state from the end of World War II until 1989.
