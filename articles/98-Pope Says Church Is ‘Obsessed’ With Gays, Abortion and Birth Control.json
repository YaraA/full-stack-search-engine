{"title": "Pope Says Church Is \u2018Obsessed\u2019 With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control", "authors": ["Laurie Goodstein"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/world/europe/pope-bluntly-faults-churchs-focus-on-gays-and-abortion.html?pagewanted=2&ref=europe", "body": "\u201cA person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality,\u201d he told Father Spadaro. \u201cI replied with another question: \u2018Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?\u2019 We must always consider the person.\u201d\n\nThe interview also serves to present the pope as a human being, who loves Mozart and Dostoyevsky and his grandmother, and whose favorite film is Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Strada.\u201d\n\nFrancis said some had assumed he was an \u201cultraconservative\u201d because of his reputation when he served as the superior of his Jesuit province in Argentina. He said that he was made superior at the \u201ccrazy\u201d young age of 36, and that his leadership style was too authoritarian.\n\n\u201cBut I have never been a right-winger,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my authoritarian way of making decisions that created problems.\u201d\n\nNow, Francis said, he prefers a more consultative leadership style. He has appointed an advisory group of eight cardinals, a step he said was recommended by the cardinals at the conclave that elected him. They were demanding reform of the Vatican bureaucracy, he said, adding that from the eight, \u201cI want to see that this is a real, not ceremonial, consultation.\u201d\n\nThe pope said he has found it \u201camazing\u201d to see complaints about \u201clack of orthodoxy\u201d flowing into the Vatican offices in Rome from conservative Catholics around the world. They ask the Vatican to investigate or discipline their priests, bishops or nuns. Such complaints, he said, \u201care better dealt with locally,\u201d or else the Vatican offices risk becoming \u201cinstitutions of censorship.\u201d\n\nAsked what it means for him to \u201cthink with the church,\u201d a phrase used by the Jesuit founder St. Ignatius, Francis said that it did not mean \u201cthinking with the hierarchy of the church.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis church with which we should be thinking is the home of all, not a small chapel that can hold only a small group of selected people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must not reduce the bosom of the universal church to a nest protecting our mediocrity.\u201d"}
