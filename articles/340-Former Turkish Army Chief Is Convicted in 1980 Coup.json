The two men were accused of setting the stage for an army intervention, then conducting the coup.\n\nSome critics argued that nationalist militants or American agencies had engineered the street clashes to justify army action on Sept. 12, 1980.

Because of his age and infirmity, he may never serve any prison time.\n\nBut Mr. Calislar said that was not important.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is that those behind the coup are held responsible for all of the uprooted lives and dozens who were executed,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNaciye Babalik, a retired teacher who was arrested and tortured for belonging to a women\u2019s group that taught villagers how to read and write and lobbied for day care at factories, said, \u201cThese were crimes against humanity, but I have little faith they will pay.\u201d\n\nShe was a 41-year-old mother when, she says, soldiers stormed her home, blindfolded her and dragged her off in front of her two young daughters.
