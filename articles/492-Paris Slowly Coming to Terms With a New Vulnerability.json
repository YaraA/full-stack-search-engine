Now, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve started to see more and more people buying flowers for gifts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good, it means Parisians are going out again,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we all want to move on.\u201d\n\nA small older woman hovered near the statue of Marianne, fumbling with her umbrella and her purse. She brought a candle to honor the dead, but it was too wet that day, she said, so she would come back later.\n\n\u201cI came also to pay respect to the victims of 1939-44,\u201d she said. \u201cThe victims of the Holocaust are the same,\u201d casualties of the same kind of hatred. Her name, she said, is France Cohen, and she is 78; her father, who was Jewish, was deported during World War II and she reunited with her parents only after the war.\n\nThe recent violence is a reminder of the bloody history of Paris \u2014 the Revolution, the Commune, the German occupations, the bombings around the Algerian war and later. Paris may be, for many, the dream of a sweet, bourgeois life, with elegant aesthetics and fine food, but beyond the patterned cobblestones, it is also a city that has had long experience with enduring trauma.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is another Paris, too, the Paris of the banlieues, the poor, heavily immigrant suburbs, many of them mostly Muslim and black. Clichy-sous-Bois, where the deaths of teenagers fleeing the police set off nationwide rioting 10 years ago, remains one of the poorest towns in France, with unemployment around 40 percent and half the population under 25.\n\nOnly 10 miles from central Paris, there is still no major road or mass transit station despite a decade of promises, and it usually takes 90 minutes to commute each way. In the 10 months since the Charlie Hebdo attacks, when Prime Minister Manuel Valls called the situation in places like Clichy \u201cterritorial, social, ethnic apartheid,\u201d there has been some new investment.\n\nA tram line connecting Clichy to the main suburban railway at Aulnay-sous-Bois is finally under construction, scheduled to open by the winter of 2018, according to the mayor, Olivier Klein, with a subway stop planned for 2023. Some redevelopment has occurred, with old housing projects ripped down for newer construction. \u201cSecurity is also better,\u201d said an older Algerian-born man playing cards, who declined to provide his name. \u201cThe police are more visible and make more rounds.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the last two weeks, there has been a heavy police presence in Clichy, with more patrols and more random stops, or \u201ccontrols,\u201d to check identification papers. \u201cWe\u2019re controlled everywhere now,\u201d said Madalin Silagyi, 22, Romanian-born but in France for a decade. \u201cIn the stations, in the streets, especially the youth.\u201d\n\nSome Muslims and blacks say they feel safer here than in Paris. It is in the city where they are the subject of skeptical looks and police stops.\n\n\u201cParis is more afraid,\u201d Mr. Silagyi said. \u201cThey\u2019d never attack us here,\u201d he said about terrorists. \u201cThey want to hit the French population. Here there are not a lot of French, like in Paris. Here there are Arabs and blacks.\u201d\n\nOf course, many of the people here are French-born, but do not feel \u201cFrench\u201d in the same way as they imagine a white Roman Catholic does. They feel \u201c\u00e9cart\u00e9,\u201d or rejected. Osama Ouriemchi, 37, said, \u201cIt\u2019s worse than after Charlie Hebdo\u201d because \u201cthese attacks give such a bad image to the religion, such a false image,\u201d and \u201cnow in Paris they look at all of us with suspicion, in the shops, on the metro.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nCabra Yakici, 27, who works in Les Bruy\u00e8res cafe in the center of Clichy-sous-Bois, said that \u201cyoung people are afraid to go into Paris.\u201d He was born here, but his mother is Moroccan. In Clichy, he said, \u201cWe feel at home, we feel more secure here, because if something happens, it\u2019s going to happen there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe suburbs are poor, Mr. Yakici said. \u201cBut what I like is the respect people show one another and they help one another. This is something we don\u2019t see in Paris.\u201d\n\nOutside the nearby Caf\u00e9 B\u00e9ni Snassen Angad, named after a mountain range in Morocco, young men in black athletic clothing were smoking marijuana and hanging out. Asked about the attacks in Paris, Mahdi, 21, born in France to Moroccan parents, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a Zionist plot.\u201d Why? \u201cI\u2019ve seen these videos that prove it,\u201d he said, declining to provide his last name. \u201cIt\u2019s the Zionists and it\u2019s all about money.\u201d\n\nHis friends all agreed.\n\nAnother video, he said, proved that Mohammed Merah, who in 2012 killed Muslim French soldiers and then Jews in Toulouse in the name of Al Qaeda, \u201creally had blue eyes\u201d and was not a Muslim at all. \u201cThey pretend that Muslims are the terrorists, but it\u2019s not what religion is about,\u201d Mahdi said. \u201cWe as Muslims are always humiliated.\u201d\n\nAdi Camara, 25, whose parents are from Mali, nodded. He has been out of work for three months and is looking, but \u201cI feel targeted in Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a Muslim, a black, it\u2019s all the same.\u201d\n\nHe added with a sigh, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated in France.\u201d\n\nBack in Paris proper, Geoffrey Cromier, 44, a hairdresser, is the president of the storekeepers association of Rue de Bretagne, in the Marais. He has lost half his clients \u2014 tourists, he said, who canceled their trips here. \u201cParisians will recover and go back to their daily habits,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the tourists? I\u2019m afraid a substantial part of them will disappear, at least through Christmas and the New Year.\u201d\n\nMs. Wagner, the Moroccan-born market-stand owner, said that her business has been hit by the loss of tourism, which will be slow to come back. \u201cBut let\u2019s put things into perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re alive.\u201d", "summary": "Clichy-sous-Bois, where the deaths of teenagers fleeing the police set off nationwide rioting 10 years ago, remains one of the poorest towns in France, with unemployment around 40 percent and half the population under 25.
