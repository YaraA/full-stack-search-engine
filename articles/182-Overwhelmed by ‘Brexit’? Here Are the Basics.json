Mr. Cameron, who led the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign, announced on Friday that he had no \"precise timetable\" but that he believed his successor \u2014 who will manage the process of leaving the union \u2014 should be in place by October.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who backed leaving the E.U., was considered a front-runner to succeed Mr. Cameron. But on June 30, Mr. Johnson announced he would not run for the position of party leader (and therefore prime minister).\n\n\u25a0 Global markets plunged. The British pound plummeted to its lowest level since 1985. Investors fled to the American dollar and the yen.\n\n\u25a0 The U.S. market was down more than 3 percent at the close on June 24, with the Dow shedding over 600 points, after sell-offs overnight in Japan and Hong Kong. The financial damage was more severe on the Continent than in Britain and the United States.\n\n\u25a0 The United Kingdom lost its last remaining AAA credit rating on June 27, when the credit rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the nation to AA, Reuters reported.\n\nIs it a done deal?\n\n\u25a0 The referendum is not legally binding, though it is difficult to imagine that the British government would ignore the will of the voters.\n\nThe process of leaving begins only after the British government invokes a provision of the European Union\u2019s governing treaty known as Article 50 \u2014 an action Mr. Cameron said he would leave to his successor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce Article 50 is invoked, though, Britain could not change its mind and stay in the union unless the 27 other members all agreed.\n\nThe broader impact\n\n\u25a0 Britain would leave the world\u2019s largest common market, with 508 million residents, including 65 million Britons. That would free them from the bloc\u2019s commitment to the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services.\n\nBut it would also bring complications, with some businesses already planning to relocate.\n\n\u25a0 Little will change for at least two years, but the vote sets off a series of negotiations as the country separates from the union\u2019s remaining 27 members.\n\nBritain, which has the bloc\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany, would have to come up with new trading agreements. Almost half its exports are sold on Europe\u2019s common market.\n\n\u25a0 London\u2019s role as a financial center could be imperiled, particularly if the trade in euro-denominated securities moves to rival cities like Paris and Frankfurt.\n\n\u25a0 The immediate effect on travel will be limited, especially as Britain was not a member of the passport-free Schengen zone, which came under heavy pressure last year from the refugee crisis. Americans will find bargains in travel to Britain, because of more favorable exchange rates.\n\n\u25a0 Britain\u2019s security will be largely unaffected: It remains a nuclear power, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a leader of NATO.\n\n\u25a0 Scotland and Northern Ireland could go their own way. Both voted overwhelmingly to stay in the E.U. But prominent political leaders in Scotland and Northern Ireland called on Friday for new moves toward separating from Britain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nScotland, which voted in 2014 to remain in the United Kingdom, may revisit that referendum.\n\nNorthern Ireland has an open border with the Republic of Ireland, a member of the bloc. Border crossings could now be tightened, and pressure could increase for unification, prompting instability in both places.\n\n\u25a0 Calls for similar action have spread throughout Europe. \u201cWe must now have the same referendum,\u201d French far-right National Front party leader Marine Le Pen tweeted. Politicians made similar appeals in Denmark and the Netherlands. In Italy, one politician called for a referendum on whether to keep the euro currency.\n\nThe reaction\n\n\u25a0 President Obama said in a statement: \u201cThe people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision.\u201d He pledged that the U.K. and the E.U. would remain \u201cindispensable partners of the United States\u201d and that Britain\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the United States would endure.\n\n\u25a0 Hillary Clinton: \u201cWe respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Donald J. Trump: \u201cI said this was going to happen, and I think that it\u2019s a great thing.\u201d\n\nThe British people \u201chave declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cA Trump administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany expressed disappointment with the vote and called for European unity. \u201cOur goal should be to create a future relationship between Great Britain and the European Union that is close and partner-like.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Moscow maintained its stance that the British referendum was of little direct concern. President Vladimir V. Putin said, \u201cThis will certainly have consequences for Britain, for Europe and for us. The consequences will be global, they are inevitable; they will be both positive and negative.\u201d"}
