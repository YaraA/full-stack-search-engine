Without that, it cannot pay a bond that comes due on May 17 or meet expenses past July.\n\n\u201cGreece must know that there is no alternative to agreed reforms if it wants to stay in the euro zone,\u201d J\u00f6rg Asmussen, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said Tuesday.\n\nBut as Sunday\u2019s elections made clear, Greek voters have grown weary of such statements, which many believe are empty threats, and flocked to Syriza, which received nearly 17 percent of the vote by trying to carve out a space that is opposed to the loan agreement but in favor of Greece\u2019s staying with the euro . Syriza came in second to New Democracy\u2019s 19 percent and ahead of the Socialists\u2019 13 percent, both parties\u2019 worst showing since their founding in 1974.\n\nMr. Tsipras has said that he will seek to form a leftist-led government based on five points: the abolition of the debt deal with foreign creditors and all related laws that have led to pension and wage cuts; the abolition of laws overruling collective labor contracts; the introduction of changes to the political system, including greater accountability for members of Parliament; the introduction of state inspections of the banking system; and the imposition of a moratorium on Greece\u2019s debt repayments.\n\nBankers are particularly concerned about Syriza\u2019s proposal to nationalize the banks as a condition of the still-incomplete bank recapitalization, a move the party says is aimed at ensuring that the banks lend to the real economy, not engage in speculation.\n\nCritics say that Syriza\u2019s proposals are unrealistic, given Greece\u2019s dire financial straits. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to be on the sidewalk and shout against the troika, but if you have to deal with the problems of the Greek economy, it\u2019s different,\u201d said Paschos Mandravelis, a columnist for the daily newspaper Kathimerini.\n\nPhoto\n\nPolitical analysts said that Mr. Tsipras would most likely not be able to form a left-wing coalition government, since he did not have the support of the hard-line Communist Party. Instead, he is seen as trying to rally the support of a range of left-wing parties to join a possible future coalition after a new round of elections that could come in June.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Mr. Tsipras fails to form a government, the baton passes to Mr. Venizelos.\n\nThe most likely situation now is for the president, Mr. Papoulias, to appoint an interim government and call new elections in 30 days. That would lead to more instability, since Greece has a number of crucial deadlines in the coming weeks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It also has to complete a bank recapitalization.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Samaras, the New Democracy leader, accused Mr. Tsipras of putting the country\u2019s euro zone membership in jeopardy. \u201cMr. Tsipras, with his statements today, is doing everything possible not to form a government,\u201d Mr. Samaras said, adding that Mr. Tsipras was asking him to \u201cput my signature to the destruction of Greece.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t do this,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Samaras said his party would be prepared to back a minority government \u201cas long as it secures the country\u2019s position in the euro zone and its national interest.\u201d But, he said, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s statement left no doubt \u201cthat he has no intention of safeguarding Greece\u2019s European identity and future\u201d and revealed \u201cunbelievable arrogance.\u201d\n\nMr. Venizelos also tried on Tuesday to place the onus for the instability on Mr. Tsipras, noting that the Socialists, known in Greece as Pasok , had proposed a broad coalition. \u201cPasok has only one precondition: to ensure Greece does not exit the euro zone and the E.U.,\u201d he said, referring to the European Union .\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Tsipras said that Greeks had supported him, but not as a protest vote. \u201cThis was not an angry vote; it was a mature and conscious decision,\u201d he said, contending that the chief victory of the elections was that the two main parties were no longer in a position to impose austerity measures on the Greek people.", "summary": "But as Sunday\u2019s elections made clear, Greek voters have grown weary of such statements, which many believe are empty threats, and flocked to Syriza, which received nearly 17 percent of the vote by trying to carve out a space that is opposed to the loan agreement but in favor of Greece\u2019s staying with the euro .Mr. Tsipras has said that he will seek to form a leftist-led government based on five points: the abolition of the debt deal with foreign creditors and all related laws that have led to pension and wage cuts; the abolition of laws overruling collective labor contracts; the introduction of changes to the political system, including greater accountability for members of Parliament; the introduction of state inspections of the banking system; and the imposition of a moratorium on Greece\u2019s debt repayments.These include paying the bond that comes due in May and identifying a financing gap of 11.5 billion euros from the 2013 and 2014 budgets \u2014 equivalent to 5.5 percent of Greece\u2019s gross domestic product.Mr. Samaras said his party would be prepared to back a minority government \u201cas long as it secures the country\u2019s position in the euro zone and its national interest.\u201d But, he said, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s statement left no doubt \u201cthat he has no intention of safeguarding Greece\u2019s European identity and future\u201d and revealed \u201cunbelievable arrogance.\u201d\u201cThis was not an angry vote; it was a mature and conscious decision,\u201d he said, contending that the chief victory of the elections was that the two main parties were no longer in a position to impose austerity measures on the Greek people."}
