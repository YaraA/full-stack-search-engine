The No\u2019s are cautious and accused of scaremongering.\u201d\n\nMs. Fleming added: \u201cAt the end of the day it comes down to cold hard facts \u2014 economics over emotion.\u201d\n\nEconomic stability is an important issue for many Times readers, who said it was the main factor in their decision-making process.\n\nChris Burt from Stirling, Scotland, wrote in a comment on a Times article that the referendum has conjured up emotions about national identity as well as practical concerns regarding the potential for an independent Scotland\u2019s prosperity.\n\n\u201cI personally feel very British \u2014 my parents are English, I was born and raised in central Scotland, and I have studied at university in London. The most difficult aspect for me would be to lose this British identity, and I think it would be very sad to no longer have the Team GB spirit that took over the entire country just two years ago,\u201d he wrote, referring to the enthusiasm for Britain\u2019s athletes during the Olympic Games in London.\n\n\u201cPragmatically, I foresee the economic consequences of independence as being too counterintuitive to Scottish prosperity,\u201d Mr. Burt added. \u201cThe huge transaction costs associated with businesses adapting to a new governance structure and uncertainty alone are reasons to heed from independence. Our fiscal control is reduced no matter which currency an independent Scotland would end up using, and EU membership would not provide Scotland with any more sovereignty than is already surrendered to Westminster, with Brussels and the European Commission and Court of Human Rights being certainly less accessible to Scottish interests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKirsten Rees, a small-business owner, wrote on Facebook that the international attention given to Thursday\u2019s referendum has made her feel even more pressure to make the right choice.\n\n\u201cWe know the eyes of the world are on Scotland right now, and none of us want to see our country fall,\u201d Ms. Rees wrote.\n\nShe is confident, though, that the Scottish people will ultimately come together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s divided the nation for the past six months, however, we are a very proud people and no matter which way the vote goes, I think everyone will throw their weight behind it.\u201d", "summary": "Evelyn N\u00edcDhonnacha wrote on Facebook that she still needs \u201csome hard, objective facts\u201d to make her decision, but neither side has provided sufficient rationale to join their cause.She wrote that her choice boils down to \u201ca decision between short-term economic stability and freedom from the burden of trident,\u201d referring to the nuclear-armed submarines based in Scotland.Another reader, Joan Fleming, wrote on Facebook that both campaigns have been emotional, forcing her to look outside the United Kingdom for balance and perspective.The most difficult aspect for me would be to lose this British identity, and I think it would be very sad to no longer have the Team GB spirit that took over the entire country just two years ago,\u201d he wrote, referring to the enthusiasm for Britain\u2019s athletes during the Olympic Games in London.Kirsten Rees, a small-business owner, wrote on Facebook that the international attention given to Thursday\u2019s referendum has made her feel even more pressure to make the right choice."}
