With 98 percent of the votes tallied, the separatist parties had won the most parliamentary seats and about 48 percent of the votes amid a record turnout.\n\nThe standoff between Mr. Rajoy and Mr. Mas started in 2012 as a financial dispute over the tax contribution that wealthy Catalonia should make to poorer regions of Spain. Mr. Mas then turned his frustrated demand for fiscal concessions into a full-fledged drive for independence.\n\nVideo\n\nAfter voting on Sunday, H\u00e9ctor Carnet, 35, an information technology administrator, said he would not have imagined voting for independence three years ago. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see that it\u2019s better to go that way than stick with a Madrid government that hasn\u2019t offered us any decent alternative,\u201d he said.\n\nBut his wife, who declined to give her name, disagreed. \u201cWe need to build a stronger Europe rather than add new countries,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes sense to fight for independence in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThe regional parliamentary elections were called by Mr. Mas, leader of Catalonia\u2019s governing Convergence party. He presented it as a proxy vote on independence after Convergence agreed with the other main left-wing separatist party to run a joint list of candidates.\n\nThe joint \u201cTogether for Yes\u201d list won 62 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament, according to the preliminary count. That will translate into a majority if the \u201cYes\u201d leaders can form a coalition with a far-left separatist party known by its Catalan acronym of CUP. CUP, which won 10 seats on Sunday, has opposed Mr. Mas\u2019s public spending cuts and accused Convergence of widespread corruption after its founder admitted to tax evasion last year.\n\nPhoto\n\nRa\u00fcl Romeva, leader of the \u201cYes\u201d list, told supporters on Sunday that \u201cnobody can say that we don\u2019t have legitimacy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it is likely to remain contentious that under the Spanish system of proportional representation, separatist parties managed to win the most seats without a majority of votes. Opponents of secession argued that if separatist leaders wanted Sunday\u2019s vote to be equated to a plebiscite, then votes counted more than parliamentary seats.\n\nOpponents of secession have warned of significant economic problems on regional and national levels if Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain\u2019s economic output, were to break away. The president of the Spanish central bank recently said that Catalan banks would be cut off from the funding of the European Central Bank, which has been critical for financial institutions that were crippled by the euro debt crisis and unchecked property lending.\n\nEuropean leaders have also recently waded into the debate, aware that any unilateral secession by Catalonia could send the European Union into uncharted waters. The European Union\u2019s ability to produce a common response to crises has already been severely tested recently by a wave of migrants from Syria and other Middle Eastern and African countries. A Catalan secession could also fuel the separatist claims of other European regions.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring a recent visit to Madrid, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain suggested that if Catalonia seceded, it would have to reapply for European Union membership. Last September, Scots rejected independence in a referendum authorized by Mr. Cameron\u2019s government.\n\nSunday\u2019s vote took place two months before national elections that could also fragment Spanish politics, as two emerging parties threaten to help unseat Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party.\n\nThe left-wing party Podemos, while calling on Catalans to remain within Spain, supports a referendum on independence. The main opposition Socialist party has also pledged a constitutional change that could turn Spain into a federation.\n\nAccording to preliminary results in Catalonia, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party got 11 seats, down from 19 in 2012, allowing instead the Citizens party to become the clear leader of the anti-secession opposition in the next Catalan Parliament. The Citizens party won 25 seats on Sunday, up from nine in 2012. The Catalan version of Podemos won 11 seats on Sunday, while the Socialists came in third, with 16 seats.\n\nWith a possible year-end overhaul of the national government also in mind, Mr. Mas and other separatist leaders talked Sunday night about a victory for their secessionist project, but without making it clear whether or when a new Catalan government could declare unilateral independence.\n\nInstead, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, leader of the Socialist party, underlined the failure of separatists to win a majority of votes and pledged to make a broader Spanish constitutional change to help reunite the country if the Socialists return to power in the national elections.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have a Catalonia divided in two blocs, and the task of those who form the new government should be to heal these wounds,\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez said in a televised briefing from Madrid."}
