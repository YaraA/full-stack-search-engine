But Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government and the courts had declared the vote illegal, and the police officers sent to block polling places wounded hundreds in clashes.\n\nOnly about 40 percent of the Catalan electorate took part, after Madrid advised those who opposed secession to stay away from polling stations.\n\nThe latest statements from each side now move the dispute to the brink of a potentially explosive confrontation.\n\n\u00cd\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo, spokesman for the Spanish government, said at a news conference that Madrid was ready to use \u201call the means within its reach to restore the legality and constitutional order as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nYet such steps are fraught with uncertainty in a country that adopted its democratic constitution only in 1978, after the death of its longtime dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco.\n\nLast week, Mr. Rajoy initiated a request to invoke a broad and forceful tool that has never before been used \u2014 Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution \u2014 which would allow him to take direct control of Catalonia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe said he could resort to such a step if Mr. Puigdemont did not clearly back down from a threat to declare independence.\n\nBut on Thursday, Mr. Puigdemont sent a defiant letter to Mr. Rajoy, blaming him for escalating the conflict by refusing to meet and negotiate.\n\n\u201cIf the government continues to prevent dialogue and maintains the repression,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u201cthe Parliament of Catalonia could go ahead, if it deems it opportune, and vote the formal declaration of independence.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Madrid have repeatedly warned in recent days that Mr. Rajoy would consider anything short of a clear withdrawal of the declaration of independence to be unacceptable, after what he deemed an unsatisfactory response from Mr. Puigdemont on Monday.\n\nArticle 155 would give Madrid the authority to suspend Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan lawmakers, and to take charge of the region\u2019s autonomous administration, including the Catalan broadcaster and autonomous police force, although Mr. Rajoy has not publicly committed to an emergency intervention.\n\nBay of Biscay FRANCE CATALONIA Barcelona PORTUGAL Madrid SPAIN Mediterranean Sea Strait of Gibraltar ALGERIA 200 Miles MOROCCO\n\nIt is unclear what Mr. Rajoy will propose to his cabinet on Saturday, but he may try to gradually raise pressure on the fragile coalition of Catalan separatists rather than risk a forceful intervention that could further galvanize the independence movement.\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, an official from the main opposition Socialist party, indicated at a news conference on Thursday that the party would support Mr. Rajoy \u2014 as long as the prime minister made limited and short use of Article 155, and also somehow kept \u201cself-government\u201d in Catalonia.\n\nUsing constitutional powers, Mr. Rajoy could appoint a caretaker administration in Catalonia. Mr. Puigdemont, on the other hand, could face sedition charges and ultimately a long prison sentence for presenting a unilateral declaration of independence that violates Spain\u2019s Constitution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In his letter on Thursday, Mr. Puigdemont mentioned the arrest of the two leaders as evidence of Spain\u2019s repressive stance.\n\nCatalonia, which has its own language and culture, is an important engine of the Spanish economy. Independence aspirations have built in recent years over a host of social and economic grievances.\n\nThose tensions grew as Mr. Rajoy and Catalan leaders talked past one another, turning the kind of dispute that might have been defused years ago into a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nThe rising uncertainty and the threat of declaring independence have already prompted hundreds of companies to relocate their headquarters outside Catalonia, further straining the unwieldy separatist coalition that holds a majority of the seats in the regional Parliament.\n\nPhoto\n\nHard-line secessionists want an abrupt and unilateral rupture with the central government in Madrid, while conservative and more moderate separatists are increasingly worried about the economic consequences for Catalonia.\n\nLuis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, told Parliament on Thursday that the relocation of Catalan companies was \u201conly an appetizer of what could happen if independence was confirmed \u2014 something that the government will not allow.\u201d\n\nMr. Puigdemont sent his latest letter after an emergency meeting of his conservative party late Wednesday, during which lawmakers gave clear support for not withdrawing the declaration of independence, according to local news reports.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, secessionism has divided Catalonia. Separatist parties won control of the regional Parliament in 2015, but with only 48 percent of the vote.\n\nN\u00faria Mar\u00edn, the Socialist mayor of L\u2019Hospitalet de Llobregat, the second-largest city in Catalonia, just southwest of Barcelona, said on Thursday that politicians on both sides should take the blame for plunging Catalonia into a crisis.\n\n\u201cI believe that with threats on the part of one side or the other, we won\u2019t now solve this situation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are sadly seeing that companies are leaving while we are sending letters to one another.\u201d\n\nWhatever the government decides on Saturday, the Catalan crisis is set to drag on: Mr. Rajoy would need approval from the Senate before intervening in Catalonia.\n\nMr. Rajoy\u2019s governing Popular Party has a majority in the Senate, and Podemos, a far-left party, is the only major opposition group that is opposed to using Article 155 in Catalonia. Instead, Podemos has suggested that Spain should hold a nationwide referendum over Catalonia\u2019s future statehood.\n\nPablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, said Thursday morning that \u201cSpain can\u2019t appear to be like a banana republic that has problems of democracy.\u201d He added, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to threaten or repress Catalonia, but we want to convince Catalonia that Spain is a collective project that is worth it.\u201d"}
