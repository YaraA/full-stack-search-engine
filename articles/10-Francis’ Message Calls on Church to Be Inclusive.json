{"title": "Francis\u2019 Message Calls on Church to Be Inclusive", "authors": ["Jim Yardley", "Laurie Goodstein"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/world/europe/pope-francis-amoris-laetitia.html", "body": "But Francis also makes clear the vision he wants local bishops and priests to follow: as a church that greets families with empathy and comfort rather than with unbending rules and rigid codes of conduct.\n\nThe scope of \u201cAmoris Laetitia\u201d is typical Francis: a broad-ranging blend of biblical passages, meditations on marital love, homespun advice on familial manners, passages bemoaning the frenetic loneliness of modern life and a call for families to come closer to the church, and vice versa.\n\nHe admits that the church has made mistakes in alienating families and dedicates many passages to describing the pressures brought on families by poverty, migration, drug abuse and violence.\n\nJust as he used his environmental encyclical, \u201cLaudato Si\u2019,\u201d to call on national governments to enact legislation to fight climate change, Francis now calls for governments to provide support for families in the form of health care, education and employment. He describes families as under siege by the pressures of modern life.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, parents come home exhausted, not wanting to talk, and many families no longer even share a common meal,\u201d Francis wrote. He described \u201csevere stress\u201d on families \u201cwho often seem more caught up with securing their future than with enjoying the present.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a broader cultural problem, aggravated by fears about steady employment, finances and the future of children,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough Francis has earned a reputation as a reformer, some liberal Catholics may be disappointed. Many had hoped Francis might go further, perhaps by detailing health exceptions to the ban on contraception, expanding the roles for women in the church or prescribing a clear process that would permit Catholics who divorced and remarried outside the church to receive communion.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as innovative as many had hoped,\u201d said Lucetta Scaraffia, a scholar of Catholicism in Rome, adding, \u201cThe result is quite modest with respect to the investment and expectations that the world had.\u201d\n\nThe document is likely to stir debate and disagreement among many Catholics, especially in interpreting the pope\u2019s language explaining how priests should work with divorced and remarried Catholics to help them return to full standing in the church.\n\nFrancis convened two successive assemblies, or synods, of bishops from around the world to examine the challenges facing modern families.\n\nSynods under Francis\u2019 predecessors were relatively sleepy affairs, but Francis told the bishops he wanted them to speak their minds without holding back. And they did.\n\nBoth synods were contentious and, the participants said afterward, ultimately enlightening. The battle lines were basically drawn over what it means for the church to be pastoral and merciful in its approach to people who are not living in accord with the Christian ideal of the intact, nuclear family. How far should the church bend to respond to modern life or to bring people back?\n\nBoth synods concluded with final reports written by participating bishops, and Francis has drawn extensively on those reports in his exhortation.\n\nFrancis adopts the solution introduced by the German-speaking bishops at the second synod: inviting divorced and remarried Catholics who have not had their first marriages annulled to seek the counsel of a priest. The priest, in private and personal conversations known as the \u201cinternal forum,\u201d could help them to examine their conscience and determine their future participation in church life.\n\n\u201c \u2018Amoris Laetitia\u2019 is a quietly revolutionary document,\u201d said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit who is editor at large for America magazine. \u201cIt restores the role of personal conscience and reminds pastors to meet people where they are. It will be a great encouragement especially to divorced and remarried Catholics and anyone who feels they have been unwelcome in the church. The message is: Welcome.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConservative Catholics, who have already expressed concern that Francis could destabilize the church and undermine doctrine, were far less impressed. R. R. Reno, a Catholic theologian and editor of First Things, a conservative journal of religion and public life, lamented what he called a \u201cmuddy\u201d document that substitutes the church\u2019s \u201crules and laws and requirements\u201d with \u201ctalk about ideals and values.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an ill-judged shift,\u201d Mr. Reno said. \u201cThis document clearly opens up the possibility that a priest may determine that a divorced and remarried person is worthy to receive communion, but under what terms and why is muddy.\u201d\n\nAt a Vatican news conference to unveil the document, Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn of Austria said that Francis was trying to erase the distinction between \u201cregular\u201d and \u201cirregular\u201d families, even as he continued to advocate the Christian ideal of marriage.\n\nCardinal Sch\u00f6nborn, himself the child of divorced parents, said the pope\u2019s message is that God\u2019s mercy applies to all.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

He argued, however, that the pope is not changing church doctrine on the family but is deepening the understanding outlined by Pope John Paul II in his own document on the family, \u201cFamiliaris Consortio.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a classic example of the organic development of doctrine,\u201d Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn said. \u201cThere is innovation and continuity.\u201d\n\nHomosexuality was another hot-button issue, and Francis took his cues from the majority view in the synods. (During the first synod, an interim report written by a committee of bishops used language that was strikingly welcoming to gay people, but it received so much criticism from other bishops at the synod that it was gone by the final report.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEchoing the report issued by the second synod in 2015, Francis\u2019 exhortation says that \u201cevery person regardless of sexual orientation\u201d should be treated with respect and consideration, while \u201cevery sign of unjust discrimination is to be carefully avoided, particularly any form of aggression and violence.\u201d\n\nBut in the next section, he states categorically that the church cannot countenance same-sex marriages or unions, citing the second synod\u2019s final report, which said \u201cthere are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar remotely analogous to God\u2019s plan for marriage and family.\u201d\n\nThe document \u201cdoes not inspire joy in L.G.B.T. Catholics and their supporters,\u201d said Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Ways Ministry, an advocacy group for gay Catholics.\n\n\u201cWhile not expecting a blessing on marriage for lesbian and gay couples, many were anticipating that Pope Francis would offer an affirming message to L.G.B.T. people, and not the same ill-informed comments,\u201d said Mr. DeBernardo, who is based in Maryland. \u201cWhere is the Pope Francis who embraced his gay former student and husband during his U.S. visit? Where is the Pope Francis who invited a transgender Spanish man for a personal meeting at the Vatican? This Pope Francis is hard to find in his latest text.\u201d\n\nBut this was the rare harsh passage in what is otherwise a fatherly letter to the church. Francis is releasing it during a year he has declared to be a Jubilee of Mercy. At every opportunity, he has been reminding Catholics that forgiveness and mercy are the heart of their faith.\n\n\u201cNo one can be condemned forever, because that is not the logic of the Gospel!\u201d the exhortation says. He adds that he is speaking not only of the divorced and remarried, \u201cbut of everyone, in whatever situation they find themselves.\u201d", "summary": "But Francis also makes clear the vision he wants local bishops and priests to follow: as a church that greets families with empathy and comfort rather than with unbending rules and rigid codes of conduct.R.
