But they have been encouraged by the example of Scotland, where Ms. Sturgeon on Monday said she would seek a referendum on independence.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Sturgeon is arguing that another referendum is required because Scotland\u2019s prospects have been changed by Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union, after last June\u2019s British referendum. While British voters overall decided to exit the European Union, 62 percent of voters in Scotland voted instead to remain.\n\nMr. Mas announced on Monday that he would appeal his sentence to the Spanish Supreme Court \u2014 but he also indicated that he was ready to take the case as far as European courts, given that he did not anticipate any appeal in Spain to be successful. Besides Mr. Mas, two other Catalan officials were also found guilty of disobedience on Monday for their part in staging the 2014 vote.\n\n\u201cThe law is not equal for everybody,\u201d Mr. Mas told reporters at a news conference in Barcelona. \u201cPeople are being persecuted for their ideas.\u201d\n\nIn Madrid, however, government officials presented the ruling as proof that no citizen is above Spanish law. Pablo Casado, a government spokesman, promised that \u201cthe government will ensure compliance with the law in Catalonia.\u201d\n\nIn the 2014 nonbinding ballot, almost 81 percent voted for independence, but only one-third of eligible voters took part.\n\nMs. Mas was replaced as government leader in early 2016, as part of a deal between the separatist parties that hold a majority of seats in the Catalan parliament. Since then, his party has also become entangled in major corruption cases over the payment of kickbacks for public works in Catalonia."}
