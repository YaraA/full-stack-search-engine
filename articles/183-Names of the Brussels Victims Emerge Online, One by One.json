But because the attacks occurred in the de facto capital of the European Union and the home of NATO\u2019s headquarters, more than the usual language and cultural barriers were present. People from as many as 40 nationalities were caught in the attacks, according to Didier Reynders, Belgium\u2019s foreign minister.\n\nCorners of social media became virtual bulletin boards. In one Facebook group, Bruxelles-profil Recherche Famille, messages arrived every few minutes on Wednesday.\n\nAmong the missing is Raghavendran Ganesan, an Indian citizen thought to have been commuting to his job at an information technology company at the time of the subway bombing that also took place Tuesday, according to a Facebook post by his brother. The brother, Chandrasekar Ganesan, said he had been trying to call him. \u201cSometimes it appears to ring, and sometimes it is busy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nS. Inbasekar, a representative of the Indian Embassy in Brussels, said in an email that officials were still trying to find Mr. Ganesan by checking hospitals.\n\nFriends and relatives of David Dixon, a Briton living in Brussels, spent the day posting photos of him on social media. Mr. Dixon, who normally took the subway to work, sent a text to an aunt to say he was safe after the airport was bombed, the BBC reported. He is a contractor for Euroclear, a financial services company.\n\n\u201cWe are in touch with his partner and continue to coordinate with the authorities in locating David,\u201d Tristan Peniston-Bird, a Euroclear spokesman, wrote in an email on Wednesday.\n\nThose close to Mr. Dixon must also grapple with news inquiries from around the globe. Emily Sutcliffe, a niece of Mr. Dixon\u2019s partner, Charlotte Sutcliffe, wrote an open message to journalists: \u201cWe would appreciate all help in finding David Dixon and reuniting him with my Aunty and his son. There is no comment from me or any of my family that can help in the search, that\u2019s in the hands of Belgian authorities.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Facebook, family and friends, including Ms. Eskinazi, posted several notices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso at the airport were Stephanie and Justin Shults, an American couple working as accountants in Brussels, who had just dropped off Ms. Shults\u2019s mother, Carolyn Moore, for a flight home to Kentucky. Soon after Ms. Moore entered the security line, the bombs detonated.\n\n\u201cShe was not injured in the blast, but chaos ensued and she couldn\u2019t find Justin or Stephanie,\u201d said Levi Sutton, a half brother of Mr. Shults.\n\n\u201cWe tried calling the embassy, the Red Cross, hospitals,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re unable to get any information. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nMark C. Toner, a deputy spokesman for the State Department, said in a statement that about a dozen Americans had been wounded, but that the department was not aware of any Americans who had been killed.\n\n\u201cWe must emphasize that a number of U.S. citizens remain unaccounted for, and the Kingdom of Belgium has not yet released nationality information for reported fatalities,\u201d he said.\n\nOther deaths have been confirmed through Facebook. Olivier Delespesse was killed in the subway bombing, according to a post from his employer, the Federation of Wallonia-Brussels.\n\n\u201cHe was always smiling, always happy,\u201d Olivier Dradin, a co-worker, said in an interview. \u201cHe was very playful, and someone who was deeply interested in people \u2014 the opposite of the kind of person who remains cold and unapproachable behind a desk.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Fernando Tapia Coral confirmed the death of his sister, Adelma Tapia Ruiz, a Peruvian who had twin daughters.", "summary": "But because the attacks occurred in the de facto capital of the European Union and the home of NATO\u2019s headquarters, more than the usual language and cultural barriers were present.
