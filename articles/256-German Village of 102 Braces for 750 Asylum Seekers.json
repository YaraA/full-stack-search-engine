It is also straining German politics broadly, creating deep divisions in the conservative camp of Chancellor Angela Merkel and energizing a constellation of extremist groups that feel their time has come.\n\n100 Miles DENMARK SWEDEN Baltic Sea North Sea Sumte Hamburg Berlin POLAND GERMANY NETHERLANDS Elbe Former East German border BELGIUM LUXEMBOURG CZECH REPUBLIC FRANCE\n\nOne of the few people, in fact, who seem enthusiastic about the plan for Sumte is Holger Niemann, 32, an admirer of Hitler and the lone neo-Nazi on the elected district council. He rejoices at the opportunities the migrant crisis has offered.\n\n\u201cIt is bad for the people, but politically it is good for me,\u201d Mr. Niemann said of the plan, which would leave the German villagers outnumbered by migrants by more than seven to one.\n\nGermans face \u201cthe destruction of our genetic heritage\u201d and risk becoming \u201ca gray mishmash,\u201d Mr. Niemann added, predicting that public anxiety over Ms. Merkel\u2019s open-armed welcome to refugees would help demolish a postwar political consensus in Germany built on moderation and compromise.\n\nUnlike those in other European countries, far-right parties in Germany have had little success in national elections, and remain firmly rejected by the overwhelming majority of Germans.\n\nReinhold Schlemmer, a former Communist who served as the mayor here before and immediately after the collapse of East Germany, said people like Mr. Niemann would \u201chave been put in prison right away\u201d during the Communist era.\n\n\u201cNow they can stand up and preach,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say this is democracy, but I don\u2019t think it is democracy to let Nazis say what they want.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schlemmer is among those concerned that extremists are exploiting widespread concerns, even in the political mainstream, over absorbing vast numbers of refugees, as the influx tests Germany\u2019s capacity to cope.\n\nPhoto\n\nSumte has no shops, no police station, no school. The initial number of arrivals was, in fact, reduced to avoid straining the local sewage system and give time for new pumps to be installed.\n\n\u201cWe have zero infrastructure here for so many people,\u201d Mr. Fabel, the mayor, said.\n\nAs the federal government desperately scrambles to find shelter for the refugees before winter sets in, it is assigning quotas to each of Germany\u2019s 16 L\u00e4nder, or states, based on factors like economic strength and population.\n\nInitially, the migrants were housed in renovated homes, then in gymnasiums, military bases and old schools, but as obvious shelters run out, the authorities are hunting for any free space they can find, like the 23 empty office buildings in Sumte.\n\nDirk Hammer, a Sumte resident, said that he felt sympathy for the refugees, but that he feared the sheer number of people dumped with little warning in places like this could offer \u201can ideal platform for the far right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get stomachaches from fear of what is going to happen \u2014 not just here but in the whole of Germany,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least for the moment, the tolerant values of people like Mr. Hammer have proved resilient, even as Mr. Niemann and like-minded neo-Nazis deride such views as alien imports imposed by the United States and other World War II victors.\n\nWhen Mr. Niemann took the floor at a meeting in October between villagers and regional officials responsible for migrants, Mr. Hammer snatched away the microphone.\n\n\u201cWe have to take a clear stand against these people,\u201d Mr. Hammer said later, noting that his family had lived in Sumte for 400 years. He dismissed Mr. Niemann, who lives in a village a couple of miles down the road, as a disruptive outsider.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Hammer himself initially reacted with horror when he heard of plans to move refugees into the empty office complex, built by a now-defunct debt collection company. He wrote an angry open letter on Facebook expressing his fury as a longtime supporter of Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party who felt betrayed.\n\n\u201cIf we are being used as a dumping ground, this shows the situation is out of hand,\u201d Mr. Hammer said in an interview at his family\u2019s home, a modernized farmhouse.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he knew people who \u201care not far right, but who are afraid and their fear is being exploited.\u201d\n\nUnable to speak at the village meeting last month, Mr. Niemann and a handful of followers heckled speakers who voiced sympathy for refugees, and waved banners demanding an end to \u201casylum terror.\u201d\n\nAt a follow-up meeting between officials and villagers on Wednesday, Mr. Niemann stayed silent, taking notes.\n\nAn assertion by a senior regional police official that Sumte did not need a permanent police presence prompted one villager to jump to his feet and shout, \u201cOf course we need protection.\u201d But the discussion was civil and devoid of inflammatory outbursts.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\n\u201cPeople are just tired and think that so long as we have enough food in the fridge we are all fine,\u201d Mr. Niemann said in an interview, frustrated that his efforts to stir resistance to the refugee relocation had gained little traction in Sumte.\n\nOther extremists in the area have resorted to blunter methods to get their message across. Shortly after the news first broke of the plans to move 1,000 refugees to Sumte, unidentified arsonists attacked a smaller refugee center in the nearby town of Boizenburg, setting fires and smashing windows.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Niemann said he rejected violence, but a far-right coalition he represents on the district council includes two of Germany\u2019s most belligerent groups, the National Democratic Party, better known by its German acronym N.P.D., and Die Rechte, which was last week linked by authorities in Bavaria to a cache of weapons assembled in an alleged plot to attack refugees.\n\n\u201cThere are individuals who cannot be controlled at all times,\u201d said Mr. Niemann, a car washer.\n\nAsked whether he considered himself a neo-Nazi, he said, \u201cNo, I am National Socialist\u201d \u2014 in other words, a real Nazi. \u201cWe are not extremists, but people have become so soft that we seem extreme,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Fabel, the mayor, insisted that Sumte, despite its unease, was open-minded and hospitable, and was now focused on making the refugee holding camp work.\n\n\u201cMany families here suffered during the war, so they will think twice about joining extremists,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he realized that there was no point in trying to block the plan when, at the initial meeting, he asked Mr. G\u00f6tz, the regional official in charge of finding places for migrants, whether Sumte had any choice. \u201cYou have two options,\u201d he said he was told. \u201cYes, or yes.\u201d Mr. G\u00f6tz declined to be interviewed.\n\nThe asylum seekers will stay in Sumte only as long as it takes to process their applications for refugee status. But those who move on will eventually be replaced by new arrivals, as the vast stream of refugees and migrants shows no signs of slowing.\n\n\u201cLife here is going to change,\u201d the mayor said.", "summary": "Germans face \u201cthe destruction of our genetic heritage\u201d and risk becoming \u201ca gray mishmash,\u201d Mr. Niemann added, predicting that public anxiety over Ms. Merkel\u2019s open-armed welcome to refugees would help demolish a postwar political consensus in Germany built on moderation and compromise.
