{"title": "Man Arrested as \u2018Third Bomber\u2019 in Brussels Attack Is Freed; Hunt Is Renewed", "authors": ["Andrew Higgins", "Kimiko De Freytas-Tamura"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/world/europe/brussels-attacks.html", "body": "To add to the confusion, Eric Van der Sijpt, a spokesman for the prosecutor\u2019s office, said Monday that the charges against Mr. Cheffou remained for the moment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that he\u2019s innocent. That we do not do,\u201d Mr. Van der Sijpt said in telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s that he\u2019s no longer needed in prison. But there are two different things. Preventative custody has nothing to do with the actual investigations or the charges brought.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nHe added that the prosecutor would decide at the end of the investigation whether to prosecute Mr. Cheffou and that only then would the status of the charges against him be decided.\n\nIn a separate statement, the prosecutor\u2019s office said Monday that three men detained in and around Brussels on Sunday had been charged with participating in the activities of a terrorist group. It was not clear if they were connected to the attacks last Tuesday.\n\nThe disarray over Mr. Cheffou followed a catalog of mishaps and errors that last week prompted Belgium\u2019s ministers of justice and the interior to offer their resignations \u2014 they were asked to stay on \u2014 and led to angry questioning of the government during a parliamentary hearing on Belgium\u2019s response to terrorism.\n\nReflecting public outrage over mounting evidence that the authorities had ignored or misinterpreted signals that might have prevented the attacks, Le Soir, a leading French-language Belgian newspaper, last week splashed a damning indictment of the security apparatus across its front page: \u201cSerious mistakes.\u201d La Capitale, another newspaper, was blunter still: \u201cChaos,\u201d its front page screamed.\n\nSince then, dismay has only increased, with rival French- and Dutch-speaking politicians trading accusations on Monday over who was responsible for allowing several hundred hooligans to storm a makeshift shrine to the victims of the terrorist attacks in front of the old Brussels stock exchange on Sunday. The French speakers denounced the hooligans, who had assembled on Saturday in the town of Vilvoorde, north of Brussels, as Dutch-speaking fascists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen, just as the hooligan furor was reaching its peak, the federal prosecutor\u2019s office announced that Mr. Cheffou, named only as Fay\u00e7al C. in official statements, had been released. And with that the best hope so far of piecing together the terrorist plot and perhaps identifying other plots in the works had suddenly evaporated. The three other people so far identified as directly involved in last week\u2019s attacks \u2014 two brothers, Ibrahim and Khalid el-Bakraoui, and the suspected bomb-maker, Najim Laachraoui \u2014 are all dead.\n\n\u201cThe evidence that had led to the arrest of the man named Fay\u00e7al C. was not substantiated by the evolution of the ongoing investigation,\u201d Thierry Werts, another spokesman for the federal prosecutor, said in a statement. \u201cConsequently, he has been freed by the investigative judge.\u201d\n\nBelgians writing on Twitter in Dutch expressed outrage over the latest turn of events. \u201cWe got him but it was the wrong guy #painful,\u201d said one. Another fumed: \u201cCheffou the new hero of the Left on Twitter. I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d Others, mostly writing in French, pilloried the authorities for having arrested Mr. Cheffou in the first place.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Mr. Bakraoui\u2019s younger brother, Khalid, blew himself up at 9:11 a.m. at the Maelbeek subway station.\n\nThe death toll from the attacks rose on Monday to 35, as the authorities reported that four victims who had been hospitalized died from their injuries. The toll, which was reported by the Belgian health minister, Maggie De Block, did not include the three suicide bombers.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, Yvan Mayeur, the mayor of the City of Brussels, the central borough of the 19 municipalities that make up the Belgian capital, said that the taxi driver had identified Mr. Cheffou in a police photo lineup, but that the authorities were still waiting for DNA confirmation that he was the bomber.\n\nMr. Mayeur added that he did not know whether Mr. Cheffou had been involved in terrorism, but did know him to be a local troublemaker who had repeatedly disrupted a camp of refugees in Parc Maximilien, near the Gare du Nord railway station.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Cheffou, he said, often harangued and got into fights with volunteers from Belgian nongovernmental organizations, denouncing them for not being Muslims and urging migrants in their care to rebel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe tried to get the refugees to turn against NGOs because they were \u2018nonbelievers,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Mayeur recalled.\n\nIn September, after prosecutors declined to intervene, the mayor issued a municipal order barring Mr. Cheffou from the migrant encampment, which was later shut down.\n\nHis written order accused Mr. Cheffou of wreaking havoc at the camp, alleging that four of his underlings had tried in September to force a 17-year-old female migrant to spend the night with \u201cthe chief.\u201d She escaped with help from volunteers. It also said he had denounced Belgian workers at the camp as being infidels, collaborators with the state and, in one case, in the pay of Israel.", "summary": "Since then, dismay has only increased, with rival French- and Dutch-speaking politicians trading accusations on Monday over who was responsible for allowing several hundred hooligans to storm a makeshift shrine to the victims of the terrorist attacks in front of the old Brussels stock exchange on Sunday.\u201cThe evidence that had led to the arrest of the man named Fay\u00e7al C. was not substantiated by the evolution of the ongoing investigation,\u201d Thierry Werts, another spokesman for the federal prosecutor, said in a statement.In an interview on Sunday, Yvan Mayeur, the mayor of the City of Brussels, the central borough of the 19 municipalities that make up the Belgian capital, said that the taxi driver had identified Mr. Cheffou in a police photo lineup, but that the authorities were still waiting for DNA confirmation that he was the bomber.Mr. Mayeur added that he did not know whether Mr. Cheffou had been involved in terrorism, but did know him to be a local troublemaker who had repeatedly disrupted a camp of refugees in Parc Maximilien, near the Gare du Nord railway station.His written order accused Mr. Cheffou of wreaking havoc at the camp, alleging that four of his underlings had tried in September to force a 17-year-old female migrant to spend the night with \u201cthe chief.\u201d She escaped with help from volunteers."}
