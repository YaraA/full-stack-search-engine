He has a toddler to support.\n\nAbdallah Saadi says he also lost 13 close friends, and has been traveling from funeral to funeral. His parents, he said, are devastated.\n\nPhoto\n\nSitting in a cafe not far from La Belle \u00c9quipe, Abdallah Saadi said his family had been victimized twice during the attacks. \u201cThe terrorists killed my sisters, and as Muslims we are double victims of these people because they create a hatred of Islam,\u201d he said, voicing fears of a backlash against France\u2019s estimated six million Muslims, a majority of whom, he stressed, are proud French citizens like himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThese hooligans, they aren\u2019t Muslims, they kill everyone,\u201d he continued. \u201cI have hate for these people, they are disgusting. What dignity? What heroism? They shoot a girl in the back.\u201d\n\nThe Saadi family \u2014 eight brothers and sisters \u2014 originate from Menzel Bourguiba, a small port town in Tunisia, and grew up in an industrial estate in Le Creusot, a town in Burgundy.\n\nMr. Saadi, a former fabric salesman, credits his Tunisian-born parents and his service in the French military for inculcating him with French Republican values of egalitarianism. He said his family was a powerful example of integration.\n\nHe said his parents came to France in the 1960s in search of economic opportunity. Both were illiterate. But he said his father, a stone mason, worked long days at a factory, and instilled in his children the importance of hard work and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cMy father went to work in rain, sun, winter, even when he was sick,\u201d Mr. Saadi said. \u201cWe wore hand-me-downs \u2014 no Nike or Adidas. But we all wanted for nothing, and we were brought up to love \u2014 not to hate. My father instilled in us that if you were North African in France, you needed to work even harder to succeed.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHis sister Hodda, the manager of La Belle \u00c9quipe, had internalized their father\u2019s work ethic. She had just gotten back with her former boyfriend and had seldom been happier, he said.\n\nPossessed of an artistic sensibility, she enjoyed photography, opera and doing fashion makeovers for her friends using inexpensive vintage clothing, her brother said.\n\nHe said Hodda Saadi was honest to a fault, natural and maternal. She meticulously sent money to her parents every month. She loved to travel and had lived in Italy and spoke fluent Italian and English.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He pulled out a piece of paper with her meticulous loopy cursive writing that he had retrieved from her apartment as a memento, a journal of her private musings in which she had written \u201ctheft is the worst form of treason.\u201d\n\nIf Hodda was the maternal sister, Halima was the coquettish one, lively and fun, an amateur chef who enjoyed cooking Tunisian dishes, and had a mane of big curls and a joie de vivre that was contagious, according to their brother.\n\nShe was visiting Paris from Dakar, Senegal, where she lived with her husband and two young sons, ages 3 and 7. Mr. Saadi said that Halima, who had worked in a hospital in Paris before she moved to Senegal, was devoted to her children.\n\n\u201cHer children were the center of her life, and they don\u2019t yet understand what has happened to their mother,\u201d he said.\n\nHalima, he said, was the one all his brothers and sisters turned to when they were sad. \u201cYou could tell her anything.\u201d\n\nAs the Saadi family struggles to cope with their grief, La Belle \u00c9quipe\u2019s owner, Mr. Reibenberg, who just buried his wife, has been encouraging his friends and fellow survivors to return to the cafes and bistros of the 11th Arrondissement as a potent affirmation of hope and resistance in the face of terrorism.\n\nOn the Sunday after the attacks, he led a march through the quarter, clutching a white rose. \u201cIt\u2019s a place filled with life, this little corner,\u201d he told the crowd.\n\nSpeaking on France 2 television, Mr. Reibenberg said closing La Belle \u00c9quipe was out of the question.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe must go to concerts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must sit on terraces. We can still smile with scars on our face. We will lick our wounds and then will all live with our scars; it doesn\u2019t stop us from being happy. There\u2019s no choice.\u201d", "summary": "Among the dead were the bistro\u2019s manager, Hodda Saadi, 35, a free-spirited and determined woman with a wide smile and a passion for yoga and vintage clothing who was celebrating her birthday that night.
