This implies that we teach our children to respect different religions and philosophical convictions. What they all share is the desire to give meaning to life, to respect others and to be open toward them. Respecting these common rules also implies zero tolerance toward hate speech. It means fighting, day after day, all forms of stigmatization and segregation, and helping people who are drawn to fanatical indoctrination to resist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbdoullah C. appears to have been one of them. He is \u201csuspected to have had several contacts\u201d with Hasna Aitboulahcen, a 26-year-old cousin of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, the Belgian believed to have been the chief planner of the attacks, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
