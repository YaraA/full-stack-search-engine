On Monday, they are to be presented with the Legion d\u2019Honneur, France\u2019s highest honor, by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\n\u201cWe are now faced with unpredictable terrorism,\u201d said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security consultant and terrorism expert. \u201cTerrorists henceforth will be choosing soft targets, those where there is little security,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why he chose a train \u2014 because there is little security.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, French antiterrorism officials were continuing to interrogate the suspect. A lawyer who has spoken with him insisted to French news media the man was \u201cbewildered\u201d by accusations of terrorism, saying that he merely wanted to rob the passengers. But those explanations were dismissed by the authorities, as well as by one of the young American servicemen who tackled him, Alek Skarlatos, who said at a news conference that given the amount of ammunition the man was carrying, robbery could not have been his motive.\n\nThe shortcomings of the French security list were highlighted on Sunday by Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front Party here. Ms. Le Pen called for the expulsion from France of terrorism suspects on the security threat list, saying there were \u201cserious weaknesses\u201d with the system. Some antiterrorism experts agreed that control of the movements of suspect individuals with residency permits across European borders \u2014 including those on lists \u2014 was weak. That played into the inherent weaknesses in controlling rail passengers, they said.\n\nBecause of the European Union\u2019s borderless frontiers, there are no \u201csystematic controls on Europeans\u201d or those holding resident cards, \u201conly on foreigners,\u201d Mr. Brisard said. And that is \u201cthe real problem,\u201d he said.\n\nWith determined jihadists, 40 million passengers daily and 100,000 trains, securing Europe\u2019s rail networks is a challenge unlikely to be met anytime soon, if ever, according to security experts.\n\nThe problem is that train stations \u2014 3,000 of them in France alone \u2014 are open spaces, largely uncontrolled, where nonpassengers can mingle freely with those getting on board. Baggage is checked in only a few places, and for a very few trains \u2014 for the cross-Channel Eurostar, and for some trains in Spain after the terrorist attacks there that killed around 200 people in 2004.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEurope\u2019s trains, stations and thousands of miles of train tracks are very different from the tightly controlled space of airports, the security experts said. Trains are on the way to becoming the logical soft target of choice, they said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For terrorists, \u201cFor years their symbolic target was air transport, but that has become very difficult,\u201d Trains are \u201can evident target,\u201d he said. \u201cMillions of people would say, \u2018It could have been me,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Monnet said. \u201cThe question was not whether, but when.\u201d\n\nThe half-dozen big train stations in Paris are like villages, with a constant stream of unchecked humanity pouring through them every day. Decades old, they were designed with none of today\u2019s security problems in mind. Sporadic patrols by armed soldiers constitute a check, but a very limited one, say the experts. One million passengers a day take the French high-speed train alone, and three million take the suburban train network.\n\n\u201cAccess to the platforms over the whole network, to train stations, these are open spaces. It\u2019s not like airports,\u201d said Marc Ivaldi, a European transport expert at the Institute of Industrial Economics, in Toulouse.\n\n\u201cEven if you are not traveling, you have access. It is a huge space, and one that is very difficult to make secure,\u201d Mr. Ivaldi said. \u201cYou could put cameras in, but you can\u2019t imagine a system like airports.\u201d\n\nTo install airport-style metal detector gates in train stations \u201cwould totally block the flow\u201d of rail traffic, said Mr. Brisard.\n\n\u201cYou are dealing very much with a popular expectation that you can go to the station and get and go wherever it is you need to be quickly and without too much hassle,\u201d said Christopher Irwin, vice chairman of the European Passengers\u2019 Federation, a passenger advocacy group based in Belgium.\n\nAdding new security checkpoints and additional layers of passenger and baggage screening, experts said, would not only extend passengers\u2019 travel time but would also stretch the physical capacity of urban train stations. \u201cYou can try screening everyone, but that is unlikely to be sustainable,\u201d Mr. Irwin said. \u201cYou probably couldn\u2019t keep the transport system working if you did that. Stations simply haven\u2019t got the space to accommodate the queuing that would be required.\u201d\n\nUntil now, the only train services in Europe that systematically screen passengers and their luggage are the Eurostar, which connects Britain with France and Belgium, as well as some high-speed lines in Spain. Elsewhere, security systems operate on a more random \u2014 and often less visible \u2014 basis, relying on networks of surveillance cameras, uniformed or undercover police officers and bomb-sniffing dogs.\n\nThe most plausible scenario is some return to the situation prevailing in France in the mid-1990s after a series of Islamist attacks on trains and train stations. For a brief period, military personnel patrolled inside the trains and baggage was checked. Mr. Brisard noted that such patrols have, potentially, a much more dissuasive effect than the mere sight of armed soldiers in train stations.", "summary": "A lawyer who has spoken with him insisted to French news media the man was \u201cbewildered\u201d by accusations of terrorism, saying that he merely wanted to rob the passengers.But those explanations were dismissed by the authorities, as well as by one of the young American servicemen who tackled him, Alek Skarlatos, who said at a news conference that given the amount of ammunition the man was carrying, robbery could not have been his motive.Some antiterrorism experts agreed that control of the movements of suspect individuals with residency permits across European borders \u2014 including those on lists \u2014 was weak.Until now, the only train services in Europe that systematically screen passengers and their luggage are the Eurostar, which connects Britain with France and Belgium, as well as some high-speed lines in Spain.Elsewhere, security systems operate on a more random \u2014 and often less visible \u2014 basis, relying on networks of surveillance cameras, uniformed or undercover police officers and bomb-sniffing dogs."}
