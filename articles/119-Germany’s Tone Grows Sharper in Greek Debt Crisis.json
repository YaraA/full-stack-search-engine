{"title": "Germany\u2019s Tone Grows Sharper in Greek Debt Crisis", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/world/europe/eurozone-greece-debt-germany.html", "body": "Speaking in Berlin after meeting with members of the center-left Social Democratic Party, Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands, the leader of the eurozone finance ministers, criticized Mr. Sch\u00e4uble for raising the suggestion of a Greek exit. \u201cIf you reach an agreement after such long and hard talks, you have to stand behind it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that goes for all sides.\u201d\n\nBut within Germany, there is still strong backing for being tough on Greece, or even seeing it leave the euro rather than undermine the common currency\u2019s chances of thriving in the future. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble made his remarks in a radio interview hours after the Greek Parliament voted reluctantly to approve the first set of austerity measures demanded by its European creditors in return for a chance to negotiate the new bailout package, its third in five years. And his remarks came as some Greek officials asserted that he has been in favor of Greece leaving the euro all along.\n\n\u201cIt is beginning to look like a very dirty game that he is playing,\u201d Johannes Kahrs, a Social Democratic lawmaker, said of Mr. Sch\u00e4uble.\n\nMr. Sch\u00e4uble emphasized that no one was trying to dictate to Greece how it should proceed. But he made a case that forgiving a substantial amount of Greece\u2019s public debt of more than 300 billion euros, or about $330 billion, was not compatible with membership in the eurozone.\n\n\u201cWe have not said that we will impose this, we can\u2019t, we don\u2019t want to, and no one has suggested it, but it would perhaps be the better way for Greece,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said in the interview with Deutschlandfunk radio on Thursday when asked about allowing Greece to take a time out from the eurozone.\n\nVideo\n\nHe also questioned whether the package Greece was seeking would be enough to bring the country\u2019s financial situation back into a manageable position. \u201cNobody knows in the moment how it is supposed to happen without debt relief, but everyone knows that debt relief is not possible within the eurozone,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis position appeared to be based on European rules that are not interpreted as strictly by other nations, or by the International Monetary Fund, which called this week for deeper debt relief for Greece than Europe has been willing to consider. European rules for membership in the euro, such as those on budget deficits, are routinely skirted or broken.\n\nMr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s hard-line views on austerity and debt are not limited to him, or even to Germany. Much of Eastern Europe and a number of conservative northern countries share his view that Greece has been profligate and should get further aid only under the strictest conditions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Supporters point to Ireland, Portugal and Spain as nations that have bounced back to varying degrees after austerity programs; critics point to Greece, which has remained economically troubled.\n\nGermany\u2019s finance minister since the Greek crisis erupted in 2010, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble is known as resilient and forceful, with a Germanic embrace of the rules and a Nietzschean attitude of \u201cThat which does not kill us, makes us stronger.\u201d He has held offices in four governments, serving as Helmut Kohl\u2019s chief of staff and Ms. Merkel\u2019s interior and finance minister. Even an attempt on his life in 1990 that left him using a wheelchair kept him from the political stage for less than a year.\n\nMs. Merkel has ruled out forgiving any of Greece\u2019s debt but has left the door open to a new negotiation over extending the payment terms or reducing interest rates to help bring down Greece\u2019s annual debt payments. But the I.M.F. and some other countries, including the United States, are pressing for Germany to lead Europe in doing more.\n\n\u201cI think the I.M.F. raising the debt sustainability issue as clearly as they did, the United States making clear that sustainability had to be dealt with, was a helpful contribution to the conversation, because without dealing with some form of debt restructuring, this problem will just come right back,\u201d a senior United States Treasury official said on Thursday, as Treasury Secretary Jack Lew traveled through Europe.\n\nStill, some conservative German lawmakers have indicated ahead of Friday\u2019s vote reservations about whether they believe Greece fully meets the conditions required to tap aid from the European Union\u2019s bailout fund, much less qualifies for debt relief.\n\nAt a vote to extend the previous bailout package in February, a record number of dissenters from the chancellor\u2019s conservative camp showed growing impatience with the anti-austerity government in Athens, with 29 voting against it. An additional 109 among about 310 conservative lawmakers indicated reservations, although they went along with the vote.\n\nMr. Sch\u00e4uble signaled on Thursday that it might be difficult to reduce the burden of Greece\u2019s debt payments sufficiently without some debt forgiveness \u2014 a step he said could not be taken while Greece is a member of the currency union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe more difficult question will be to reach sustainability of the debt, whether a package that is large enough can be agreed upon without any debt reduction,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said. \u201cThen we are back in the situation that debt reduction is not allowed in the eurozone.\u201d\n\nSome analysts said Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s discussion of a \u201ctemporary\u201d exit from the eurozone for Greece was a veiled attempt to push it out of the 19-member currency union for good. Sony Kapoor, an analyst at Re-Define, a research group, recalled Mr. Sch\u00e4uble expressing similar thoughts in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind couching it in temporary terms is to make it sound less onerous and a bit more compliant with the legal situation,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said. \u201cThere is nothing as permanent as a temporary divorce.\u201d", "summary": "Speaking in Berlin after meeting with members of the center-left Social Democratic Party, Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands, the leader of the eurozone finance ministers, criticized Mr. Sch\u00e4uble for raising the suggestion of a Greek exit.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble made his remarks in a radio interview hours after the Greek Parliament voted reluctantly to approve the first set of austerity measures demanded by its European creditors in return for a chance to negotiate the new bailout package, its third in five years.His position appeared to be based on European rules that are not interpreted as strictly by other nations, or by the International Monetary Fund, which called this week for deeper debt relief for Greece than Europe has been willing to consider.raising the debt sustainability issue as clearly as they did, the United States making clear that sustainability had to be dealt with, was a helpful contribution to the conversation, because without dealing with some form of debt restructuring, this problem will just come right back,\u201d a senior United States Treasury official said on Thursday, as Treasury Secretary Jack Lew traveled through Europe.Still, some conservative German lawmakers have indicated ahead of Friday\u2019s vote reservations about whether they believe Greece fully meets the conditions required to tap aid from the European Union\u2019s bailout fund, much less qualifies for debt relief."}
