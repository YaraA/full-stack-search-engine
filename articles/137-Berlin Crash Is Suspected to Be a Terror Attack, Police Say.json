{"title": "Berlin Crash Is Suspected to Be a Terror Attack, Police Say", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy", "Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/world/europe/berlin-christmas-market-truck-crash.html", "body": "\u201cPeople were sitting holding their heads, there were pools of blood on the floor,\u201d said Emma Rushton, a British tourist, who was visiting Berlin for the first time and who watched as the truck crushed a stand right in front of her.\n\nThough it was never clear if the driver in Nice was linked to the Islamic State, the group\u2019s exhortations to run over its enemies seemed to have inspired the killer, who had a long history of disturbed and violent behavior.\n\nIf the Berlin attack turns out to have been carried out by someone who entered Germany as a migrant, it could produce yet another political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel. Ms. Merkel has been sharply criticized for allowing one million migrants to enter the country, often without any screening or background checks.\n\nHeiko Maas, Germany\u2019s justice minister, said that federal prosecutors had taken over the investigation of the episode, an indication that the authorities suspected terrorism.\n\nAndreas Geisel, Berlin\u2019s top security official, initially insisted it could have been either an attack or an accident. And Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, Germany\u2019s interior minister, refused to use the word \u201cattack\u201d in an interview with the public broadcaster ARD.\n\n\u201cThe words we choose have a psychological effect on the whole country,\u201d Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said. \u201cI am consciously avoiding using the word \u2018attack,\u2019 although there is a lot that points in that direction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOfficials in Washington were less cautious in their characterization, based on similar attacks that the Islamic State seems to have inspired before, like the one in Nice.\n\n\u201cThe United States condemns in the strongest terms what appears to have been a terrorist attack on a Christmas market in Berlin,\u201d the National Security Council said in a statement.\n\nSince Ms. Merkel\u2019s decision in the summer of 2015 to throw open Germany\u2019s borders to migrants and refugees, her country has grown jittery and concerned by security threats and the challenges of integrating the newcomers.\n\nAn attack on a Christmas market would be likely to provoke particular ire. Christmas markets are a beloved German tradition that open on the first Sunday of Advent and attract thousands of visitors throughout December until Christmas Eve.\n\nComing only days before Christmas, the crash left Germans numb and unnerved after months marked by a steady uptick of episodes, increasing in lethality.\n\nVideo\n\nThe year opened with scores of sexual assaults in Cologne for which migrants were blamed and reports of a threatened attack on Munich\u2019s main railway station.\n\nSince February, four smaller-scale terrorist attacks have been carried out in Germany by people who said they were motivated by the Islamic State, two of them refugees.\n\nOne refugee injured five passengers on a train near W\u00fcrzburg, and the other wounded 15 people when he detonated a bomb in his backpack near a concert in Ansbach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe attacks have helped to feed a growing populist movement and have helped the far-right, nationalist Alternative for Germany party gain strength, with representation in half of the country\u2019s 16 states.\n\nMs. Merkel said on Monday she was in contact with Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re, the interior minister, and the mayor of Berlin, Michael M\u00fcller.\n\n\u201cWe mourn the dead and hope the many injured can be helped,\u201d the chancellor\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Twitter.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

He\u2019s my cousin and I\u2019ve known him for ages. I trust him completely,\u201d Mr. Zurawski said. \u201cHe\u2019s very dedicated to his job. He\u2019s a very experienced driver and always takes great care of the equipment.\u201d\n\nMr. Zurawski said he had spoken to his cousin around noon and everything was fine, but he added that his cousin\u2019s wife had been unable to get a hold of him when she called him about four hours later.\n\n\u201cThat was already a bad sign,\u201d he said.\n\nFirefighters at the site could be seen surrounding the trailer of the truck, parked on the square at the base of the tower of the church. Emergency vehicles surrounded the square, which sits between two main streets that run through the heart of West Berlin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible to see this scene,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we did not want to see in Berlin.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cPeople were sitting holding their heads, there were pools of blood on the floor,\u201d said Emma Rushton, a British tourist, who was visiting Berlin for the first time and who watched as the truck crushed a stand right in front of her.
