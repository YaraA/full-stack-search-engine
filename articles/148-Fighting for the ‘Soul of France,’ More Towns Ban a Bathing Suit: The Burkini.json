In conservative Muslim countries, women would never go to a beach with men, much less go swimming, since even in the burkini the wet cloth sticks to a woman\u2019s body, outlining her curves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is a good news in a way because it means Muslim women who didn\u2019t used to enjoy that day at the beach or at the pool are now taking part, they are socializing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Center Against Islamophobia challenged the ban in Cannes, and lost, but is appealing that decision. Meanwhile, the Council of State, which determines whether such bans meet French legal requirements, is reviewing the local ordinances and is expected to rule on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the more important and dangerous point, Mr. Muhammad said, is that there is no legal definition of the burkini. Typically many Muslim women, who do not want to spend 40 to 125 euros for a burkini, wear a T-shirt and long pants. Some even take off their hijab, others put on a bathing cap.\n\nHe said that six Muslim women who complained to his center in the past week were asked to leave public beaches even though they were not wearing burkinis.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Violators of the ban are asked to leave the beach and can be fined 38 euros, or about $42.\n\nOn Saturday, brawls broke out at a beach in Corsica after some beachgoers began taking photographs of Muslim women wearing burkinis, prompting the mayor of the town of Sisco to ban the full-body bathing suits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe slippery slope of such restrictions first came into view with a law in 2004 that banned the wearing of overt religious symbols in public primary and secondary schools. It included wearing the Jewish kippa, large crosses and the hijab, but affected disproportionately those wearing the hijab because there are few parochial schools for Muslims, so they have no choice but to go to state schools.\n\nBut in colleges, the hijab and other signs of religious faith are acceptable, and there is no law against them in daily life unless a person works for the French government, where all signs of religious practice are prohibited.\n\nIn 2010, the Parliament approved a law banning in public any clothing that hides the face. While worded generally, the debate focused on the full-face veil, sometimes called the burqa. The reason given was public safety.\n\nMore recently politicians have begun to compete in further regulating clothing worn by Muslim women. One of the candidates for the nomination of the right-leaning Republican party, Mr. Sarkozy, has called for banning the hijab also in university settings.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

It dates from the bitter wars here between Protestants and Catholics and the later efforts by many to curtail the powers of the Catholic Church, which had long been allied with the monarchy and conservative political forces in France.\n\nAlthough politicians often cite la\u00efcit\u00e9 as a reason for prohibiting Muslim and other religious attire, in fact that is a misconception, said Nicolas Cad\u00e8ne, the spokesman for the government\u2019s Observatory on La\u00efcit\u00e9.\n\n\u201cDuring crises, there are crises of passion, of looking to your own experiences, of retreating, of rising fear,\u201d he said. \u201cOne must not overreach in such a climate. We need to calm down the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne should not exploit la\u00efcit\u00e9 for partisan ends and to stigmatize people,\u201d he added.", "summary": "Laurence Rossignol, a feminist and the Socialist minister for families, children and women\u2019s rights, called the burkini \u201cprofoundly archaic\u201d and \u201cnot just a new kind of bathing attire,\u201d but a garment with a deeper meaning.
