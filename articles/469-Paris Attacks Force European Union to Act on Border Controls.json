But the system can work only if its external borders are policed and protected, and it is obvious to all that Europe has failed to do so.\n\nArnaud Danjean, a member of the European Parliament and a former security official and diplomat from France, put it bluntly: \u201cIf by the end of the year necessary measures to reinforce external border controls and to check passports of Schengen citizens are not implemented, I think Schengen is dead.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, he said, \u201cmany countries will come back in January and say we need another system, and until we have one, we will adopt permanent border controls.\u201d\n\nFrench proposals for tighter controls were first made after Islamist radicals attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket in January.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut they were stalled by inaction and by concerns over data privacy in the European Parliament, raised particularly by Germany and the newer members from Central and Eastern Europe, which have been largely untouched by terrorism.\n\nOn Friday, however, the ministers gave their backing to measures demanded by France this week that included tightening external borders by extending checks to more people who can usually enter, and move freely within, the Schengen area.\n\nPhoto\n\nStrengthening controls at external borders is \u201cindispensable for the protection of European citizens,\u201d Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said at a news conference.\n\nOverhauling the Schengen rules would mean \u201csystematic and obligatory checks to be carried out at all our external borders and on all people entering the Schengen area, including those who benefit from the freedom of movement,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Cazeneuve has expressed fury that France found out that the ringleader of the Paris attacks, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, had slipped undetected back into Europe only from intelligence provided by a non-European country, believed to be Morocco.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Danjean said he hoped that the gun control laws could be unified eventually in the European Union, pointing out that Belgian laws are much less restrictive than French ones.\n\nWhile the difficulties with Schengen are largely technical and administrative, the politics around the subject have become nasty, feeding Europe\u2019s far-right parties, especially France\u2019s National Front and Sweden\u2019s Democrats.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, said that \u201cthe absence of national borders is criminal madness.\u201d Striking a familiar but trenchant theme, she said: \u201cThe French elites have given themselves over to this surreal myth of a country without borders.
