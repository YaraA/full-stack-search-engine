The prosecutor\u2019s office said on Friday that it would hand over the case to investigating magistrates, who would look into Mr. Fillon\u2019s suspected \u201cmisuse of public funds.\u201d\n\nThe investigative judges have the power to summon Mr. Fillon and others for questioning. His lawyers will now have access to the case files and will have more opportunities to file procedural appeals, which could likely delay the filing of formal charges until after the election.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His decline in popularity in rural areas where his focus on integrity was his strongest appeal has been amply documented in the French news media.\n\nMr. Fillon has angrily denied wrongdoing in speeches, news conferences and television appearances, and he has largely blamed the news media for his problems. His combative stance and his vow to stay in the race \u2014 and the lack of an alternative for center-right voters \u2014 have enabled him to rally his core supporters and to partly claw his way back in the polls.\n\nBy Friday, he had regained second place in many surveys, behind Ms. Le Pen and ahead Mr. Macron.\n\nUnder the French system, if no presidential candidate wins a majority of votes, the top two candidates move on to a second round. Ms. Le Pen is expected to win the first round, but the polling until now has suggested that either Mr. Fillon or Mr. Macron would defeat her in round two.\n\nMany conservative voters are thought to be skeptical of Mr. Macron\u2019s service in the Socialist government, his youth (he is 39) and his inexperience.\n\nA series of recent gaffes caused an uproar on the right. On a visit to Algeria, Mr. Macron declared France\u2019s colonization of the country a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d \u2014 a red flag in France, where memories of the bloody war over Algerian independence are not so distant.\n\nThe comment cost Mr. Macron in the polls, helping both Mr. Fillon and Ms. Le Pen, who faces an inquiry of her own over the possible abuse of public funds."}
