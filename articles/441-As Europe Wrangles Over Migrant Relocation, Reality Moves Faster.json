Warning that Europe could face millions of people seeking to enter its borders, he said \u201cit is clear that the greatest tide of refugees and migrants is yet to come\u201d and called for an end to \u201cpolicies of open doors and windows.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHelping in Piraeus to secure Europe\u2019s eastern frontier is Grigorios Apostolou, a former Greek police officer, who now runs a six-person office set up by Frontex, the European border control agency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom his office overlooking Piraeus port, he watches ferries steam in each day from Greek islands near Turkey with yet more migrants, but has no staff or mandate to check whether they have been properly registered, which is supposed to happen on Lesbos or wherever they first arrived on European soil.\n\nThat, he said, is the responsibility of local Greek officials. Frontex, he added, has sent about a dozen border guards and also patrol vessels, borrowed from different European states, to help the Hellenic Coast Guard in outlying islands.\n\nBut he noted, Frontex has no authority to tell the Greek authorities whom to let in and what to do with them.\n\nIn any case, he said, the migrants \u201care far more flexible than we are\u201d and know how to outfox cumbersome bureaucracies. They are a lot faster, too, often moving within minutes of their arrival in Piraeus to head north.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe\u2019s newly approved relocation plan will take two years to put in place, and even if unwilling members of the European Union take in a share of refugees, there is little that will keep the refugees from moving where they want to go.\n\nAs such, the migrants have already proved more effective in relocating themselves, with a little help at the start from the Greek authorities.\n\nSaddled with an economic crisis and a dysfunctional state apparatus, the Greek authorities are so eager to move the migrants on that they now arrange special ferries for them from outlying islands and provide buses to take them from Piraeus port to the nearest railway station.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI am going to Germany where I can find work,\u201d Saied Abdirisak, an Iranian computer technician, said after disembarking from a ferry from Lesbos, which he had reached by dinghy from Turkey, a short trip that cost him 1,300 euros (about $1,450).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Syrians get six months to leave.\n\nBy midmorning, Mr. Abdirisak was already on the train from Piraeus to Athens with a group of fellow Iranians and planned to get the first train from there north toward Macedonia, which more than 4,000 migrants now reach each day.\n\nLeft behind in the rush were a heap of European rules and regulations that require all new arrivals to make an application for asylum in the country where they first land and to stay put until their request has been processed.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere is no real system. We don\u2019t know who all these people are,\u201d said Rocco Gianluca, Western Balkans coordinator for the International Organization for Migration.\n\n\u201cThis is a humanitarian issue and it also has security implications,\u201d he added, noting that people with a good case for refugee status, such as those fleeing Syria, risk getting overlooked.\n\nSuch lax controls at the exterior border of Europe spurred a call on Wednesday from the European bloc\u2019s top executive for measures to ensure the \u201ccommon security of our external border.\u201d They have also increasingly rankled member states that are having to deal with the exodus as it moves north from Greece.\n\n\u201cI think if the Greeks are not able to defend their own borders, we should ask kindly, because Greece is a sovereign country: To let the other countries of the European Union defend the Greek border,\u201d Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, told reporters as he arrived Wednesday at a European Union summit meeting on the crisis in Brussels.\n\nOne way Europe has tried to manage the flow is through registration and fingerprinting of all those who arrive claiming asylum. But this system, too, has broken down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe official Greek document issued to Mr. Abdirisak in Lesbos bore a stamp saying he had been fingerprinted. But he said he was not too worried because his prints had been taken on paper, not electronically.\n\nThat almost certainly means that his fingerprints have not been entered in the shared database, Eurodac, which is designed to keep track of migrants and make it possible to enforce European rules that restrict the initial movement of asylum seekers.\n\nPart of the problem is that Greece is sorely short of the expensive equipment needed to enter migrants\u2019 fingerprints and other data into Eurodac.\n\n\u201cThey have some machines but not enough,\u201d Mr. Apostolou, the local Frontex chief, said. None of the dozens of migrants interviewed in Piraeus said their prints had been taken electronically.\n\nAnother problem is that, after six years of wrenching economic crisis and constant demands for budget cuts by the European Union, Greece simply wants the migrants to move on.\n\nIn August, Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, appealed to the European Union for help, saying, \u201cThe immigrant flow to Greece is beyond what our state infrastructure can handle.\u201d\n\nAt the Brussels meeting, leaders agreed to send emergency aid to countries hardest hit by the crisis, as well as more than $1 billion to international agencies that are helping refugees.\n\nMore than 350,000 migrants have passed through Greece this year, according to the International Organization for Migration, but, in the first six months, only 5,475 of them had asylum applications registered here.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat compared with more than 154,000 people who registered for asylum in Germany over the same period, according to Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistical agency.\n\nThe gap is a measure of just how much what was supposed to be a well-ordered European system of registering asylum seekers has buckled under the weight of numbers and official inaction or obstruction.\n\n\u201cThe paralysis is alarming,\u201d said Claude Moraes, a member of the European Parliament and chairman of its lead committee dealing with refugee issues.", "summary": "So far, however, no \u201chot spot\u201d program has actually started operating in Greece, the entry point to Europe for most of the migrants now clogging roads and trains in Macedonia, Serbia and other countries along the route north to Germany.
