But after losing an election in 2007, she switched from mainstream politics to grass-roots activism, which she said was a better fit for her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably gone in the opposite direction to what is the usual path,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I just like this better.\u201d She added: \u201cThe politicians have been very tainted by corruption, but we are all volunteers, and I think that gives people a lot more security.\u201d\n\nMS. FORCADELL started pushing for Catalonia\u2019s independence as a college student majoring in philosophy and communications in the 1970s, in the final years of the Franco dictatorship. Spanish students were yearning for democracy, but in Catalonia, feelings of repression were inflamed by the Franco regime\u2019s prohibition of the Catalan language in education.\n\n\u201cI wanted democratic change, but it also increasingly made sense to me that protecting a language and gaining independence were goals that should go together with that,\u201d she said.\n\nVideo\n\nAfter college, Ms. Forcadell worked briefly as a journalist before switching to education, a career she has continued to pursue, off and on, to this day. Her first assignment was as an English teacher, though these days she is not particularly comfortable with the language and declined an offer to switch the conversation from Spanish.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve now got some problems with English, and I have a terrible accent,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter leaving local government, she became active in the secessionist movement, going from one civic group to another, until the Catalan National Assembly was conceived in 2011.\n\nA year later, she was elected its president.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She \u201crises to challenges and has a strong personality, bordering on a temper,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Forcadell grew up in Xerta, a village of 1,300 along the Ebro River, where her father combined a small transportation business with agricultural work. \u201cMost people were farmers who also needed to do something else because they didn\u2019t earn enough just from the land,\u201d she said.\n\nCatalonia, however, is now Spain\u2019s economic powerhouse. Its 7.5 million residents account for 16 percent of Spain\u2019s population but 19 percent of its output. In fact, Mr. Rajoy and Mr. Mas initially fell out in 2012 after Mr. Rajoy refused to reduce Catalonia\u2019s taxes as part of a Spanish system that redistributes taxes from richer to poorer regions.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to decide how we spend our own resources and what level of solidarity we want to show toward others,\u201d Ms. Forcadell said.\n\nAs it has gained clout, however, the assembly has come under pressure to disclose its own financing. Ms. Forcadell is still a member of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, a left-leaning secessionist party, but she said the assembly did not receive any subsidies, from Esquerra Republicana or any other group.\n\n\u201cWe want to maintain our independence and believe that, during a financial crisis, public money should go toward social issues,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Forcadell said the assembly was financed by its 40,000 members, who pay minimum monthly dues of 4 euros, or about $5, as well as from the sale of pro-independence T-shirts and trinkets. The group\u2019s 2014 budget is about $3 million.\n\nORIOL JUNQUERAS, the leader of Esquerra Republicana, said he felt respect for Ms. Forcadell and the assembly. However, Ada Colau, who is expected to run next May as a left-wing candidate for mayor of Barcelona, said Ms. Forcadell was \u201cnot the spokeswoman of Catalan democracy, which is far too complex and plural\u201d for the assembly to claim such a role.\n\nMarried with two children, Ms. Forcadell initially combined her leadership of the assembly with her teaching duties. But this year, the secessionist work became so all-consuming that she had to take an unpaid leave from teaching.\n\nWhile tensions have escalated, Ms. Forcadell said that she did not expect the feuding to spill over into violence, even if the vote on Sunday is called off. If that should happen, she said, frustrated Catalans would continue to push for secession \u201cdemocratically and peacefully.\u201d\n\nShould Catalonia eventually gain independence, Ms. Forcadell said that she was unsure whether she would want a government role. \u201cThe only thing I know is that I will celebrate with a long holiday, because pushing for independence has already involved almost three years of very hard work,\u201d she said.", "summary": "In fact, Ms. Forcadell argues that Artur Mas, the head of the Catalan regional government, would not have converted to the secessionist cause and scheduled a ballot on independence on Nov. 9 without the street demonstrations she helped organize.\u201cMas was not for independence, but he saw that civil society was going to trample over the politicians unless they climbed on board,\u201d she said in a recent interview in the windowless office from which she runs the assembly.Ms. Forcadell, 58, has got \u201ca simple approach and a power to bring people together that most politicians don\u2019t have,\u201d said Pere Mart\u00ed, a journalist who published a book on the assembly last year.MS.
