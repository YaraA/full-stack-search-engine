Six double bunk beds sleeping 12 are squeezed into these spaces, with no room for a spare chair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not space designed for living,\u201d Constanze D\u00f6ll, a spokeswoman, noted of Tempelhof Projekt, the city agency that is responsible for the overall development. \u201cIt\u2019s an aircraft hangar.\u201d\n\nIndeed, under the Nazis, imprisoned laborers were forced to build aircraft in these hangars.\n\nIn 1948 and 1949, American C-47s brought in millions of tons of food, coal and other supplies for the Berlin airlift, in an operation that, at its height, saw planes landing every 90 seconds.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of the aircraft scattered small parachutes with raisins and chocolates. The \u201craisin bombers,\u201d as they were dubbed, are still fondly remembered in a city that has both loved and hated the Americans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThroughout the Cold War, the United States military operated here, along with civilian flights. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the American military gradually withdrew.\n\nAs the newly united Berlin melded its western and eastern halves, various uses were discussed for Tempelhof. But, in classic Berlin fashion, none were ever really decided. In the latest referendum in 2014, Berliners rejected a plan to build 4,700 homes while leaving up to 85 percent of its vast green space open.\n\nCity planners who may have cursed that missed opportunity to build needed housing are now at least partly relieved; where permanent houses might have gone up, they can now erect prefab housing for refugees not housed in hangars.\n\nHolger Lippmann, 52, who leads the Tempelhof Projekt, has certainly felt the effects of the airport\u2019s evolving fate. He came to the job in the summer of 2015 as a place holder, having previously been charged, for 13 years, with selling off land the city thought it did not need.\n\nNow he will stay at least two years and is among those interested in preserving every inch of city land to house not just refugees but the increasing number of families staying in Berlin, or moving here, squeezing housing and schools.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

On the night of Oct. 23-24, they were told to ready a hangar for refugees.\n\n\u201cBack then, 16,000 or more refugees were arriving at the Bavarian border each night,\u201d Mr. Lippmann said. \u201cThey would put them in buses, then drivers would call us from the autobahn, saying they would be in Berlin in three hours. And in that time, you have to get the fire brigade, the police, even the army, and the volunteers organized.\u201d\n\nNeither he nor Mr. Elias could give costs to date, or future costs, of the program. \u201cA lot,\u201d Mr. Elias said, when asked. Mr. Lippmann said just heating the inhabited hangars costs 20,000 euros a day, or about $26,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA recent visit on a fairly mild, windy day yielded glimpses of refugees, many on cellphones, others lying listless in their cramped bunks, and children being entertained by volunteers from a circus group and the charity Save the Children.\n\nDozens of new units, each containing a toilet, washbasin and shower for individual use, awaited hookup. They were purchased after refugees, particularly women, declined to use communal showers.\n\nAlmost each day brings a new challenge. After hundreds of women were assaulted on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne by young men said to be migrants, women who work in more than 100 offices here became fearful.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAfter Cologne, we have a special sensitivity and worry,\u201d Mr. Lippmann said.\n\nEmployees once engaged in staging money-earning events \u2014 TV galas or fashion shows, for example \u2014 in Tempelhof are now busy undoing those contracts, and assessing refugee needs.\n\nThere are still reminders of the American military presence here. A sign says this hangar was once part of \u201cBerlin Brigade/Freedom City,\u201d of the United States Army Aviation Department.\n\n\u201cHigh Noise Protection Required,\u201d says another sign, in a hangar whose vastness mutes any buzz from the 800 or so refugees currently accommodated there.\n\nThe refugees have already added their own layer to Tempelhof\u2019s archaeology: graffiti on the white walls with simple messages or flags and emblems of Iraq, Kurdistan and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cI love you Syria,\u201d says one. \u201cThank you Germane,\u201d says another, with a heart, referring to Germany. Still another: \u201cLove love love.\u201d And a smiling face with the word \u201cHapee\u201d next to it.\n\nIdeally, Mr. Elias said, refugees should spend just a few weeks here before moving through the system. He likens Germany to a society that used to cook with just salt and pepper.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have a real potpourri.\u201d The influx, he added, \u201cis positive \u2014 society is thinking about what kind of values it holds dear.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cThere is no blueprint for something like this,\u201d said Michael Elias, who leads the company, Tamaja, that runs the refugee facilities, organizing everything from security to cleaning and the catering that delivers breakfast, lunch and dinner.
