{"title": "Barcelona Attacks Add to Tension Between Catalonia and Spain", "authors": ["Raphael Minder"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/world/europe/barcelona-attacks-tension-catalonia-spain.html", "body": "Spain\u2019s interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, and his regional counterpart in Catalonia, Joaquim Forn, publicly disagreed this past weekend in their assessment of whether the terrorist cell had been dismantled.\n\nMr. Forn also stoked controversy by making a distinction between Catalan and other Spanish victims of the attacks, during an interview with local media.\n\nThose political differences, it is becoming clearer, also have practical security implications that the attack plotters perhaps managed to exploit.\n\nThe plotters circumvented a security apparatus that, until last week, had helped Spain avoid attacks like the Madrid train bombings that killed 192 people in 2004.\n\nTwo decades ago, Madrid agreed to give Catalonia full control over policing under its own force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra. Even before last week\u2019s attacks, however, Catalan separatists were demanding more resources for the Mossos.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Puigdemont used a television interview to argue that Catalonia should have direct ties to the C.I.A. and other intelligence services, without information passing through Madrid.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the Spanish secret services are in contact with the services of other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the Mossos would love to have this direct relationship with the C.I.A. but it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Tuesday, however, an association representing Spain\u2019s national and military police turned the argument around, claiming instead that the Catalan authorities had marginalized the contribution of Madrid, \u201cwith only one goal in mind: to show an image outside our borders of a self-sufficient Catalan state.\u201d\n\nAdding to this controversy, the Catalan authorities have now acknowledged that last year a Belgian police officer requested information from a Catalan colleague about Abdelbaki Essati, an imam who is believed to have inspired last week\u2019s attacks. The request, however, was made in \u201can absolutely informal manner,\u201d Mr. Forn, the region\u2019s interior minister, said Thursday at a news conference.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Earlier this week, the Popular Unity Candidacy \u2014 a far-left and anti-monarchy party known by its Catalan acronym, CUP \u2014 threatened to boycott the march if King Felipe attends.\n\nOne of the party\u2019s lawmakers, Mireia Boya, told a local radio station that the monarch was \u201ca friend of Qatar and the Emirates\u201d and as such had contributed to the financing of Islamic terrorism. The party\u2019s threat, however, drew a strong rebuke from Mr. Puigdemont.\n\nThe CUP is a small but pivotal force in the drive for Catalan independence. Its members have guaranteed that a coalition of separatists hold a majority of the seats in Catalonia\u2019s regional parliament.\n\nThe party\u2019s reaction to the attacks suggests they not only aggravated tensions between Madrid and Barcelona but created frictions among the separatists themselves.\n\nAfter the attacks, Madrid-based newspapers ran editorials urging the Catalan separatist government to abandon its referendum plan. \u201cAn attack on this scale must serve as a wake-up call for Catalan political forces to return to reality,\u201d El Pa\u00eds wrote.\n\nSuch commentary, however, has incensed separatists. \u201cSpain\u2019s politicians and media have a long tradition of using terrorism as a political tool, the clearest example being what happened in 2004,\u201d said Salvador Garcia-Ruiz, the chief executive of Ara, a Catalan newspaper that backs independence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing the start of the same kind of manipulation \u2014 and I think it will only get worse\u201d as the referendum deadline approaches, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 2004 bombing of commuter trains in Madrid \u2014 only days before a national election \u2014 changed the course of Spanish politics.\n\nVoters then punished a conservative government for its rush to blame Basque separatists rather than jihadi militants for the train bombings, Spain\u2019s deadliest terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly the temptation to score points in both Barcelona and Madrid, but everybody remembers there could be an even bigger price to pay if any action gets seen as using such horror only for political gain,\u201d said Josep Ramoneda, a political columnist. \u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate situation for both sides.\u201d"}
