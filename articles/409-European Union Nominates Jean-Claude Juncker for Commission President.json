Mr. Cameron has previously said that his goal was to win reforms in areas like immigration and to slim down the responsibilities of the European Union, allowing Britain to remain in the bloc on revised terms.\n\nMr. Cameron said the job of keeping Britain in a reformed European Union has become harder. \u201cThe battle to reform this organization is going to be longer and tougher,\u201d he said.\n\nAngela Merkel, the German chancellor, said in a separate news conference that Mr. Juncker had \u201cEuropean experience\u201d for the job. But she also was \u201cready to address British concerns\u201d about the European Union, including the selection process that had so riled Mr. Cameron.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhether Britain remains a formal member of the bloc is likely to be a key issue in the British general election campaign next year. Mr. Cameron has previously pledged to hold a referendum in 2017 on whether Britain should remain a member if he wins re-election.\n\nThe decision about who should lead the organization\u2019s most important agency was always going to be an acrimonious process after populist upstart parties on the right and left surged in legislative elections in May.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe drubbing of mainstream parties in the voting for the European Parliament by parties like the National Front in France and the U.K. Independence Party put into stark relief the challenge facing the project to integrate the Continent, which began in the wake of World War II.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many Germans warned that ignoring the results of the elections by choosing an outside candidate could create further resentment of Brussels.\n\nSweden and the Netherlands had also been skeptical about the process for nominating Mr. Juncker. But their leaders also voted for him on Friday, adding to the impression that Mr. Cameron had been left in the lurch.\n\nAsked whether Ms. Merkel had let him down over Mr. Juncker, Mr. Cameron said \u201cobviously we were on opposing sides today and that\u2019s a matter of regret.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel declined to discuss any assurances she gave Mr. Cameron to seek alternatives to Mr. Juncker, saying she did not comment on such \u201cinternal discussions.\u201d\n\nUnder the Lisbon Treaty, which went into force in 2009, European Union leaders are responsible for naming the candidate, whom the Parliament then elects. But parties in the European Parliament outmaneuvered the leaders by putting forward their own candidates for the top job in Europe.\n\n\u201cThere is no longer any going back on this leap for democracy,\u201d said Pervenche Ber\u00e8s, a French member of the European Parliament, immediately after the vote on Friday. \u201cFor the first time the president of the European Commission will take his legitimacy from citizens,\u201d she said.", "summary": "In the longer term, the failure of the British to get their way in Brussels could raise pressure on Mr. Cameron to begin advocating a departure from the European Union.Mr. Cameron has previously said that his goal was to win reforms in areas like immigration and to slim down the responsibilities of the European Union, allowing Britain to remain in the bloc on revised terms.The decision about who should lead the organization\u2019s most important agency was always going to be an acrimonious process after populist upstart parties on the right and left surged in legislative elections in May.Independence Party put into stark relief the challenge facing the project to integrate the Continent, which began in the wake of World War II.For Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the Europe Program at the German Marshall Fund, \u201cthe struggle over the new European Commission president is one about the democratic future of the E.U.\u201d and \u201cthe battle over Juncker shows how real it all has become.\u201d"}
