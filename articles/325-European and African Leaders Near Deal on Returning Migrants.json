Eritreans are among those who often meet those criteria.\n\n\u201cThis action plan will fight illegal immigration and it will do more for legal possibilities to work in Europe,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told reporters. She said Europe had \u201cclear demands and expectations\u201d for Africa.\n\nBut the focus on Africa sidestepped some of the larger challenges associated with the flow of people into Europe. Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan are currently among the main sources of migrants reaching Europe, and many of them are coming through Turkey and the western Balkans rather than across the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa.\n\nVideo\n\nThe plan has raised deep concerns from human rights groups over the welfare of migrants.\n\n\u201cYou have to ask how accelerating procedures to return people can be effective,\u201d said Iverna McGowan, the acting director for Amnesty International\u2019s European Institutions office. \u201cOf course, when you think how desperate these people must be to risk that voyage, then they and a lot of others in need of protection will just keep trying,\u201d she said.\n\nThe deal is likely to provide for \u20ac1.8 billion, about $1.9 billion, from the European Union budget to help pay for the initiative, and to help address the root causes of migration. More money would come from national donations.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The lack of such documents is often the main obstacle to putting migrants on airplanes back to their homelands.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe latest draft of the deal on Wednesday evening called for more efforts to address the absence of identification documents, rather than create additional ones.\n\nThere should be a strengthening of \u201cthe capacity of authorities of countries of origin to respond in a timely manner to readmission applications, including through support to modernize civil registry systems and fingerprints digitalization,\u201d according to the draft deal.\n\nIn a concession to the African delegates at the meeting, the draft states that the procedures for deporting migrants should \u201cgive preference to voluntary return.\u201d An earlier draft foresaw \u201cboth voluntary and forced returnees.\u201d\n\nThe draft also calls for the creation of \u201creturn pilot projects\u201d between the European Union and African countries that come with \u201ca tailor-made package of support.\u201d"}
