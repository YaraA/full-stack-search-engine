{"title": "Greece Tries to House Migrants as Other Gates Close", "authors": ["Liz Alderman"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/world/europe/greece-scrambles-to-respond-to-migrants-in-limbo-and-more-arriving.html", "body": "Afghans, who make up about a third of migrants entering Greece as a back door to Europe, are becoming the largest group to be stuck in limbo here after Macedonia and countries to its north last week abruptly reclassified them as economic migrants rather than refugees. Thousands are waiting around in camps or venturing into central Athens, clutching registration papers, fielding pitches from smugglers for alternate routes to Germany and Austria and trying to figure any way to avoid returning to Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cEven with the border closed, Afghan people will still come: They would rather brave problems here than face danger and conflict,\u201d said Jamshid Azizi, 24, an Afghan who was stuck at Schisto, a camp the government scrambled to open last week near Piraeus, after the Macedonian police returned him to Greece following two attempts to make his way north. \u201cWe are going to wait here to see if the border opens, and if not, we will do what we can to avoid going back.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nEven while Europe remains politically paralyzed over how to handle the migrants, it seems to be confronting the reality that refugee camps could be present on the Continent for years to come. On Wednesday, the European Union acknowledged for the first time that a humanitarian crisis was brewing inside its borders, agreeing on an emergency aid package of 700 million euros, or $760 million, over three years to help Greece and other countries on the migrant trail deal with the backlog.\n\nAt least initially, a majority of the funding is expected to go to help the situation in Greece, and the move highlights the uncertain future for that country, where a debt crisis that began six years ago threatened to sink the euro, the European Union\u2019s flagship economic project.\n\nBut the money did not address the most pressing issue: getting migrants to stop thinking about Europe as their haven from war and economic uncertainty.\n\nEven if Europe reaches an agreement at a special summit meeting on March 7 in Brussels to stem the tide of people crossing from Turkey, humanitarian aid groups warn that desperate people fleeing Syria and Iraq will still try to come in anyway, while Afghans and others who do not currently qualify for political asylum could remain in Greece for a considerable period.\n\nVideo\n\nOn Tuesday, the top NATO commander in Europe, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove of the United States Air Force, warned lawmakers in Washington that Russia and the Assad government in Syria were \u201cdeliberately weaponizing migration in an attempt to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the Schisto camp, a former military barracks that the army converted into a refugee center in just 11 days, preparations were already underway to transform it into a semi-permanent holding facility. On a recent day, more than 1,400 migrants, all but three of them Afghans, milled outside under military surveillance, surrounded by a high fence topped with barbed wire. Around 150 white tents held eight people apiece, while larger tents held scores of additional beds.\n\nBy the end of March, however, the camp is to be expanded with container shelters to accommodate at least 4,000 people \u201cfor as long as they need to stay,\u201d said Vassilis Thanos, an army spokesman.\n\nAlready, a construction crew was clearing space for a playground near a makeshift clinic, a food hall and a worship area. The accommodations would keep women and children \u2014 who now make up around 60 percent of incoming migrants \u2014 separate from the men \u201cin order to respect their culture,\u201d Mr. Thanos said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Surrounded by barbed wire, more than 1,300 migrants fended for themselves inside the dilapidated facility. Migrants said no one seemed to know how long they would stay or when they could move on.\n\nAlong dingy, airless corridors thick with the odor of sweat, women lay on thin mats sleeping deeply as children wandered the area and young men whiled away the time playing soccer. On the floor, sewage had overflowed the day earlier, soaking some of the sleeping mats. Men and women formed long lines to get food prepared by a handful of volunteers who crowded a small kitchen, chopping tomatoes and scrambling to ensure that there was enough food to go around.\n\nOften there was not. In the parking lot outside the stadium, migrants mobbed cars driven up by good Samaritans who lived in the area and came to hand out bread, sweets and other food. \u201cEven if the border is closed, they need to eat,\u201d said Vangelis Vozikis, 55, who had come to distribute croissants.\n\nMany migrants seeking relief from the camps make their way to the center of Athens to Victoria Square, a tree-lined park where young men, mostly Afghans and Iranians, sleep under the open air as smugglers troll their ranks.\n\nScores of Greeks wandered into the square, handing out supplies and homemade food. Later, migrants crowded around police officers as they brandished photos of the Olympic Center. Earlier in the day, the former baseball field had opened and the officers were trying to persuade the migrants to get on buses to go there for shelter and food.\n\nThe sales pitch fell on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t go,\u201d said Ahmed, a teenager from Afghanistan. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go anywhere until we know whether the borders will open.\u201d", "summary": "Thousands are waiting around in camps or venturing into central Athens, clutching registration papers, fielding pitches from smugglers for alternate routes to Germany and Austria and trying to figure any way to avoid returning to Afghanistan.
