{"title": "In France\u2019s Poor Suburbs, Angry Voters May Skip Big Election", "authors": ["Alissa J. Rubin", "Lilia Blaise"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/world/europe/france-marine-lepen-emmanuel-macron.html", "body": "Just how many voters abstain could determine whether Ms. Le Pen can upend expectations and beat Mr. Macron. The prevailing assumption is that a broad majority of voters \u2014 a so-called Republican Front that includes the poorer suburbs \u2014 will come together behind Mr. Macron in the name of turning back Ms. Le Pen and the far right. But a low turnout could threaten this belief and help Ms. Le Pen.\n\nIn France\u2019s poor suburbs, many French are of Arab extraction with parents or grandparents who came from Algeria, Morocco or Tunisia. Many are also from sub-Saharan Africa; the former French colonies of Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal and Togo; and what was once French Indochina, today\u2019s Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. For them, neither the right nor the left has delivered when it comes to making jobs more available and reducing discrimination.\n\nRecent terrorist attacks have worsened the stigma attached to immigrants and Muslims. A number of the house searches after the terror attacks in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015, were conducted by police in Seine-St.-Denis, the political jurisdiction that includes Stains.\n\n\u201cThe second round is a catastrophe,\u201d said Cheker Messaoudi, 29, a Frenchman of Tunisian heritage. \u201cI think with Macron we are facing a war on the economy and with Le Pen we are facing a civil war, so it is bad both ways.\u201d\n\nWith an abstention rate of 38 percent including blank ballots in contrast to 23.5 percent nationwide in the first round of the presidential election, Stains reflects a particularly high degree of disillusionment. A community of about 38,000 inhabitants on the outskirts of Paris, it voted overwhelmingly for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, a former Trotskyite, who finished fourth. With Mr. M\u00e9lenchon out, many people see the race, as expressed in an old French saying, as a choice between \u201cla peste et le chol\u00e9ra\u201d (the plague and the cholera).\n\nPhoto\n\nTo many people here, the policy proposals of both candidates are unattractive: Ms. Le Pen proposes a law-and-order program that would place binational Muslims at higher risk of expulsion from the country if they are considered even remotely connected to those suspected of having terrorist links. She also has inveighed against wearing a head scarf in public.\n\nMr. Macron, a former banker, is seen as close to the moneyed elite. He is disparaged for his support for Uber, which employs many people at low wages and often under poor conditions. He worked as a minister to the Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who promised improvements that never arrived.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSociologists and political scientists who study France\u2019s poorer suburbs with substantial minority populations, known here as banlieues, said neither candidate had given people much reason to vote for him or her.\n\n\u201cThey are really tired of people talking about the banlieues but not doing anything,\u201d said Julien Talpin, a researcher in political science at the University of Lille. \u201cMacron in the banlieues is a kind of big failure. He appears to be an embodiment of the establishment, of the elite, and people can tell he\u2019s not one of them.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron received 22 percent of the vote in Stains.\n\nThomas Kirszbaum, a sociologist, says the demographics and voting patterns of the poorer suburbs are far more complex than is widely understood. Living together are people of immigrant background, who vote on the far left or not at all, and some longtime residents, usually white, but also some immigrants, who vote on the extreme right. In Stains, nearly 15 percent of voters favored Ms. Le Pen.\n\nThen there is a small, new class of young entrepreneurs, both Muslims and non-Muslims, many of whom support Mr. Macron, who has made outreach to entrepreneurs a priority.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. M\u00e9lenchon announced on Friday that he would not vote for Ms. Le Pen but refused to endorse Mr. Macron.\n\nMr. Belattar said he intended to vote for Mr. Macron.\n\nYet the sense of betrayal is acute among many people, not least toward the Socialists who had promised change but failed to follow through.\n\n\u201cHollande visited the suburbs but these were visits for the media,\u201d said Selimane Abderrahmane, an assistant mayor in Bobigny, a neighboring suburb to Stains, where the abstention rate in the vote last week was 37 percent (including blank ballots). Mr. M\u00e9lenchon took 43 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cHollande promised social and economic programs,\u201d he added. \u201cHe promised to end racial profiling. He was full of promises that people never saw come true.\u201d\n\nMr. Abderrahmane said he was voting for Mr. Macron only because he was afraid that the situation for Muslims would get markedly worse under Ms. Le Pen.\n\nHowever, his friend Sylvain Leg\u00e9r, a municipal counselor who is white and has spent his whole life in Bobigny, said that after voting for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon in the first round, he could not bring himself to vote for Mr. Macron. He instead will abstain.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s for globalization 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Leg\u00e9r said. \u201cWhat does that mean when workers come from their own country, mix with French workers, and on one side you have young people who want to work and on the other you have people who come from elsewhere in Europe or from other countries and who work for less?\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Catharine Bont\u00e9, 75, a former nurse\u2019s aide, recalled writing letters to past presidents seeking help.\n\n\u201cThey all helped me a bit with social care,\u201d said Ms. Bont\u00e9, who is black. \u201cAnd Giscard d\u2019Estaing\u2019s wife even came to support me once because I was a single mother and I was a victim of injustices and racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBut Hollande, he never helped me; he never answered my letters,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I understand the ones who gave up on voting. There is a lot of suffering here.\u201d", "summary": "The prevailing assumption is that a broad majority of voters \u2014 a so-called Republican Front that includes the poorer suburbs \u2014 will come together behind Mr. Macron in the name of turning back Ms.Le Pen proposes a law-and-order program that would place binational Muslims at higher risk of expulsion from the country if they are considered even remotely connected to those suspected of having terrorist links.Sociologists and political scientists who study France\u2019s poorer suburbs with substantial minority populations, known here as banlieues, said neither candidate had given people much reason to vote for him or her.Mr. Talpin noted a big change from 2012, when the poor suburbs turned out in large numbers to vote for the Socialist Party candidate, Mr. Hollande; he was running against President Nicolas Sarkozy, whom many people opposed.Yassine Belattar, a popular stand-up comedian who grew up in the suburbs, said that anti-government feeling was significantly stronger this year because of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, who ratified people\u2019s sense of injustice and their fury at the system."}
