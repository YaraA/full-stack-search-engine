German leaders have been watching as a tide of refugees has helped to galvanize support for far-right extremists, such as the far-right National Democratic Party, known by its German initials N.P.D., and grass-roots anti-immigrant movements.\n\n\u201cIt is a tragedy for our democracy when an elected mayor has to step down due to hostility from neo-Nazis,\u201d Heiko Maas, Germany\u2019s justice minister, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cSomeone who wants to support refugees in need actually deserves our wholehearted support.\u201d\n\nLast year, 173,000 people applied for asylum in Germany, and more than 25,000 have submitted applications already this year. Although it is Europe\u2019s strongest economy, the country of 80 million is straining to accommodate the newcomers, many of whom made their way to Germany after fleeing the war in Syria.\n\nVideo\n\nWhile many communities have welcomed them, the large numbers have also raised fears and emboldened far-right forces who observers say are seizing on the crisis to gain support.\n\n\u201cIf a democratically elected mayor needs to step down to protect himself from a far-right mob, then all alarm bells need to be going off,\u201d Cem Ozdemir, head of the opposition Greens told public broadcaster SWR. \u201cSomething like this cannot be allowed to happen in Germany in 2015.\u201d\n\nGermany lacks a strong far-right party such as the National Front in France or the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, given its mindfulness of 20th century history. But in recent months, it has experienced the growth of a populist tide, with thousands of people taking part in weekly demonstrations organized by an anti-immigrant movement calling itself Pegida, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The officials have been victims of social media campaigns, threatening letters and vandalism, with far-right slogans smeared on public buildings.\n\nIn one recent case, the mayor of Magdeburg, the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt, said that he had received three anonymous, threatening letters in 10 days. \u201cThey are very clear death threats, signed with a \u2018Heil Hitler\u2019 and Nazi symbols,\u201d Lutz Tr\u00fcmper told state broadcaster MDR. The police are investigating and have assigned a security detail to protect him.\n\nIn 2013 a local N.P.D. politician in the town of Schneeberg in the eastern German state of Saxony gathered several dozen people to surround the mayor\u2019s home, after he announced the city would be taking in refugees.\n\nIn the western city of Dortmund, the police barred members of a far-right party from holding a rally outside of the home of Mayor Ullrich Sierau, who continued to receive threats from neo-Nazis.\n\nIn Tr\u00f6glitz, regional officials decided on Monday to go ahead with plans to accommodate 40 refugees. Mr. Nierth, whose replacement will be elected in the coming weeks, said the decision was proof that \u201cthe mob on the street\u201d had not won.\n\nBut on Wednesday he called on the government to do more to inform Germans about the refugees. \u201cI think that regarding asylum policy, many people have a feeling that it is not working,\u201d he said on ARD, \u201cand many people feel that it could be better explained.\u201d"}
