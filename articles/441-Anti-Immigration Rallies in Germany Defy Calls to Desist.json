{"title": "Anti-Immigration Rallies in Germany Defy Calls to Desist", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/world/europe/pegida-rally-dresden-germany.html", "body": "In gestures intended to deny anti-immigration protesters picturesque backdrops for their rallies, the church and city authorities in Cologne and Berlin switched off the illumination at three of the country\u2019s best-known landmarks: the Cologne Cathedral and, in Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate and the TV tower at Alexanderplatz.\n\nIn Dresden, where about 3,000 people staged a counterdemonstration, the group known as Pegida \u2014 the German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against Islamization of the West \u2014 was confined to a park and a march around a nearby stadium. Ironically, the park is named the Cockerwiese after the late rock singer Joe Cocker, who gave a concert there in 1988, during Communist rule, and whose trademark song was \u201cWith a Little Help from My Friends.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMonday night\u2019s rally, held in a cold rain, yielded nothing new in the way of sentiment from the speakers, whose group insists that it wants to help refugees, but is against asylum abusers, foreigners who mooch off Germany and what it sees as a creeping Islamization of society.\n\nBut the mention of Ms. Merkel\u2019s name drew boos, and several people interviewed \u2014 typically declining to give their names to reporters \u2014 said her criticism of Pegida had disqualified her as a leader.\n\nEarlier on Monday, business leaders joined the swelling chorus against Pegida from established political parties, the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, social groups and even anonymous jokesters who set up a spoof \u201cSnowgida\u201d page on Facebook.\n\nIngo Kramer, head of the Confederation of German Employers\u2019 Associations, said, \u201cGermany\u2019s image as a business location is being damaged by the impression that we are demonstrating against foreigners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need immigration for our labor market and to allow our social system to function,\u201d he added in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe fear of foreigners, especially Muslims, threatening or drowning out national and regional identities forged over centuries seems to have a growing pull in Europe, where populists and nationalists scored record gains in elections in May for the European Parliament.\n\nSince reuniting in 1990, Germany has experienced outbursts of racist violence directed against foreigners, often in the east, where barely 1 percent of the population was non-German in Communist times.\n\nIn recent years, however, the Germans have offered asylum liberally, beginning with refugees of the Balkan wars of the early 1990s. The nation\u2019s Nazi past is often cited as a reason to offer sanctuary, but that has worn thin recently because of an influx of about 200,000 asylum seekers last year \u2014 four times the total for 2012 \u2014 and the strain of housing so many people.\n\nVideo\n\nAn anti-euro party, the Alternative for Germany, is flirting with anti-foreigner sentiment and won seats in three state legislatures in eastern Germany in the fall. While its leaders are bickering furiously, at least some have attended the Dresden rallies and are willing to meet with Pegida.\n\nAcross the established political spectrum, debate has raged about whether to engage directly with Pegida, as well as how to confront its clear appeal to a disgruntled segment of the German population. Its supporters include far rightists, neo-Nazis and soccer hooligans, as well as a larger number of average citizens who seem worried about losing status, even if \u2014 in Dresden and the surrounding state of Saxony \u2014 barely 2 percent of residents are foreigners and even fewer are Muslims.\n\nOn Tuesday, the country\u2019s best-selling newspaper, Bild, headlined articles with \u201cThe People Are Stopping Pegida\u201d and highlighted efforts to support immigration. Berthold Kohler, a publisher of the influential center-right newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, noted Monday in a commentary titled \u201cTerribly Simple\u201d that, despite Ms. Merkel\u2019s stand against the Pegida movement, it was clear that her coalition government of center-right and center-left was still trying to figure out what to do. The movement, he said, is \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d when it comes to a loss of faith in elites or institutions across the board.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That policy would involve a swifter processing of asylum requests and deportation of abusers, portraying this as the only way to continue guaranteeing a welcome for hundreds of thousands of legitimate refugees, particularly from Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u201cPeople are reacting to the situation with much understanding, empathy and remarkable voluntary engagement,\u201d the party said in the proposal. All who are helping should be thanked, it added, \u201cfor they are the face of modern Germany, open to the world.\u201d\n\nAmong the many voices discussing Pegida were the writer Peter Schneider, who over the weekend published his impressions of a visit to the last Pegida rally on Dec. 22.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor my taste,\u201d Mr. Schneider wrote in the newspaper Die Welt, \u201cthe crowd was too white.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that any number of issues \u2014 like Islamic State jihadists, Palestinian immigrants voicing anti-Semitism, or European women opposing Muslim attitudes toward women \u2014 deserved to be discussed in Germany and elsewhere in Europe where large numbers of immigrants live.\n\nThe answer certainly does not lie in declining dialogue with Pegida or its supporters, Mr. Schneider wrote.\n\n\u201cIf political correctness means that facts can no longer be called by their name,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthen society is robbing itself of a viable future.\u201d"}
