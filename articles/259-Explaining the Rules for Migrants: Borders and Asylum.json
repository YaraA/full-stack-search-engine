LYONS\n\nWhat is Schengen?\n\n\n\nIt is an agreement to abolish border controls among the European nations that have joined. For the most part, people in any Schengen country can travel freely to any other without stopping to show a passport or visa, just as travelers can between American states or Canadian provinces. Only when entering from outside the Schengen area are a traveler\u2019s credentials regularly checked.\n\nWhere did the name come from?\n\nIt is named for the town in Luxembourg where the original agreement was signed in 1985. The Schengen area began with just five countries and was set up separately from the European Union, but it was incorporated into the union\u2019s 1997 Amsterdam Treaty with provisions for some nations to \u201copt out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhere does it apply?\n\nMost European Union nations \u2014 22 out of 28 \u2014 are part of the Schengen area. So are four that are not part of the union \u2014 Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. For practical purposes, the microstates San Marino, Monaco and Vatican City are part of the Schengen area (but Andorra is not).\n\nWhere does it not apply?\n\nIn Britain and Ireland, which have opted out; in Cyprus; and in most of the Balkan nations between Greece and Hungary. Three Balkan countries \u2014 Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania \u2014 are expected to join the Schengen area eventually but have not done so yet.", "summary": "The migrant crisis in Europe has been greatly complicated by the Continent\u2019s incomplete integration, as national interests and political attitudes toward the newcomers have clashed with Europewide policies and initiatives that have been among the Continent\u2019s most significant political achievements.
