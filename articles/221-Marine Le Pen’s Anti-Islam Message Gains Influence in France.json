He recalled that after train attacks in 1995, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front leader and Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father, was given a sharp electoral boost after making a link between immigration and security.\n\n\u201cIt is certain that the discourse of Marine Le Pen, which makes the same link, stands a good chance of becoming perfectly resonant in the population,\u201d Mr. Cr\u00e9pon said. \u201cAll the more so because she has said that among the immigrants there would be terrorists. One could predict that this will prove profitable to the Front.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nOther experts on the Front agreed that the party would benefit. \u201cIt certainly will fuel the National Front,\u201d said Nonna Mayer of the CNRS research institute.\n\n\u201cWe have images of refugees every day, and now, terrorism,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cThe National Front has been saying, \u2018We have been warning you for the last 10 years.\u2019 At first sight it will help their dynamic, which is already excellent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAcross Europe, right-wing and far-right parties have also been capitalizing on the attacks.\n\nIn Germany, the anti-immigrant Pegida group organized a march of 10,000 in Dresden on Monday evening, and one of the organizers quoted Ms. Le Pen at length. In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban told Parliament on Monday that \u201cterrorists have exploited mass migration.\u201d In Poland, a minister in the new conservative government published an article on a right-wing website suggesting that, given the events in Paris, Poland might have to reconsider plans to accept nearly 7,000 migrants.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She then demanded a crackdown on Islamists in France, which would go on to be accepted, down to the details, by the country\u2019s Socialist government over the next few days.\n\nFarhad Khosrokhavar of the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales said he expected a strong political reaction against Muslims in France in coming months.\n\n\u201cThere is likely to be more of a shift to the extreme right, which will become stronger in the months to come,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysts here have long expressed admiration for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s political skills, even as they have suggested that her exclusionary message is harmful to France. She has handled the aftermath of Friday\u2019s attacks with particular deftness, several suggested.\n\nFirst, the proposals that she made Saturday, to \u201cexpel foreigners who preach hatred on our soil\u201d and to strip binational Islamists of citizenship, were immediately endorsed, in one form or another, by France\u2019s Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, and by Mr. Hollande, who suggested the measure should be applied to those convicted of terrorism even if they were born French citizens.\n\nThe newspaper Le Monde said Mr. Hollande had made a \u201c180-degree turnaround\u201d on this point.\n\nAnd then, unlike after the attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January, Ms. Le Pen was careful to moderate her tone somewhat, associating herself with the mood of national unity and grief, and lightening her criticism of the government.\n\n\u201cShe made a faux pas after Charlie Hebdo, refusing to associate herself with national unity,\u201d Mr. Cr\u00e9pon said. \u201cThis time, she didn\u2019t make the same mistake. She has tried, in spite of everything, to be part of this moment of national unity.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cIt is certain that the discourse of Marine Le Pen, which makes the same link, stands a good chance of becoming perfectly resonant in the population,\u201d Mr. Cr\u00e9pon said.Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.Farhad Khosrokhavar of the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales said he expected a strong political reaction against Muslims in France in coming months.First, the proposals that she made Saturday, to \u201cexpel foreigners who preach hatred on our soil\u201d and to strip binational Islamists of citizenship, were immediately endorsed, in one form or another, by France\u2019s Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, and by Mr. Hollande, who suggested the measure should be applied to those convicted of terrorism even if they were born French citizens.Le Pen was careful to moderate her tone somewhat, associating herself with the mood of national unity and grief, and lightening her criticism of the government."}
