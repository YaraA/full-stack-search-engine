The mood in the city of Barcelona was a mix of intense joy and subdued trepidation.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,\u201d Mr. Rajoy said.\n\nThe steps announced by Mr. Rajoy mean Spain will take direct control over one of the country\u2019s autonomous regions for the first time since Spain embraced democracy under the 1978 Constitution.\n\nAt the end of what he called \u201ca sad day\u201d for Spaniards, Mr. Rajoy assured them that he had the means to end a secessionist threat that, he said, was based on \u201clies, frauds and impositions.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe removed the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, and his cabinet, as well as the director general of the autonomous police force. He also ordered Catalonia\u2019s representative offices overseas to close.\n\nIn ordering the Catalan Parliament to dissolve, Mr. Rajoy said new regional elections would be held Dec. 21.\n\nPending the elections and formation of a new regional government, Mr. Rajoy said, Catalonia\u2019s administration would be run from Madrid.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFueled by a distinct language and culture as well as economic grievances, aspirations for a separate state have percolated for generations in Catalonia before boiling over this month.\n\nThe events on Friday, coming in the chaotic aftermath of an Oct. 1 independence referendum in Catalonia, were greeted variously with anger, concern and elation on both sides, with the prospect of even more volatile confrontations in days ahead as the Spanish government moves to put the steps in place.\n\nSpain\u2019s attorney general may now seek to detain Catalan leaders on grounds of rebellion.\n\nSuch moves were likely to turn the boisterous separatist street celebrations that greeted the independence declaration on Friday into mass protests, with one Catalan labor union already calling on workers to stage a general strike on Monday.\n\nDuring the debate in the regional parliament that preceded their vote for independence, Catalan lawmakers traded accusations and in turn described the occasion as \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201chappy,\u201d or else \u201ctragic\u201d and a violation of Spain\u2019s Constitution \u2014 perhaps the only thing on which both sides agreed.\n\nWithin an hour, the Spanish Senate in Madrid voted 214 to 47 to invoke Article 155 of Spain\u2019s Constitution, granting Mr. Rajoy extraordinary powers to seize direct administrative control over the region and remove secessionist politicians, including Mr. Puigdemont, the Catalan leader.\n\nIn a speech on Friday before the vote, Mr. Rajoy had said he had \u201cno alternative\u201d because Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist government had pursued an illegal and unilateral path that was \u201ccontrary to the normal behavior in any democratic country like ours.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nUndeterred by Mr. Rajoy\u2019s threat, and after a bitter debate, separatists in the Catalan Parliament passed a resolution to create \u201ca Catalan republic as an independent state.\u201d\n\nMost of the opponents to independence walked out of the chamber in protest before the vote, which the remaining lawmakers held via secret ballot, aware that declaring independence from Spain could risk arrest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe final tally was 70 in favor, 10 against, and two blank votes.\n\nSince the referendum, Mr. Puigdemont had been squeezed in a tightening vise of his own creation, and seemed at times to contradict his own declarations as he squirmed for a way out.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, wrote in a Twitter post that \u201cnothing changes\u201d and \u201cSpain remains our only interlocutor.\u201d\n\nSearching for a compromise, Mr. Puigdemont came close on Thursday to calling early regional elections in hopes of forestalling the drastic measures approved by the Spanish Senate on Friday and preserving Catalonia\u2019s autonomy.\n\nBut Madrid would offer no guarantee that it would not clamp down on the region, Mr. Puigdemont said, as he immediately faced a revolt in his own ranks from secessionist hard-liners who called him a traitor.\n\nAfter hours of wavering on Thursday, he relented and threw the decision on independence to Catalan lawmakers, who took the fateful plunge on Friday.\n\nAddressing the Catalan Parliament in Spanish, Carlos Carrizosa, a lawmaker from Ciudadanos, a party that opposes secession, told Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers that, far from creating a new Catalan republic, \u201cyou will go down in history for having fractured Catalonia and for sinking the institutions of Catalonia.\u201d\n\nIn front of the assembly, he tore apart a copy of the independence resolution. \u201cYour job is not to promise unrealizable dreams but to improve the daily lives of people,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore the independence vote, Marta Rovira, a separatist lawmaker, told the assembly that \u201ctoday we start on a new path\u201d to build \u201ca better country.\u201d She added, \u201cWe are creating a country free of repression.\u201d\n\nCatalan lawmakers who voted for independence could face prosecution for sedition, or even rebellion.\n\nMarta Ribas, a Catalan lawmaker, said that Madrid\u2019s use of Article 155 was unjustified, but also argued that \u201cit\u2019s a mistake to respond to one outrageous act with another outrageous act.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cA declaration of independence won\u2019t protect us from the 155, quite the contrary.\u201d\n\nIn the streets outside the Catalan Parliament in Barcelona, not far from a boisterous pro-independence rally, a few Catalans quietly expressed similar frustrations.\n\nThe Oct. 1 referendum did not give the Catalan government the legitimacy to vote to secede, said Federico Escolar, 53, a cafe owner.\n\n\u201cMost of the people who would have voted no did not participate,\u201d Mr. Escolar said, while smoking a cigarette outside his cafe. \u201cIt was not a proper referendum. It was illegal.\u201d\n\nWalking into a nearby subway station, Cristina Juana, a 38-year-old social worker, agreed.\n\n\u201cNeither Puigdemont nor the Catalan government knows exactly what the Catalan people\u2019s opinion is,\u201d Ms. Juana said.\n\nBefore the Catalan Parliament\u2019s vote for independence on Friday, large crowds had gathered outside in anticipation of what they hoped would be a historic day for Catalonia.\n\nMany were draped in flags as they watched the parliamentary debate on two large screens, cheering during speeches by pro-independence lawmakers and hissing those of their opponents. When proceedings hit a lull, the crowds cycled through a series of pro-independence chants.\n\n\u201cSpanish occupiers!\u201d was one, a reference to the national police officers who tried to stop the Oct. 1 referendum by force. \u201cLeave Catalonia!\u201d", "summary": "The events on Friday, coming in the chaotic aftermath of an Oct. 1 independence referendum in Catalonia, were greeted variously with anger, concern and elation on both sides, with the prospect of even more volatile confrontations in days ahead as the Spanish government moves to put the steps in place.Such moves were likely to turn the boisterous separatist street celebrations that greeted the independence declaration on Friday into mass protests, with one Catalan labor union already calling on workers to stage a general strike on Monday.During the debate in the regional parliament that preceded their vote for independence, Catalan lawmakers traded accusations and in turn described the occasion as \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201chappy,\u201d or else \u201ctragic\u201d and a violation of Spain\u2019s Constitution \u2014 perhaps the only thing on which both sides agreed.Within an hour, the Spanish Senate in Madrid voted 214 to 47 to invoke Article 155 of Spain\u2019s Constitution, granting Mr. Rajoy extraordinary powers to seize direct administrative control over the region and remove secessionist politicians, including Mr. Puigdemont, the Catalan leader.Searching for a compromise, Mr. Puigdemont came close on Thursday to calling early regional elections in hopes of forestalling the drastic measures approved by the Spanish Senate on Friday and preserving Catalonia\u2019s autonomy."}
