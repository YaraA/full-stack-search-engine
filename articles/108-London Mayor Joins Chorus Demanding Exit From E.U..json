By its geography, Britain, an island, is just far enough away from continental Europe to accentuate its differences, but too close to escape the pull of history, economics and trade.\n\nAs a Conservative prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, said in 1923, arguing against isolationism, \u201cWhether we like it or not, we are indissolubly bound to Europe.\u201d\n\nThose who want to leave \u2014 like Chris Grayling, a Conservative cabinet minister and leader of the House of Commons, and Justice Minister Michael Gove \u2014 argue that Britain can restore true sovereignty and control over its borders, trade relationships and immigration policies only by quitting a dysfunctional, divided and undemocratic European Union.\n\nBackground on \u2018Brexit\u2019\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s decision to join the out camp is another blow to Mr. Cameron and gives the campaign more spice, given that the outcome could decide the future leadership of the Conservatives.\n\nIt would be hard for Mr. Cameron to hold on to his job if the referendum does not go his way, an outcome that could also endanger the ambitions of his No. 2, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, to succeed him. By the same token, Mr. Johnson\u2019s political fate could be determined by whether he has chosen the winning side in the battle.\n\nMr. Cameron argues that a British exit, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d would only provide an \u201cillusion of sovereignty\u201d that Britain is dependent on its neighbors and that in a dangerous, globalized world, \u201cwe will be safer, we will be stronger, we will be better off inside the E.U.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s island and imperial history, say critics of the campaign to leave the union, has left proponents of an exit with an inflated view of Britain\u2019s importance in the world and ability to go it alone. In reality, the in forces say, Britain is a medium-size country struggling to pay for effective armed forces and to renew its nuclear deterrent in an increasingly messy world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to accept that Europe is our first circle of influence,\u201d Robin Niblett, the director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a London-based research institution, said in an interview. \u201cWe think of ourselves as a sovereign nation because we survived the first and second world wars, while others in Europe know that sovereignty is relative.\u201d\n\nThere is wishful thinking and nostalgia in the notion that leaving the European Union would restore full British sovereignty, Mr. Cameron said on Sunday in a BBC interview.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Mr. Cameron and his allies are beginning to make the case that Britain should remain inside the bloc for reasons of national security, too.\n\n\u201cIn a world where you have got Putin to the east and ISIL-Daesh to the south, how do you stay strong?\u201d Mr. Cameron told the BBC, referring to the Islamic State. \u201cBy sticking with your neighboring countries, your partners and your friends.\u201d\n\nTim Oliver, a fellow at LSE Ideas, a foreign policy research institute at the London School of Economics, wrote in a recent study: \u201cThe withdrawal of one of the E.U.\u2019s largest member states would almost certainly be a defining moment in the history of the E.U. with wider knock-on effects for NATO, European security and international relations. This presents a problem for all concerned.\u201d\n\nEven the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the United States is more cultural and linguistic than based on equality of influence. And President Obama has explicitly said the United States would prefer Britain to remain inside the European Union \u2014 not only because it makes the European Union stronger diplomatically, economically and politically, but also because it gives Washington a stronger allied voice in vital European decision-making on trade and security.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the end, most Britons are expected to cast their votes based on economics and anxiety about the uncertainty about what a departure from the bloc would bring, much as the referendum on independence for Scotland went in 2014. Scotland ended up choosing to remain in the United Kingdom.\n\nMore than 45 percent of British exports in goods go to the European Union, while less than 17 percent of E.U. exports go to Britain. Even a minor disruption in Britain\u2019s free-trade arrangement with the European Union would be costly, and if Britain votes to leave, Brussels will exact a price, in what could be a long and difficult negotiation, for the maintenance of a free-trade deal.\n\nMr. Cameron is also hobbled by his previous criticism of the European Union over Greek debt, the euro, the migrant crisis, employment law and much else. Yet he now praises the very institutions he failed to transform.\n\nIt may be Mr. Cameron\u2019s political opponents who save him. The Labour Party has come out strongly in favor of Britain\u2019s remaining in the European Union, despite the doubts of its new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who voted against Britain staying in 1975. And the Scottish National Party and its popular leader, Nicola Sturgeon, are fiercely pro-European \u2014 so much so that she threatens to demand another referendum on Scottish independence should Britain vote to leave the European Union.\n\nThe Labour Party, the Scottish Nationalists and the left in general share the belief that the European Union, whatever its faults, is a counterbalance to the United States in world affairs and has taken sharply different views from Washington on issues like data privacy, corporate taxation and the Middle East.", "summary": "Mr. Cameron argues that a British exit, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d would only provide an \u201cillusion of sovereignty\u201d that Britain is dependent on its neighbors and that in a dangerous, globalized world, \u201cwe will be safer, we will be stronger, we will be better off inside the E.U.\u201d Tim Oliver, a fellow at LSE Ideas, a foreign policy research institute at the London School of Economics, wrote in a recent study: \u201cThe withdrawal of one of the E.U.\u2019s largest member states would almost certainly be a defining moment in the history of the E.U.
