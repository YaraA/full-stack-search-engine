Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Sunday that Greece could not be required to shoulder the burden on its own.\n\n\u201cDo you seriously believe that all the euro states that last year fought all the way to keep Greece in the eurozone, and we were the strictest, can one year later allow Greece to, in a way, plunge into chaos?\u201d she said in an appearance on the public broadcaster ARD.\n\nBut Ms. Merkel is under intense political pressure at home over her insistence on welcoming people with legitimate asylum claims, and without much support from other European governments. While officials in Brussels have joined Ms. Merkel in decrying unilateral steps by countries along the migrant trail to limit the flow of people, it is not clear whether European Union leaders can reach some sort of accommodation before spring brings a new surge of migrants and the potential for more violence of the sort that broke out on Monday.\n\nThe police used stun grenades and migrants threw stones in the clashes on the frontier with Macedonia, which recently closed its border with Greece to thousands of Afghans after reclassifying them as economic migrants rather than refugees.\n\nThat move, which denied Afghans the right to apply for asylum, was effectively a response to an Austrian decision that put a daily cap on the number of people allowed into the country and that left thousands of Afghans with nowhere to go. It also promoted fear among Syrians and Iraqis, who worried that they might also be unable to travel farther north if similar restrictions were imposed.\n\nWhat started as a peaceful protest on Monday by people, mostly Iraqis, who have a legitimate claim on crossing but have been held up \u2014 some for over a week \u2014 by the recent intermittent closing of the border on the Macedonian side, quickly escalated to a riot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt started as a peaceful protest. People were walking on the railway line and ran up to the border singing and chanting, \u2018Open the border,\u2019\u201d said Gemma Gellie, a member of Doctors Without Borders who works at the migrant camp in Idomeni.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Germany\u2019s warmer welcome has led to tensions with other European countries, and last week Austria and nine Balkan states agreed to put in place several measures to reduce the flow of refugees. The effect has been a rapid buildup of migrants in Greece.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that we will have a number of people trapped in our country which will be between 50,000 and 70,000,\u201d the minister for migration, Ioannis Mouzalas, told the Greek TV channel Mega.\n\nMr. Mouzalas said that he believed that those numbers would be reached in the coming month, and that 22,000 migrants were already in the country.\n\nGreece is the most popular entry point into Europe for hundreds of thousands of refugees from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. More than 111,000 migrants have already arrived in the country this year, far ahead of the pace of last year, according to the International Organization for Migration.\n\nMore than 400 migrants have died this year while trying to cross the Mediterranean, the organization reported, including 321 on the heavily traveled route between Turkey and Greece. NATO has agreed to patrol those waters to combat trafficking of migrants, but it is not clear whether the presence of naval vessels will deter the flow of people.\n\nThe sporadic imposition of border controls by countries including Austria, Denmark and Sweden over the past few months has dealt a serious blow to the Schengen agreement, a cornerstone of European integration that allows the free movement of people across much of the bloc\u2019s internal borders.", "summary": "Greece, already struggling under its long economic slump and budget austerity imposed by the European Union, has requested emergency aid from the bloc to help it deal with the migrant crisis.What started as a peaceful protest on Monday by people, mostly Iraqis, who have a legitimate claim on crossing but have been held up \u2014 some for over a week \u2014 by the recent intermittent closing of the border on the Macedonian side, quickly escalated to a riot.Germany\u2019s warmer welcome has led to tensions with other European countries, and last week Austria and nine Balkan states agreed to put in place several measures to reduce the flow of refugees.\u201cWe estimate that we will have a number of people trapped in our country which will be between 50,000 and 70,000,\u201d the minister for migration, Ioannis Mouzalas, told the Greek TV channel Mega.NATO has agreed to patrol those waters to combat trafficking of migrants, but it is not clear whether the presence of naval vessels will deter the flow of people."}
