The reaction has been explosive.\n\nFor weeks the Socialist Party\u2019s rank and file has cried betrayal. Hundreds of thousands have signed an online petition demanding that the government scrap its plan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDeputies in Parliament have revolted. The unions \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s a return to the 19th century,\u201d grumbled one leader \u2014 have vowed to kill the plan.\n\nOne of the leading Socialist lights, the mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, who wrote France\u2019s 35-hour workweek as a government minister, wrote a furious editorial in Le Monde, declaring, \u201cNot this, not us, not the Left!\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, as the government hunkered down to ponder its dwindling options, thousands of demonstrators \u2014 workers, union officials, students \u2014 poured into the streets of the country\u2019s cities.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Labor court judges would not have nearly limitless discretion to award huge payouts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEqually infuriating to the unions, the law defines more precisely when a company can invoke \u201ceconomic\u201d reasons to justify layoffs. Workers who refuse to go along with temporary workload increases in the event of increased business could be laid off, too.\n\n\u201cIt will simplify the procedures to layoffs,\u201d said Philippe Aghion, a Harvard economist who is French and who lectures at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to go through endless judicial procedures. There will be less discretion for the judges. Now, there is enormous discretion on the amount.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty factor is a killer for hiring, the business owners say. \u201cAll we are asking for is a limit on the ceiling,\u201d said Mr. Asselin, whose company is a leader in the restoration of France\u2019s historic buildings.\n\n\u201cNow, there are no limits,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the fines are so big they endanger the employer. So today, it is risky to hire people.\u201d\n\nThe unions here, keen to protect their already-employed members, speak relatively little about the ranks of the unemployed. Yet many economists contend that the French level of protection for workers is poisonous to the job market.\n\n\u201cThere is a large body of evidence that increasing levels of protection for existing workers is detrimental to the labor market, particularly on weaker categories of workers, the young and women,\u201d said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, a French economist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cIf we want to address the fact that it\u2019s a labor market that excludes many, many people from a decent level of job protection by forcing them into short-term jobs, we have to address these conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current administration has accepted this perspective.\u201d\n\nFrance, however, is a difficult country to reform, as Mr. Aghion and others pointed out. Cultural shifts like those proposed by the current government always bring people into the streets.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are a country of revolutionaries and conservatives at the same time,\u201d said Marc Lazar, a historian at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques.\n\nPlaying into this is the French left\u2019s deep attachment to \u201cadvances acquired in the past,\u201d Mr. Lazar said.\n\nThe prevailing sentiment is that \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t touch the labor code, because we prefer equality to liberty, protection to adventure.\u201d"}
