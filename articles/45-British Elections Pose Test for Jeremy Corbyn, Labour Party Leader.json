{"title": "British Elections Pose Test for Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Party Leader", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/world/europe/labour-party-british-elections.html", "body": "Things would be \u201cpretty bad\u201d for Labour, apart from the London mayoral contest \u201cand London should not be of much comfort to Jeremy Corbyn because Sadiq Khan campaigned despite Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d said Steven Fielding, director of the Center for British Politics at the University of Nottingham. He was referring to the fact that Mr. Khan has distanced himself from Mr. Corbyn since last year, when Mr. Khan nominated Mr. Corbyn in Labour\u2019s leadership contest, but then opted not to vote for him.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn Scotland, Labour will be retreating; in Wales, Labour, which is already a minority government, might be forced to go into coalition,\u201d Professor Fielding added.\n\nScotland used to be a Labour stronghold, but Thursday\u2019s elections for the Scottish Parliament are expected to confirm the dominance of the Scottish National Party, which leads the Scottish government. Though it lost a referendum in 2014 over Scottish independence, which it still champions, the S.N.P. rebounded and won a landslide in Scotland in last year\u2019s general election.\n\nThe anticipated surge for the S.N.P. could inject new life into the cause for Scottish independence just ahead of the European Union referendum that is likely to highlight Scotland\u2019s preference for remaining inside the bloc. Should the overall vote in Britain be for withdrawal, against the wishes of Scots, pressure for a second referendum on Scottish independence would likely grow.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Labour\u2019s fortunes in Scotland are so reduced that it finds itself in a grim battle with the Conservatives for the place of second-biggest party in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nIn London, Mr. Corbyn faces continuing dissent from some of his own lawmakers, most of whom did not vote for him last year in a leadership contest that he won with an overwhelming majority of party members and supporters.\n\nThursday\u2019s council elections are one of the first major tests of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s electoral appeal. But Labour faces a tough task in retaining the seats it currently holds. They were last contested four years ago, when the party was performing well. In some of its urban English strongholds, and in Wales, Labour is also now being challenged by the U.K. Independence Party, which campaigns against immigration and for leaving the European Union.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Last week he suspended Naseem Shah, a lawmaker, and Ken Livingstone, a former London mayor and a close ally, after both were accused of making anti-Semitic comments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s internal enemies believe that poor results in Thursday\u2019s elections could prove a catalyst for a leadership challenge against him, according to many British newspapers.\n\nBut Mr. Corbyn told the left-leaning Daily Mirror this week that he was losing no sleep over speculation of a leadership challenge.\n\n\u201cIf there is one, there is one \u2014 but I\u2019m not having sleepless nights about this,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said, adding that he was \u201celected with a very big mandate to do the job\u201d and urging critics to \u201crespect the mandate. Respect the wishes of party members.\u201d\n\nA victory in the London mayoral contest would probably give Mr. Corbyn\u2019s supporters enough evidence of Labour\u2019s electoral appeal to quiet his critics, for the time being at least.\n\nUltimately his internal opponents know that even if they were to force a new leadership contest, they have no credible alternative candidate who could beat Mr. Corbyn among the party members and supporters who have the final say \u2014 and who remain largely loyal to their leader.\n\nBut Professor Fielding warned that some of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s own lawmakers were so disenchanted that they may be hoping that Labour\u2019s election results are a \u201ccataclysmic disaster and a signal for those who voted for Jeremy Corbyn to start thinking that maybe a mistake was made.\u201d", "summary": "In London, Mr. Corbyn faces continuing dissent from some of his own lawmakers, most of whom did not vote for him last year in a leadership contest that he won with an overwhelming majority of party members and supporters.
