{"title": "Ireland Abortion Ban Violated Woman\u2019s Human Rights, U.N. Panel Says", "authors": ["Sewell Chan"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/world/europe/ireland-abortion-ban.html", "body": "In November 2011, Ms. Mellet, who was then 21 weeks pregnant, learned that her fetus had congenital defects so severe that it would either die in the womb or shortly after birth.\n\nIreland\u2019s ban on abortion meant that she had to choose \u201cbetween continuing her nonviable pregnancy or traveling to another country while carrying a dying fetus, at personal expense and separated from the support of her family, and to return while not fully recovered,\u201d the committee found.\n\nMs. Mellet traveled to England for an abortion and returned 12 hours after the procedure, because she could not afford to stay longer, the panel said. More than 3,400 Irish women and girls traveled to England or Wales for abortion services in 2015, according to the British Department of Health.\n\nShe had to leave the remains of the fetus behind, and \u201cthe ashes were unexpectedly delivered to her three weeks later by courier,\u201d according to the United Nations experts.\n\nBack in Ireland, Ms. Mellet was \u201cdenied the bereavement counseling and medical care available to women who miscarry,\u201d the panel found.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

The committee found that the ban had a chilling effect on medical providers.\n\n\u201cWe are studying these views, which we take seriously, and we are assessing the policy and legal implications,\u201d Ireland\u2019s health minister, Simon Harris, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cI have read the report from the U.N.H.R. Committee and find the experience this woman had deeply upsetting. I have met with families who have been through the trauma of knowing their baby will not survive and I have been very moved by hearing of their experiences. I want to see this issue addressed.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, voters approved the Eighth Amendment to the Irish Constitution, which enshrines \u201cthe right to life of the unborn.\u201d In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that abortion should be allowed when there is \u201ca real and substantial risk to the life of the mother,\u201d including from the threat of suicide.\n\nThe consequences of that ruling were murky for years.\n\nIn 2012, an Indian-born dentist, Savita Halappanavar, died after doctors refused to perform an abortion while she was having a miscarriage, prompting international outrage.\n\nThe next year, the Irish Parliament enshrined the Supreme Court\u2019s 1992 ruling into law. But the law still does not allow abortions in cases of incest, rape, fetal abnormality or when there is no prospect of survival outside the womb.\n\nOn Thursday, Linda Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for the Abortion Rights Campaign, welcomed the United Nations committee\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cWe commend the bravery of Amanda Mellet and all the women who have spoken out about their experiences of trying to get an abortion, but women should not have to look to international bodies to uphold their basic rights,\u201d she said. \u201cHow many times does the state need to be told that its abortion laws are in violation of international human rights law before it takes action? How many more women need to travel?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSinead Kennedy, a professor at Maynooth University who has studied abortion in Ireland, predicted that the findings \u201cwill dramatically increase the pressure on the Irish government to hold a referendum to repeal Ireland\u2019s constitutional ban on abortion.\u201d She added that \u201cin Ireland, as in every country where abortion is restricted, it is poor and migrant women who must bear the brunt of these laws.\u201d"}
