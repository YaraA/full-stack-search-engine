Still, Mr. Macron \u201chas all the powers,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis, who resigned on Sunday as head of the Socialist Party, which with its allies won both the presidential and the parliamentary elections of 2012, only to see their popularity erode under the leadership of Mr. Macron\u2019s predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nA top Republican official, Fran\u00e7ois Baroin, wished Mr. Macron \u201cgood luck\u201d but said his party would continue to be heard, as the largest opposition party. Most of the better-known Republicans were re-elected, but Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, a moderate and one the party\u2019s top officials, lost to a Macron-backed candidate in her Paris district.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe record-low turnout, about 43 percent, dimmed Mr. Macron\u2019s victory and pointed to the tentative, even ambivalent, view of many French citizens toward his promises to transform France.\n\n\u201cMany people are in a state of uncertainty, a \u2018wait and see,\u2019\u201d said Luc Rouban, a professor at the Center for the Study of French Political Life at Sciences Po.\n\n\u201cThe level of abstention in the second round is a sign that a large part of the working-class electorate are not going to vote anymore,\u201d Mr. Rouban said, describing the sense of alienation evident in the abstention as \u201can invisible fracture\u201d separating the poorest and more modestly off members of French society from the rest.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Macron\u2019s opponents seized on the abstention rate to try to discredit his victory. The leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, said the abstention level was \u201ccrushing,\u201d adding, \u201cOur people have entered into a form of civic general strike.\u201d He suggested that with such a high number of people declining to vote, the government was robbed of its legitimacy.\n\nA majority of eligible voters did not show up, perhaps because they thought Mr. Macron\u2019s candidates did not need their support or, more worryingly for Mr. Macron, because they were unwilling to give him their endorsement. Many might have been tired of voting, having been called to the polls not only for the two rounds of the presidential election and then two rounds of voting for Parliament, but also for primary elections on the left and the right ahead of the presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNonetheless, the overall picture for Mr. Macron was a positive one.\n\n\u201cA year ago, no one could have imagined such a political renewal,\u201d Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe said, adding: \u201cAbstention is never good news for democracy. The government interprets it as a strong obligation to succeed.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron, 39, has seemed like a golden child of Western liberal democracy of late, with his stunning rise to power in little more than a year and his seemingly unerring sense of how to exercise it in his first weeks in office.\n\nBut Sunday\u2019s abstention rate suggests that he has yet to convince many French voters that his ideas and legislative program will make their lives better. The high rate could spur union-led street protests, a longtime staple of French politics, especially if Mr. Macron tries, as he has promised, to fast-track part of his legislative program.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, with 350 representatives elected on the ballot of La R\u00e9publique en Marche or its close ally, the Democratic Movement, Mr. Macron could justifiably say that a majority of those who voted chose his program of loosening France\u2019s restrictive labor laws, making it easier for businesses to hire and fire employees, and reducing worker protections with the goal of creating more jobs.\n\nThe National Assembly, France\u2019s lower and more powerful house of Parliament, will lose little time getting to work and \u2014 if all unfolds as Mr. Macron hopes \u2014 the steps will begin to change France. Although Parliament will not vote on key measures in its first few weeks in office, it will start discussing the measures later this summer, setting the stage for rapid passage in the early fall, including the contentious overhaul of France\u2019s labor laws.\n\nAlso on tap for completion in the next four months is a potentially controversial codification in common law of some measures in the current state of emergency, such as the ability to conduct house raids or place people under house arrest without the prior authorization of a judge. An ethics law for politicians is also expected.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s voting, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front party and its allies saw a precipitous drop in support since the presidential election, winning nine seats. Ms. Le Pen herself won her race for a seat in a district of northern France, but the No. 2 in her party, Florian Philippot, lost his race. Just two months ago in the immediate aftermath of the first round of the presidential election, analysts had predicted that the National Front might obtain more than 50 seats.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. M\u00e9lenchon, the far-left leader, won his seat in a district in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille. His party and its Communist allies won 27 seats, fewer than might have been expected after Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s strong showing in the presidential election, but enough to challenge the Socialists for the status as the main left-wing opposition party.\n\nOnly the mainstream right party, the Republicans, and its allies managed to maintain a significant presence in Parliament.", "summary": "\u201cMany people are in a state of uncertainty, a \u2018wait and see,\u2019\u201d said Luc Rouban, a professor at the Center for the Study of French Political Life at Sciences Po.\u201cA year ago, no one could have imagined such a political renewal,\u201d Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe said, adding: \u201cAbstention is never good news for democracy.The high rate could spur union-led street protests, a longtime staple of French politics, especially if Mr. Macron tries, as he has promised, to fast-track part of his legislative program.Still, with 350 representatives elected on the ballot of La R\u00e9publique en Marche or its close ally, the Democratic Movement, Mr. Macron could justifiably say that a majority of those who voted chose his program of loosening France\u2019s restrictive labor laws, making it easier for businesses to hire and fire employees, and reducing worker protections with the goal of creating more jobs.In Sunday\u2019s voting, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front party and its allies saw a precipitous drop in support since the presidential election, winning nine seats."}
