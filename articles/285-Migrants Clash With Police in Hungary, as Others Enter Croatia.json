Open!\u201d the crowd chanted. Excited young men clambered on top of that first gate, which had been broken open, and began bouncing up and down on it, trying to knock it off its hinges.\n\nAll of a sudden, an invisible, noxious gas began to pour into the crowd from the Hungarian side. In a panic, the people nearest the gate began to scramble backward, pushing people aside as they flailed, tears streaming from their eyes. Children grabbed for their parents. Some tossed oranges and apples they had been carrying back at the riot police, ineffectually. People ran into one another, tripped, fell.\n\nPeople grabbed for bottles of water offered by volunteers along the roadside, slapping it onto their faces and trying to wash the gas out of their eyes and hair.\n\nMy Days With the Migrants Here's a firsthand account from the migrant trail, with a look at the daily hardships and the moments of sporadic joy that occur along the way. Posted by New York Times Video on Tuesday, September 15, 2015\n\nThe crowd collapsed into chaos and ran back into Serbia. Then, the crowd re-formed and slowly moved forward again. And again, there was a gas attack.\n\nGrabbing piles of wood and bits of trash, a few dozen migrants responded by building small fires in the road and surrounding fields, the acrid smell of burning plastic bags filling the air.\n\nThe armored vehicle fired its water cannons toward the crowd and the fires, putting some of them out and turning the area into a swamp.\n\nMeanwhile, other migrants went behind a battered building marked Duty Free Shop and began breaking crumbling concrete and hurling pieces toward the Hungarian police, who were lined up just out of range.\n\n\u201cIt has been pressure, pressure, for more than a day now,\u201d said Rafy, 36, a high school geography teacher from Swiada, Syria, who watched the rock throwing from a safe distance. \u201cIt is like a balloon filling up. Eventually it must burst.\u201d He declined to give his last name, fearing that the family he left behind would be persecuted by Syrian officials.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe stone-throwing subsided when word spread that the Hungarians had opened the second gate. The armored vehicle had moved about 50 yards farther into the border zone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt is open! It is open!\u201d people shouted, and about 200 or 300 people formed cautiously on the Serbian side and began to walk slowly through the gate and toward the armored vehicle. \u201cThank you, Serbia!\u201d one migrant shouted as he pushed forward, clutching his sad sack of belongings.\n\nAs soon as the crowd drew nearer to the armored vehicles, dozens of riot police officers appeared, shields aloft. The crowd paused, waited, and then the police surged forward, batons swinging. With a crack, crack, crack, tear gas canisters arced through the air and fell all around the suddenly frantic crowd.\n\nThe gas swirled through the scampering crowd and, again, people begged for water and tried to thread a path through the chaos to fresh air.\n\n\u201cWe heard the crowd had opened the gate, so we came to see,\u201d said Mohamed Abdoulhanin, 25, a food safety supervisor from Damascus. \u201cWe expected them to let us in and they attacked us. Why?\u201d\n\nAlthough he had been hoping Hungary would relent, after more than a day at the closed gate, Mr. Abdoulhanin said he had given up.\n\n\u201cThis is the worst thing that has happened to me on the whole journey,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to live in Austria. It is so close. Just one country away! I guess I will try Croatia.\u201d\n\nBy twilight, the crowd had calmed again and the riot police remained in place at the border. People began preparing dinner in their windblown tents, but a growing stream of people walked along the road back into Serbia saying they would give Croatia a chance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe government said that 14 police officers had been injured, but the only injured people in evidence were people who had been trampled, hit with batons or flattened by the gas. Several people gasped for air on the ground next to ambulances.\n\n\u201cThis is not a peaceful crowd that wants to travel through peacefully,\u201d said Zoltan Kovacs, the Hungarian government\u2019s chief international spokesman.\n\nPhoto\n\nHungarian officials put part of the blame on the Serbian police, who were barely a presence during the afternoon and did nothing to subdue or control the crowd.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t see the functioning of the Serbian police, even though this is on Serbian territory,\u201d said Gyorgy Bakondi, an aide to Prime Minister Viktor Orban. \u201cWe are going to take all legal steps to ensure Hungary\u2019s security. Armed, aggressive, attacking people cannot enter.\u201d\n\nAleksandar Vulin, the Serbian minister for labor, employment and social policy, responded by expressing \u201cthe harshest possible protest\u201d to the Hungarian police firing their water cannons into Serbian territory.\n\n\u201cThe water cannon reached the Serbian side,\u201d he said. \u201cA state does not have the right to do that.\u201d\n\nInternational emergency relief officials said they feared the clash may portend more violence as the patience of the migrants runs out and many refuse to move.\n\n\u201cThese people already have covered thousands of kilometers to get to that point,\u201d said Balazs Lehel, program coordinator in the Budapest office of the International Organization for Migration. \u201cThey\u2019re so tired and frustrated that they don\u2019t have the strength to get up again and find another route.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut many were already doing so.\n\nNearly 600 migrants crossed the border from Serbia into the small Croatian town of Tovarnik by Wednesday evening, navigating through a processing center before boarding buses heading toward a reception center in the capital, Zagreb.\n\nCroatia\u2019s prime minister promised the asylum seekers safe movement, as long as they were only passing through the country. But humanitarian groups raised concerns that migrants could inadvertently cross through areas near the Hungarian-Croatian border that are littered with thousands of land mines left from the Balkan wars of the 1990s. On Wednesday, Croatian demining experts were sent to the area where many migrants were arriving, Reuters reported.\n\nHungary had moved swiftly to show that it would enforce its new laws. On Wednesday, the government announced that police officers had detained 519 people for illegal entry or damaging a border fence since the new rules came into force a day earlier. The authorities have opened 46 criminal cases, and the first suspects were to appear in court Wednesday afternoon, according to Mr. Bakondi, the prime minister\u2019s aide.\n\nCourt officials in Szeged, Hungary, said that nine adults \u2014 seven from Iraq, two from Syria \u2014 would be deported for illegally crossing, after expedited court proceedings.\n\nThe ripple effects of Hungary\u2019s crackdown reached as far as Istanbul, where hundreds of migrants were huddled in informal camps after they were prevented from leaving Turkey or picked up on highways and brought back to the city. Still, some had made it to Edirne, on the European side of Turkey, where migrants thronged a bus station in the hope of getting clearance to walk to the border with Greece, and some threatened a hunger strike until they were let through.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Greece, then Serbia, but skip Hungary and go through Slovenia, instead,\u201d said one Syrian migrant, Ghassen Tekriti, who arrived in Edirne on Tuesday.\n\nAt the Macedonian border and in towns like Kanjiza, Serbia, where migrants had pooled in recent months before making the trek across the Hungarian border, buses appeared Wednesday, offering to take people directly to the Croatian border.\n\n\u201cOur friends told us not to go to Hungary, because they would put you in prison for three years if you tried to cross the border,\u201d said Daban Sabir, 25, a student from Suleymani, Iraq, who was one of the first migrants to test the new route into the European Union through Croatia and Slovenia.\n\nClutching a document from the Serbian authorities that he had been told was essential to enter Croatia, Mr. Sabir and the others moved down the road toward a line of Croatian police vans sitting between radish and corn fields.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI believe this is a trend which will increase in coming days,\u201d said Terence Pike, who works with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Croatia.", "summary": "Still, the crowd grew increasingly impatient, and 200 or so people pushed up against the first gate, removing its razor wire and breaking it open at 3 p.m. A second, lower fence remained closed, a few yards farther into the border zone.
