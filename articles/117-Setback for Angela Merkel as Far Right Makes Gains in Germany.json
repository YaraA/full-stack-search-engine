{"title": "Setback for Angela Merkel as Far Right Makes Gains in Germany", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/world/europe/germany-elections.html", "body": "In a telephone interview, J\u00fcrgen Falter, a professor of politics at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, said the gains in the three state legislatures by the Alternative for Germany were \u201ca clear warning shot for Ms. Merkel\u2019s refugee policy.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel has no reason to fear for her position, either as party leader or chancellor, he added. She has no serious competitors, and unseating a chancellor is a complex process.\n\nBut Sunday\u2019s results showed considerable opposition to her policy within Germany. And in Europe, several countries have refused to take in refugees and have closed their borders to migrants, rejecting Ms. Merkel\u2019s appeal for a unified approach to the challenges posed by the more than one million who have arrived since early 2015.\n\nThis week, Ms. Merkel hopes to conclude a deal with Turkey to stem the flow. In exchange for European concessions such as visa-free travel for Turks and up to 6 billion euros, or about $6.7 billion, in aid, Turkey would take back any illegal migrants crossing from its shores to Greece.\n\nBut a crackdown on the news media in Turkey, growing clashes between Turks and Kurds, and general violence there \u2014 a bombing was reported in Ankara on Sunday \u2014 make the deal tough for some European countries to accept.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe chancellor has refused to set limits on the influx, and has argued that Germany and at least some other European countries can afford to shelter those fleeing war and hardship.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer tone hardened considerably after hundreds of reported sexual assaults by young male migrants on young women in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve, and as she hit the campaign trail in recent weeks. Yet that \u201cdidn\u2019t really do any good\u201d in terms of the Christian Democrats\u2019 showing on Sunday, Professor Falter said.\n\nIn all three states, turnout rose considerably, to 70 percent in the two western states and 61 percent in the eastern state, Saxony-Anhalt.\n\nFrauke Petry, who has spearheaded the advance of the Alternative for Germany, triumphantly proclaimed that her party had rekindled voter interest. \u201cThe voters have turned away from the two big parties in considerable droves,\u201d she said on the public broadcaster ZDF.\n\nThe Alternative for Germany was already in five of Germany\u2019s 16 state legislatures, but Sunday\u2019s results showed its new strength. The party won 15.1 percent of the vote in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and 12.6 percent in Rhineland-Palatinate, according to official results, and 24 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, according to projections by ARD and ZDF television.\n\nIn all three states, the showing by the new party illustrated the decline of the traditional parties. They have rejected any coalition with Alternative for Germany, but excluding it makes it harder to form majorities to govern.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Voter patterns analyzed by pollsters for the two public service broadcasters showed that the Alternative for Germany drew support from people who traditionally do not vote and from disillusioned Christian Democrats, but also from supporters of the Social Democrats and the far-left Left party.\n\nIn Saxony-Anhalt, people who did not vote in previous elections were the biggest source of the new party\u2019s support. That state has relatively high unemployment and has been losing industry and population.\n\nKarl-Rudolf Korte, a professor of politics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, predicted that Germany\u2019s big parties, which govern in a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d nationally, would draw closer together as a result of Sunday\u2019s elections. In other European countries, a closing of the establishment ranks has kept extremists from power, but has not necessarily brought their voters back to the mainstream parties.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the Alternative for Germany\u2019s celebrations in Berlin, jubilant supporters insisted that they were not far-right extremists.\n\n\u201cThe current policy of the national government has done everything as wrong as it could in presenting us as Nazis and not as people who just want change,\u201d said Klemens Riebe, 59, who works at a utility in Berlin. \u201cAnd let\u2019s remember that many of our members come from the middle class.\u201d\n\nParticularly in Saxony-Anhalt, voters feel dislocated by globalization, much as supporters of Donald J. Trump do in the United States, Professor Falter noted.\n\n\u201cIn this new world,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is much more insecurity than there was before.\u201d", "summary": "In a telephone interview, J\u00fcrgen Falter, a professor of politics at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, said the gains in the three state legislatures by the Alternative for Germany were \u201ca clear warning shot for Ms. Merkel\u2019s refugee policy.\u201dAnd in Europe, several countries have refused to take in refugees and have closed their borders to migrants, rejecting Ms. Merkel\u2019s appeal for a unified approach to the challenges posed by the more than one million who have arrived since early 2015.But a crackdown on the news media in Turkey, growing clashes between Turks and Kurds, and general violence there \u2014 a bombing was reported in Ankara on Sunday \u2014 make the deal tough for some European countries to accept.Karl-Rudolf Korte, a professor of politics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, predicted that Germany\u2019s big parties, which govern in a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d nationally, would draw closer together as a result of Sunday\u2019s elections.\u201cThe current policy of the national government has done everything as wrong as it could in presenting us as Nazis and not as people who just want change,\u201d said Klemens Riebe, 59, who works at a utility in Berlin."}
