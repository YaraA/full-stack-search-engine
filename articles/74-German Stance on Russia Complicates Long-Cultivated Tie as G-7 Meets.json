The choice put him at odds with the West and highlighted, particularly in the Baltic States and Poland, lingering Cold War fears about Russia\u2019s true aims. In Germany, even veteran proponents of close ties were troubled by bloodshed they could not have imagined more than a year ago in a Europe they thought had left war behind.\n\nMs. Merkel, who grew up in East Germany and whose conservative worldview holds no romanticism about the Soviet Union, nonetheless worked hard over many years to make a diplomatic partner out of Mr. Putin. They still speak frequently, though their relationship has grown more strained in recent months.\n\nBut the disappointment over how things turned out is felt particularly acutely by her center-left coalition partners, the Social Democrats, who were once led by Mr. Brandt. A former chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who is a personal friend of Mr. Putin\u2019s and works for an affiliate of the Russian natural gas giant Gazprom, went so far as to say it was a mistake to turn the Group of 8 into the Group of 7 by excluding Mr. Putin from the talks.\n\nHelmut Schmidt, who as chancellor in 1975 helped start the Group of 7, was also sympathetic to Mr. Putin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Schmidt said the Russian leader was fulfilling what he saw as his duty to restore the Russian state after its \u201cWild West\u201d years under Boris N. Yeltsin.\n\nThe business community, and a majority of Germans, have largely supported Berlin\u2019s tough stance with Russia, particularly after a Malaysian passenger jet was shot down over Ukraine.\n\nBut the leaders of the two main German institutions for doing business with Russia appealed to Ms. Merkel to let Mr. Putin back into the Group of 7, arguing that Russia was needed to get peace in Ukraine, to deal with chaos in the Middle East or to forge an agreement to address climate change.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome warned that the West risked losing Russia to deals with China, India or the Middle East.\n\n\u201cRussia has an alternative to Europe,\u201d Mr. Schr\u00f6der said. \u201cThat is not true the other way around.\u201d Last year, Russian-German business declined 18 percent over all.\n\nRussia, still a partner in some diplomatic ventures, is unlikely to return to the summit meeting unless Mr. Putin changes his tack in Ukraine \u2014 a possibility that seemed even more remote in recent days as the rickety cease-fire there teetered on collapse.\n\nThe German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, highlighted on Thursday that \u201cwe should have no interest in seeing the G-8 turning permanently into the G-7.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urgently need Russia,\u201d he said, to help solve conflicts in Iraq, Libya and Syria and over the Iranian nuclear program. Yet the West, he added, could not ignore that Russia had broken international law.\n\nExactly, Ms. Merkel said, emphasizing that seven, not eight, \u201cshould sit at the table\u201d this weekend.", "summary": "The choice put him at odds with the West and highlighted, particularly in the Baltic States and Poland, lingering Cold War fears about Russia\u2019s true aims.
