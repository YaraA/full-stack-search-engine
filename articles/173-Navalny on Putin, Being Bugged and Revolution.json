When you are in the company of bureaucrats you hear them talking about who has stolen everything, why nothing works and how horrible everything is.\u201d On Putin's Tech Saviness \"Vladimir Putin and his team do not understand the Internet,\u201d Mr. Navalny said after a newspaper distributed by a pro-Kremlin group showed Mr. Navalny with a man wanted by the police in Russia. Mr. Navalny said it was a fake, and his assertion was supported when the original, unaltered photograph appeared on Russian Web sites. On Arrest Mr. Navalny continued to post Twitter messages after being arrested. In this case, he posted a photograph of his fellow detainees from inside the police van that took them away. He followed the posting with, \u201cWe\u2019re in police van Number 2012. Attention! DO NOT BURN IT. Just puncture the tires.\u201d On Being Bugged \u201cHonestly, I thought they\u2019d hide them better,\u201d was Mr. Navalny's response upon finding a bug in his office. On Putin in the Sky When President Vladimir V. Putin piloted a motorized glider over an Arctic wilderness while leading six endangered Siberian cranes toward their winter habitat, Mr. Navalny offered this comment: \"About Stalin they said, 'In the night a light will burn in the window.\u2019 And of Putin they will say, \u2018He flew over our homes with a flock of cranes.\u2019 \u201d On Being Investigated When the police opened a new criminal investigation against Mr. Navalny, the street protest leader offered via Twitter, \"Hey you in the Investigative Committee! Have you gone crazy?\u201d He followed up with, \u201cI did not steal your packages, you goats.\u201d On the Human Soul When many of Mr. Navalny\u2019s large donors distanced themselves from him, he said, \u201cMan is weak. I am not blaming anyone, but man is weak.\u201d On Police When Mr. Navalny arrived at a rally in Astrakhan to find a large police presence, he wondered aloud where he was. \u201cWhy so much police?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs this a sector of Gaza? Is this the Republic of Chad? Is it Syria or Libya?\u201d The crowd shouted, \u201cNo!\u201d Mr. Navalny continued: \u201cI am afraid that the guys who sit in the power offices in the Kremlin forgot the name of our country. What is the name of our country?\u201d On Criminal Cases Against Him \"One year ago, when I was here at the rally, there were zero criminal cases against me. At a rally on Sept. 15, there was one criminal case against me. At a rally on Dec. 15, there were four criminal cases against me. Now there are either four or six criminal cases against me. I lost count myself,\" Mr. Navalny said. \"And I don\u2019t give a damn! There may be 124 criminal cases and I will go on saying what I want and I will speak my mind. And I think that you do not want to hear anything from me but truth.\" On Persisting The opposition leader delivered an emotional speech in response to a prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments demanding that he be convicted on embezzlement charge. \u201cI cannot run away from myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI have nothing else but this.\u201d On Fraud Case In his final statement in a case in which he is charged with defrauding a Russian subsidiary of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher, Mr. Navalny said, \"How many times in his life can a person who has done nothing illegal pronounce his closing words?\" He added, \"I do not for one second regret my actions fighting corruption.\""}
