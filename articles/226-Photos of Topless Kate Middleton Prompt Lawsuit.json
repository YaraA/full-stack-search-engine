Burns"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/world/europe/britain-rebukes-magazine-for-publishing-images-of-topless-kate-middleton.html", "body": "Another statement from the couple\u2019s office called the publication of the photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge \u201cgrotesque and totally unjustifiable,\u201d comparing the images to \u201cthe worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to the duke and duchess for being so.\u201d\n\nThe images of the duchess were not, initially at least, published in Britain, where newspaper standards and practices have come under an unaccustomed and fierce spotlight after the phone hacking scandal that has focused primarily on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspapers.\n\nA Web version of the cover of Closer hid its content behind a thick black bar. In France, the magazine went on sale with a cover showing the topless duchess, a headline in English saying \u201cOh my God!\u201d and, in French, \u201cThe Photos That Will Go Around the World.\u201d Inside, several grainy photographs showed the royal couple sunbathing beside a swimming pool.\n\nReferring to the duke and duchess, their office said Friday that \u201ctheir royal highnesses have been hugely saddened to learn that a French publication and a photographer have invaded their privacy in such a grotesque and unjustifiable manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir royal highnesses had every expectation of privacy in the remote house. It is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs, let alone publish them. Officials acting on behalf of their royal highnesses are consulting with lawyers to consider what options may be available to the duke and duchess.\u201d\n\nThe images emerged as the couple traveled in the Far East as part of a tour observing the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s 60-year rule. Their schedule for Friday included a visit to a mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The photographs were taken before the official tour, while the couple vacationed in Provence, in southern France, last week at what British media reports described as a chateau owned by Lord Linley, the Queen\u2019s nephew.\n\nThe villa complex, built around a 19th-century hunting lodge called the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Autet, is set in 640 acres of woodland and can house up to 17 people at four main properties. Apart from being a vacation retreat for Lord Linley and his family, it has also been rented out for thousands of dollars a week, offering guests a variety of recreational options including a tennis court, a swimming pool and an area to play the French bowling game called boule. A promotional Web site extolled its unique \u201cpeace and quiet.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron\u2019s office joined broad condemnation of the publication of the photographs, saying that Mr. Cameron \u201cechoed the anger and sadness of the palace\u201d and that the duke and duchess \u201care entitled to their privacy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCondemnation of the publication spread across the British news media, sometimes evoking old rivalries between France and Britain. A headline in the tabloid The Daily Mirror referred to the French edition of Closer as a \u201csneaky French mag.\u201d\n\nDiana\u2019s friend Rosa Monckton said in a message on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m on a rant and very angry having seen at firsthand the emotional price paid for press intrusion. My last word on this: leave Kate alone.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Prince William appeared to be reading an iPad as Kate rubbed sun cream into his back, the newspaper said.\n\nCloser magazine insisted there had been no breach of safety or security, according to The Evening Standard. \u201cIf two public figures chose to strip off in full view of a public road, then they can expect to be pictured, and they were,\u201d an unidentified person at Closer magazine was quoted as saying.\n\nThe editor of Closer magazine in France, Laurence Pieau, defended the decision to publish the pictures. \u201cFor me those pictures are not shocking,\u201d Ms. Pieau told The Associated Press. \u201cJust a beautiful couple, an in-love couple in the south of France. Kate is the girl next door.\u201d\n\nSince the couple married, the British press has generally fallen in with informal requests by their office for privacy, although The Sun, a Murdoch-owned tabloid, defied a royal request to refrain from publishing the photographs of the naked Prince Harry after they appeared elsewhere.\n\nThe British edition of Closer magazine said on Friday that it had not been offered the photographs of the duchess and would not publish them anyway.\n\nBut overseas outlets have been less cooperative with the royal household, publishing photographs of the couple and their puppy despite efforts by royal officials to discourage coverage of the dog.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to British media, there have been Internet photographs of the couple walking the dog on a beach in Anglesey, near a Royal Air Force base where Prince William is a search and rescue helicopter pilot. An Australian magazine has also printed pictures of the couple on their honeymoon in Seychelles.\n\nFrench legal experts who work on privacy issues said the couple could have a strong case under French privacy laws if they sue in a French court. Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gaultier, a parter in the law firm Olswang, told the BBC that the couple could sue for an injunction to force Closer to withdraw the issue carrying the photographs, and to prevent any sale of the photographs to other publications. They could also sue for damages, he said.\n\nMr. Gaultier said that there had been a longstanding wariness in France toward media invasion of the private lives of public figures, but that this had eased since the sex scandal that enveloped Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former French finance minister and onetime head of the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\u201cThings are changing,\u201d he said, but not to the degree that French courts would accept paparazzi using \u201clong-lens photography\u201d to intrude into the private lives of the duke and duchess. \u201cThe overwhelming public interest in this case is not obvious,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Referring to the duke and duchess, their office said Friday that \u201ctheir royal highnesses have been hugely saddened to learn that a French publication and a photographer have invaded their privacy in such a grotesque and unjustifiable manner.\u201dThe photographs were taken before the official tour, while the couple vacationed in Provence, in southern France, last week at what British media reports described as a chateau owned by Lord Linley, the Queen\u2019s nephew.Apart from being a vacation retreat for Lord Linley and his family, it has also been rented out for thousands of dollars a week, offering guests a variety of recreational options including a tennis court, a swimming pool and an area to play the French bowling game called boule.According to British media, there have been Internet photographs of the couple walking the dog on a beach in Anglesey, near a Royal Air Force base where Prince William is a search and rescue helicopter pilot.Mr. Gaultier said that there had been a longstanding wariness in France toward media invasion of the private lives of public figures, but that this had eased since the sex scandal that enveloped Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former French finance minister and onetime head of the International Monetary Fund."}
