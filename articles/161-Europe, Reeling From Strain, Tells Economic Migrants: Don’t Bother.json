The numbers are expected to surge in coming weeks as the weather improves and the risks of crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey decline.\n\nPhoto\n\nPolicies put in place by a number of countries along the path from Greece to Germany, the preferred destination for most migrants, have effectively limited passage across the borders to Syrians and Iraqis while blocking the progress of Afghans and people from a number of Middle Eastern countries and North Africa.\n\nOn Thursday, 200 people occupied the train tracks on the border near Idomeni, holding signs saying \u201cMerkel, Help Us\u201d and \u201cWe Just Want to Pass.\u201d Aid agencies warned of a possible risk of infectious diseases, given the area\u2019s limited resources.\n\nMr. Tusk\u2019s visit to Greece was his second in just over two weeks. Greece, still recovering from an economic meltdown in 2009 that led to three bailout packages from Europe, is bracing for the migrant crisis to continue for the next two to three years, Yiannis Mouzalas, a minister for migration policy, told a group of Greek mayors this week.\n\nOver the past few days, Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, has made a sort of reverse pilgrimage along the so-called Western Balkans migration route, visiting Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia and Greece before reaching Turkey. \u201cGreece and the Greek people are paying a very high price for the problem they themselves did not create,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cI want to state here very clearly that the European Union will not leave Greece alone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tusk\u2019s talks in Greece and Turkey were a prelude to a meeting in Brussels on Monday of European Union and Turkish leaders to address the crisis. In November, the European Union offered organizations helping refugees in Turkey 3 billion euros, or about $3.3 billion, to help deal with the situation. But Turkey \u2014 which is itself sheltering 2.7 million of an estimated 4.8 million Syrian refugees \u2014 is asking for more support for its position in dealing with the civil war in Syria and other regional issues.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Migrants there, hoping to reach Britain, have died trying to enter the tunnel that connects the two countries across the English Channel. Scuffles have broken out this week as the French authorities tried to dismantle the camp.\n\nThe financial aid, announced at a news conference with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in Amiens, came after France\u2019s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, told The Financial Times that if Britain votes to leave the European Union in a referendum scheduled for June 23, France might end its agreement to enforce British immigration rules on its side of the Channel and instead leave it to Britain to deal with the migrants on its side. Mr. Macron\u2019s remarks prompted a backlash in Britain, as proponents of a British exit accused the government of Mr. Cameron \u2014 who called the referendum but wants Britain to stay in the European Union \u2014 of planting the interview to frighten voters.\n\nIn an interview with the Munich newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Austria\u2019s foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, condemned his country\u2019s decision with Germany last summer to keep borders open as \u201ca serious mistake\u201d that had to be corrected \u201cas fast as possible.\u201d\n\nHis comments widened a recent rift between Ms. Merkel and her Austrian counterpart, Werner Faymann. Mr. Faymann wants to cap the number of migrants who can apply for asylum to 80 a day and those who can move through Austria to other countries to 3,200 a day.", "summary": "On Thursday, 200 people occupied the train tracks on the border near Idomeni, holding signs saying \u201cMerkel, Help Us\u201d and \u201cWe Just Want to Pass.\u201d Aid agencies warned of a possible risk of infectious diseases, given the area\u2019s limited resources.Greece, still recovering from an economic meltdown in 2009 that led to three bailout packages from Europe, is bracing for the migrant crisis to continue for the next two to three years, Yiannis Mouzalas, a minister for migration policy, told a group of Greek mayors this week.Over the past few days, Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, has made a sort of reverse pilgrimage along the so-called Western Balkans migration route, visiting Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia and Greece before reaching Turkey.The financial aid, announced at a news conference with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in Amiens, came after France\u2019s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, told The Financial Times that if Britain votes to leave the European Union in a referendum scheduled for June 23, France might end its agreement to enforce British immigration rules on its side of the Channel and instead leave it to Britain to deal with the migrants on its side.In an interview with the Munich newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Austria\u2019s foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, condemned his country\u2019s decision with Germany last summer to keep borders open as \u201ca serious mistake\u201d that had to be corrected \u201cas fast as possible.\u201d"}
