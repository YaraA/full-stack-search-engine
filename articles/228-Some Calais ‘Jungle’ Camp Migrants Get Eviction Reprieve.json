{"title": "Some Calais \u2018Jungle\u2019 Camp Migrants Get Eviction Reprieve", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/world/europe/calais-jungle-migrant-camp.html", "body": "What the migrant associations most feared \u2014 that bulldozers would immediately move in \u2014 appears to have been staved off, at least for the moment.\n\nJudge Quemener also ruled that the state could not get rid of the oddball restaurants, places of worship, schools, theater, library and other community places that have taken root, courtesy of the energetic volunteers.\n\nNot surprisingly, her mixed decision was seized upon by both sides as a victory.\n\nFrench officials publicly breathed a sigh of relief, saying Judge Quemener had backed their contention that the migrants had to go. Advocates for the migrants expressed satisfaction that the judge had decreed that the elements of associative life they take most pride in here \u2014 schools, the theater and other places \u2014 must be preserved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not unhappy at all, because they have protected things that are important to the refugees,\u201d said Julie Bonnier, the migrants\u2019 main lawyer.\n\nBut if there was something for everyone in the judge\u2019s decision, it was less clear that there was an actual solution to the increasing permanence of the camp, which has become an epicenter of both despair and disruption.\n\nEnglish Channel Calais Jungle Calais ENGLAND Calais English Channel 2 Miles FRANCE\n\nOver the last year, the police have been sent in to surround the 45-acre, mud-filled jumble of torn tents, with no sanitation or heat. Clashes have multiplied, and clouds of tear gas have floated over the Jungle\u2019s muddy lanes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the ruling, French officials said the migrants would now have to live in the metal containers set aside for them next to the Jungle, or be dispersed in reception centers across France.\n\nMany of the Afghans, Sudanese and Iraqis in the camp resist such a move because it takes them farther from their promised land, England, where they see more attractive social benefits and opportunities for work.\n\nBut the stern tone of the original government order \u2014 which had set a deadline of 8 p.m. Tuesday for the migrants to leave \u2014 appears to have been forgotten.\n\nAnd for now, life in the Jungle goes on, even as many of those who live there appear to regard some of the added elements \u2014 the offbeat civic life so prized by the volunteers \u2014 with bemused detachment.\n\nGroups including the serious and long-established, like Doctors Without Borders, and those whose militant talk brims with denunciations of \u201cthe fascist police,\u201d have staked claims here.\n\nPhoto\n\nCelebrities routinely use the place as a stage to express indignation over the living conditions; well-dressed young people can be seen filming videos of themselves, or bending over at odd angles to take photographs.\n\nOn a recent morning, a young woman was even spotted walking her dog through the camp. Another boisterously sang \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d to a bemused-looking Afghan.\n\nThe French state has neglected the Jungle, hoping that its unpleasantness would stop the migrant flow. But the migrants have kept coming, and the dire conditions have only increased the attractiveness to the volunteers, while multiplying the exasperation of the French authorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTuesday was mask-making day at the theater. Under the theater\u2019s large white canvas geodesic dome, some young Afghan men were hanging out in the back in the freezing cold, fiddling with cellphones, while another dashed madly about with a video camera, filming all who entered.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important,\u201d said Joe Murphy, 25, one of the organizers, a writer and playwright from England. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a place where people can come and talk all the time.\u201d\n\nThursday was kite-making day at the theater; on Wednesday, a masked mock \u201ctrial\u201d of the Jungle had been staged.\n\nA Short History of \u2018The Jungle\u2019 The area around Calais, France, has been dotted with refugee settlements for over a decade.\n\nA volunteer at the theater with cropped purple hair explained to a group of bewildered-looking refugees, \u201cI\u2019m not Christian or Muslim, I\u2019m punk.\u201d\n\nInside a darkened shack powered by a generator nearby where migrants had gathered to recharge their cellphones, the preoccupation was with England, and what would happen if the authorities succeeded in dismantling the Jungle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worryful for us, if they plan to destroy this camp and they don\u2019t have any plan for the people who are living here,\u201d said Habib Sadat, 31, an Afghan. \u201cThat\u2019s not good, not good.\u201d\n\nHe does not want to stay in France. \u201cThe French have some bad relations with the refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day around the camp, we see the police with gas.\u201d\n\nDown the street at the Secular School, under a corrugated metal roof, young men were earnestly learning how to pronounce French numbers under the guidance of a Haitian teacher.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA volunteer in a bunny jumpsuit darted among groups of migrants. Others embraced the migrants. At the One Spirit Ashram Kitchen, signs exhorted the diners to \u201cStay Healthy, Drink Super Chai\u201d or to \u201cEat Raw Garlic.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

The shops and restaurants on the muddy dark main street are suddenly illuminated. Sudanese tunes and other pop music pound from the shacks.\n\nPeople \u2014 mostly young men \u2014 from half a dozen nations stroll back and forth. An imam\u2019s call to the faithful wafts over the tents. The liveliness of this scene is in contrast to the moribund stillness of Calais itself, a northern French city long down on its luck.\n\nInside the shacks, some of the men prepare themselves for the frequent \u2014 and fruitless \u2014 assaults on the heavily guarded and barricaded Channel Tunnel.\n\nFew make it through. One freezing night this week, dozens tried at once; it was all over within minutes, the only vestige half a dozen French police vehicles filled with bored-looking officers at the roundabout near the tunnel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still between earth and sky,\u201d said Muhammad Ali, a bespectacled, middle-aged Afghan farmer. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible situation for all of us.\u201d", "summary": "Many of the Afghans, Sudanese and Iraqis in the camp resist such a move because it takes them farther from their promised land, England, where they see more attractive social benefits and opportunities for work.Celebrities routinely use the place as a stage to express indignation over the living conditions; well-dressed young people can be seen filming videos of themselves, or bending over at odd angles to take photographs.Under the theater\u2019s large white canvas geodesic dome, some young Afghan men were hanging out in the back in the freezing cold, fiddling with cellphones, while another dashed madly about with a video camera, filming all who entered.Inside a darkened shack powered by a generator nearby where migrants had gathered to recharge their cellphones, the preoccupation was with England, and what would happen if the authorities succeeded in dismantling the Jungle.Down the street at the Secular School, under a corrugated metal roof, young men were earnestly learning how to pronounce French numbers under the guidance of a Haitian teacher."}
