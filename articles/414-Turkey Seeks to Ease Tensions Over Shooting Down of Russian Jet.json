The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, confirmed that Russia had received a phone call from Mr. Erdogan suggesting the meeting, but he had no further comment.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, announced that, as of Jan. 1, Russia was canceling its agreement on visa-free travel for Turks visiting Russia. That should not have any immediate effect on Turkey\u2019s tourism industry, as Russians will still be able to travel to Turkey without visas.\n\nYet that may be a moot point. Russia had already all but banned its citizens from vacationing in Turkey in the wake of the downing of the plane, ordering travel agents to stop selling package tours. With about 4.5 million Russians visiting Turkey in 2014, they made up about 12 percent of visitors, second only to Germans.\n\nSeveral Russian news outlets reported that Moscow was considering canceling all air travel between the countries as soon as the bulk of the estimated 10,000 Russians now in Turkey head home, but there was no official confirmation.\n\nMr. Putin said somewhat grudgingly late Thursday that Moscow would continue to cooperate with the United States-led coalition in its fight against the Islamic State, but he said that episodes like the downing could jeopardize the joint operation.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to cooperate with the coalition, which is led by the United States,\u201d Mr. Putin said after a meeting with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France. \u201cBut of course incidents like the destruction of our aircraft and the deaths of our servicemen\u201d are unacceptable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Putin went on to find fault with the quality of that cooperation, suggesting that the United States, an ally of Turkey, was responsible for the fate of the Russian warplane, since Moscow had relayed the aircraft\u2019s flight plan to the coalition.\n\n\u201cWhat did we give this information to the Americans for?\u201d Mr. Putin asked, rhetorically, before adding: \u201cWe proceed from the assumption that it will never happen again. Otherwise, we don\u2019t need any such cooperation with any country.\u201d\n\nAnd he dismissed Turkey\u2019s claim that it had no idea whose warplane it shot down until well after the fact.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis is all a load of nonsense, just an attempt to make excuses,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cIt is a shame that instead of making a thorough investigation of the situation and taking steps to make sure such things never happen again, we hear from them these unclear explanations and statements to the effect that there is nothing even to apologize for. Well, this is not our choice, but Turkey\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nMr. Hollande said that he and Mr. Putin had agreed that France and its allies would share intelligence with Russia, coordinate more strikes against Islamic State targets and concentrate attacks mainly on the militants\u2019 infrastructure rather than that of other groups.\n\nYet the two presidents also made clear that there was still no consensus on one grand coalition, and that the Russian effort would remain separate.\n\nMr. Putin also did not give any indication that he was backing off plans to reduce economic and political relations with Turkey. On Thursday, Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia gave government officials two days to draw up a list of ways to curb economic ties and investment projects. That included the possibility of shelving a multibillion-dollar deal to build a gas pipeline through Turkey that Mr. Putin had trumpeted as a welcome alternative route for Russian gas exports to Europe.\n\nThe standoff between Russia and Turkey is posing hurdles for Mr. Hollande\u2019s effort to cement an international coalition to confront the Islamic State. Even before the downing of the military jet, Moscow and Ankara were at odds over the future of Mr. Assad, with Turkey insisting that he step aside and Russia seeking to build him up as a central ally in the fight against the Islamic State.", "summary": "And in a speech late Thursday in southeast Turkey, Mr. Erdogan criticized the Kremlin for its support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, saying, \u201cMoscow\u2019s siding with a man who conducts state terror is not acceptable.\u201d Mr. Putin went on to find fault with the quality of that cooperation, suggesting that the United States, an ally of Turkey, was responsible for the fate of the Russian warplane, since Moscow had relayed the aircraft\u2019s flight plan to the coalition.
