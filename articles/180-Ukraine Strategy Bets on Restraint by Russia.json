So while Western officials view each new Ukrainian artillery barrage in Donetsk as drawing the country closer to the brink, the Ukrainians see their unchecked advance as further confirmation that Mr. Putin is mobilizing troops only as a scare tactic to keep them from reclaiming territory.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe government in Kiev is \u201ccalling Putin\u2019s bluff,\u201d said Oleh Voloshyn, a former Ukrainian diplomat, who said political leaders dismissed Mr. Putin\u2019s moves as \u201cpsychological pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we pause, it would show Putin that any time he puts troops on the border, we will stop,\u201d Mr. Voloshyn said.\n\nUkraine was given just that option on Saturday when a separatist leader, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, offered what appeared to be an unconditional cease-fire to prevent a large-scale \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d On Saturday night, a senior adviser to Ukraine\u2019s minister of the interior said Ukraine would not halt its offensive.\n\nAs Ukraine continued its all-out assault, the international maneuvering over Ukraine\u2019s fate continued.\n\nSergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, spoke by telephone with Secretary of State John Kerry and called for \u201curgent measures to prevent an impending humanitarian catastrophe.\u201d The statement seemed to increase worries in the West that Russia might use the Ukrainian offensive as a convenient reason to send in troops \u2014 which it says are on exercises near the border \u2014 as a peacekeeping mission or to deliver humanitarian aid to areas under siege. Mr. Kerry cautioned Russia against intervening on the \u201cpretext\u201d of providing aid.\n\nStatements issued by the White House said that President Obama had spoken with both Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and that all had agreed that any Russian intervention, \u201ceven under purported \u2018humanitarian\u2019 auspices,\u201d without Ukrainian government agreement would violate international law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRussia\u2019s testiness over Ukraine\u2019s boasts of increasing successes was clear on Saturday. A senior aide to President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine said that diplomatic consultations overnight Friday with unspecified foreign officials had halted a Russian military column approaching the border.\n\nPOLAND BELARUS RUSSIA Kiev Luhansk UKRAINE Donetsk Marinka MOLDOVA ROMANIA Crimea Black Sea BULGARIA 200 miles\n\nA spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, shot back, saying \u201cKiev is more and more inventive in creating fairy tales,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\nIf the Ukrainians\u2019 calculations about Mr. Putin\u2019s willingness to engage directly are wrong, Mr. Obama and other Western leaders will face yet another crisis at a time of mounting danger in Iraq and as hostilities between Israel and Hamas continue.\n\nSo far, despite growing anxiety, the West seems loath to try to stop the Ukrainians, particularly after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, for which the United States blames the separatists.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

An invasion would also be costly, not only because of the likelihood of stiffened sanctions, but because it could plunge the region into an economic free-fall, bleeding funds from whichever country wins on the battlefield.\n\nBut Western leaders and analysts remain unconvinced Mr. Putin will be willing to be taunted endlessly or to permit extensive deaths of pro-Russian civilians. The United Nations said recently that at least 1,543 civilians and combatants on both sides have died since mid-April.\n\n\u201cThe Russian president has a record of brash, emotional and forceful behavior, and he could just \u2018go for it,\u2019 \u201d Cliff Kupchan, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group, a risk analysis organization, wrote last week in an analysis published by the group. The Eurasia Group estimated the likelihood of a Russian invasion at about 35 percent.\n\nSome of the only backers of the notion that Mr. Putin will surely not invade appear to be the pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine who crave his help. Yuri, a commander of about 500 pro-Russian fighters defending Donetsk, said he does not believe the Russians will cross the border.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cRussia,\u201d he said, \u201cis afraid of starting World War III.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, it is clear the Ukrainians are emboldened.\n\nA spokesman for the Ukrainian military operation in the east, Col. Aleksei Dmitrashkivsky, said morale is high. \u201cThe threats to send Russian peacekeepers into Ukraine have been around since April, but nothing happens,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Ukrainian Army is learning quickly how to fight. Volunteers who join the army want to defend this land. We are not afraid.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian military strategy, commanders say, centers on encircling Donetsk to squeeze off the lifeline of supplies from the other separatist stronghold, the city of Luhansk, and from the Russian border. On Saturday, a rebel website, citing the separatist military commander Igor Strelkov, said the Ukrainian Army had cut off resupply routes.\n\nThe fighting for Donetsk has taken on a lethal pattern: The regular army bombards separatist positions from afar, followed by chaotic, violent assaults by some of the half-dozen or so paramilitary groups surrounding Donetsk who are willing to plunge into urban combat.\n\nOfficials in Kiev say the militias and the army coordinate their actions, but the militias, which count about 7,000 fighters, are angry and, at times, uncontrollable. One known as Azov, which took over the village of Marinka, flies a neo-Nazi symbol resembling a Swastika as its flag.\n\nIn pressing their advance, the fighters took their orders from a local army commander, rather than from Kiev. In the video of the attack, no restraint was evident. Gesturing toward a suspected pro-Russian position, one soldier screamed, \u201cThe bastards are right there!\u201d Then he opened fire."}
