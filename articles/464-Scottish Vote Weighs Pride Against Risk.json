{"title": "Scottish Vote Weighs Pride Against Risk", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger", "Katrin Bennhold"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/world/europe/scotland-independence-referendum.html", "body": "Alyn Smith, a pro-independence Scottish member of the European Parliament and a former corporate lawyer, said that the British government did what was best for the United Kingdom, not necessarily for Scotland. \u201cThe U.K. does not incentivize how to grow the Scottish economy, but the U.K. economy,\u201d he said.\n\nVideo\n\nThose opposed to independence, called the \u201cBetter Together\u201d campaign, have focused so much on the potentially negative effects of independence that many Scots seem to have simply stopped listening, or decided that they prefer the reassurances of Alex Salmond, the leader of the independence movement. Mr. Salmond maintains that Scotland can stand on its own, that the British government is \u201cbluffing\u201d when it says it has ruled out a currency union, and that the European Union is exaggerating the difficulties Scotland would face in joining the bloc as a new member.\n\n\u201cThe no campaign has been prophesying that the sky will fall for so long that it\u2019s just all noise and not credible anymore,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nThere is resentment, too, among independence supporters at what is seen as dismissive attitudes of British elites. They point to an appearance in Scotland in February by the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, when he declared that it would be impossible for Britain to have a currency union with an independent Scotland \u2014 but took no questions on the topic, one of the most important of the campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople were offended that this politician from southern England, with no real standing in Scotland, should talk to us in those terms,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nIain Macwhirter, a columnist for The Sunday Herald newspaper, called Mr. Osborne\u2019s visit a turning point in the campaign. Why is \u201cProject Fear\u201d not working? he asked. \u201cWhy have so many Scots refused to heed the warnings of press, politicians and banks?\u201d His answer: \u201cWell, in a nutshell, George Osborne happened.\u201d\n\nThose who favor independence argue that Scotland is politically and culturally alienated from a government in London dominated by the Conservatives and the power of money. Many in left-leaning Scotland say a yes vote would bring them not only autonomy but also a more Scandinavian-style social democracy \u2014 nuclear free and more equitable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome in the yes campaign seem to be making quasi-economic arguments of their own, selling Scotland as a socialist paradise of enhanced benefits fueled by endless amounts of North Sea oil and gas.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the warnings of British and international economists are not easily dismissed. They tend to center on questions of the currency, budget deficits, energy resources and relatively lower growth in Scotland, as well as reduced clout in global affairs for a shrunken Britain.\n\nTight polls have many in Washington freshly alarmed, with the White House and many American heavyweights voicing strong support for keeping the United Kingdom together.\n\nThe no camp warns that Scotland would lose not just the British pound but a sizable chunk of its financial sector as banks and insurers flee south, taking jobs and capital with them. With the future of oil revenues uncertain and declining, an independent Scotland could not afford its current welfare state, let alone expand it, the argument goes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The new nation would be well-off to start with, but on course to grow poorer: Scotland has a G.D.P. per capita above most regions of Britain, lagging behind only London and the southeast of England. But Scottish productivity is 11 percent lower than in the rest of Britain, and its population is unhealthier and aging more rapidly. Mr. Salmond\u2019s plan to increase public spending by 3 percent a year means that even if the Scottish government spends all of its oil revenues, the hole in its finances will grow without higher taxes or higher-than-anticipated economic growth.\n\nIf the pro-independence side wins, economists predict, Scotland would face the uncertainty that would hang over 18 months of divorce negotiations, which will tackle thorny issues like the division of oil revenues, the national debt and the currency.\n\nThe currency has been the biggest flash point in recent months. Even left-leaning economists warn that a currency union that lacks a fiscal union and a true \u201clender of last resort\u201d would make Scotland vulnerable to the same risks that nearly undid the eurozone. Excluding oil, Scotland ran a public sector deficit of nearly 11 percent of its national income in 2012-13 \u2014 a bigger gap than in Greece or Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn psychological terms, independence represents a form of magical thinking,\u201d said Colin McLean, a Scottish fund manager. \u201cWithout understanding the precise mechanism, this single change represents a cure-all for widely conflicting aspirations ranging from growth to redistribution.\u201d\n\nNot all business leaders are against independence. Ken Beaty, a former investment strategist and a Scot, lives in England so cannot vote, but said he saw the struggle for Scots as hope versus fear. \u201cBut some things are worth taking risks for,\u201d he said.\n\nStephen Gethins, a former adviser to Mr. Salmond, said that economists were focused too much on the challenges of independence instead of on the opportunities presented by the Scottish resources of oil, gas and renewable energy through wind and waves; of whisky, food and tourism; of a thriving energy-services sector; and of a people that have traditionally exported their best minds to London and the world.\n\nMr. Gethins pointed to Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, who has dismissed most of the warnings, arguing in The Scotsman that \u201cindependence may have its costs \u2014 although these have yet to be demonstrated convincingly; but it will also have its benefits,\u201d which Scotland can recapture through the taxes it would not have to share with London.\n\nThe referendum allows those 16 and over to vote, and while younger voters are divided in their opinions, they also appear more likely to be optimistic and less likely to be swayed by economic arguments. Kate Macauley, 19, flew home to Glasgow from a summer job in Massachusetts to vote.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing sure, but I want to make our own way, to improve things we want to improve,\u201d she said. And if the noes win? \u201cI\u2019d be devastated,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d just hope that somehow we\u2019d have another chance.\u201d", "summary": "They tend to center on questions of the currency, budget deficits, energy resources and relatively lower growth in Scotland, as well as reduced clout in global affairs for a shrunken Britain.Mr. Greenspan, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, told The Financial Times this week that the economic consequences of independence would be \u201csurprisingly negative for Scotland, more so than the Nationalist Party is in any way communicating.\u201dIf the pro-independence side wins, economists predict, Scotland would face the uncertainty that would hang over 18 months of divorce negotiations, which will tackle thorny issues like the division of oil revenues, the national debt and the currency.Stephen Gethins, a former adviser to Mr. Salmond, said that economists were focused too much on the challenges of independence instead of on the opportunities presented by the Scottish resources of oil, gas and renewable energy through wind and waves; of whisky, food and tourism; of a thriving energy-services sector; and of a people that have traditionally exported their best minds to London and the world.Mr. Gethins pointed to Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, who has dismissed most of the warnings, arguing in The Scotsman that \u201cindependence may have its costs \u2014 although these have yet to be demonstrated convincingly; but it will also have its benefits,\u201d which Scotland can recapture through the taxes it would not have to share with London."}
