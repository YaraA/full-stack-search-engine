Only a year ago, Francis\u2019 calls to fight climate change and help migrants seemed to place him in the lead of a progressive global vanguard, in keeping with his push for a more welcoming church.\n\nNow, suddenly, he is more politically isolated. The election of President Trump and the rise of far-right populists in Europe have ushered in an angrier era \u2014 and emboldened traditionalists inside the Vatican who sense that the once-impregnable pope could be vulnerable.\n\nThe Knights of Malta is a bastion of Catholic tradition. Founded in the 11th century by Amalfian merchants to help Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land, it later became a military force, defending the faith during the Crusades and eventually holding off the armies of the Ottoman Empire from its fortress in Malta. The group, now with a wealthy and aristocratic membership of elite Catholics who parade in ornate raiment, has more recently specialized in aiding refugees and the poor in more than 100 countries.\n\nUntil this past week, the order was led by the conservative and elaborately titled His Most Eminent Highness the Prince and Grand Master of the Order of Malta, Matthew Festing of Britain, a former Sotheby\u2019s representative who had taken a monastic oath.\n\nLong-building tensions between Mr. Festing and the order\u2019s Grand Chancellor Albrecht von Boeselager of Germany, whose father participated in a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, escalated in recent months amid accusations that Mr. Boeselager had knowingly overseen the distribution of condoms as head of the order\u2019s charitable arm. Into this volatile situation stepped Cardinal Burke.\n\nIn 2014, Francis had demoted Cardinal Burke, a leader of the church\u2019s traditionalist movement, from his position on the Vatican\u2019s Supreme Court. The cardinal\u2019s supporters say Francis did this because of Cardinal Burke\u2019s opposition to the pope\u2019s tentative opening to the possibility of allowing divorced Catholics to receive communion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCardinal Burke\u2019s exile was at least a cushy one, as the pope named him as the Knights\u2019 patron and liaison to the Vatican, where he would be out of the way.\n\nBut the soft-spoken cardinal has made his presence felt.\n\nDuring the summer, as tensions mounted inside the order, Michael Hichborn, the president of the Lepanto Institute, a conservative Catholic organization in Virginia, conducted what he called a \u201cshort investigation\u201d into the order\u2019s international aid arm, which Mr. Boeselager oversaw.\n\nMr. Hichborn said he had discovered that the aid organization was promoting the use of condoms and other contraceptives in Africa and Myanmar, a violation of church rules.\n\n\u201cAs I was digging around I thought, \u2018Well, Cardinal Burke ought to know about this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hichborn said in an interview.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn November, he sent a summary to Cardinal Burke\u2019s office and said he was told that the cardinal \u201cwould be working on something\u201d regarding the information.\n\nA few days later, Cardinal Burke relayed his concerns about Mr. Boeselager to Francis. According to supporters of the cardinal, the pope then instructed him to root out from the order elements of Freemasonry, Vatican shorthand for adherents of a secular moral view. But other people familiar with the events inside the order said the pope had also urged Cardinal Burke and the order\u2019s leadership to settle the dispute through dialogue.\n\nInstead, Mr. Festing and Cardinal Burke met Mr. Boeselager on Dec. 6 and requested his resignation, claiming, Mr. Boeselager said in a statement, \u201cthat this was in accordance with the wishes of the Holy See.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Boeselager declined to comment for this article.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrancis was apparently not pleased about the firing and did not want the dispute to spill into the public, which it did when The Tablet, a Catholic publication in England, broke the news.\n\nThe pope was already critical of the ornate dress favored by the Knights (red military jacket and gold epaulets) and by Cardinal Burke (a long train of billowing red silk known as a cappa magna). Francis also had a history of run-ins with the Knights during his time as a cardinal in Argentina.\n\nSo on Dec. 21, Francis wrote directly to Mr. Festing, conveying his decisions on what he called the \u201cpainful circumstances\u201d and making clear that those decisions had \u201cvalue, regardless of anything else to the contrary.\u201d Attached to his letter, signed simply \u201cFrancesco,\u201d were more letters from his second-highest-ranking official, Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, stating that \u201cHis Holiness asked for dialogue as the way to confront and resolve eventual problems\u201d and that \u201che never spoke, instead, of kicking someone out!\u201d\n\nCardinal Parolin also wrote that the firing \u201cnot be attributed to the will of the pope.\u201d Critically, he noted that the Knights, because of the group\u2019s status as a lay religious order, fell under the pope\u2019s authority, and that the pope had formed a commission to investigate the firing of Mr. Boeselager. But Mr. Festing refused to comply with the papal commission, citing the order\u2019s status as a sovereign entity and raising questions about the integrity of a commission full of Mr. Boeselager\u2019s allies.\n\n\u201cI think maybe he was getting bad advice\u201d from Cardinal Burke, said one senior Vatican official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak by the Vatican. (Cardinal Burke and Mr. Festing declined to comment.)\n\nOthers say Mr. Festing hardly needed to be egged on by Cardinal Burke, and note that despite having no territory, the order is, in fact, sovereign, issuing its own passports and stamps and conducting diplomatic missions.\n\nEither way, the Vatican was not thrilled. On Jan. 17, it issued an unusually tough statement supporting the commission and rejecting \u201cany attempt to discredit these members of the group and their work.\u201d The commission ultimately ruled that the pope did have authority over the Knights of Malta.\n\nOn Tuesday, he exercised it. He called Mr. Festing to the Vatican and asked for him to step down, a move the Vatican announced the next day. The order followed with its own statement, saying Mr. Festing\u2019s resignation would become official once the order\u2019s counselors met on Via dei Condotti to formally accept it. On Saturday, they did just that, immediately reinstating Mr. Boeselager and promising to collaborate with the pope\u2019s delegate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis delighted the pope\u2019s supporters, who said it showed that conniving conservatives would not push him around.\n\nBut supporters of Mr. Festing were horrified by the Vatican\u2019s de facto takeover. Supporters of Cardinal Burke complained that the pope, for all his talk of fostering debate, was intolerant of opposing views, especially more orthodox ones.\n\n\u201cIt sends a message to the rest of the Catholic world that if you try to stand for orthodoxy in the church, you are going to be sent away,\u201d Mr. Hichborn said. \u201cAnd the people pushing for heterodoxy will be put in power.\u201d\n\nWhat was not up for debate was that, in the Vatican, Francis gets his way.\n\nAt the order\u2019s headquarters, a stately wooden mailbox hangs on the doorman\u2019s wall. The three top slots are reserved for the order\u2019s top three officials. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Boeselager\u2019s name had been erased. Mr. Festing\u2019s would soon be gone.\n\nThe third slot belonged to the order\u2019s interim leader, Grand Commander Ludwig Hoffmann von Rumerstein. But only, a Vatican statement made clear, \u201cpending the appointment of the papal delegate.\u201d", "summary": "Only a year ago, Francis\u2019 calls to fight climate change and help migrants seemed to place him in the lead of a progressive global vanguard, in keeping with his push for a more welcoming church.
