If the tip was to be believed, he was in France.\n\nThe authorities pored over telephone and banking records, Mr. Molins said. One clue led to another, until the authorities concluded that it was likely that Mr. Abbaoud was holed up in St.-Denis, the suburb on the northern edge of Paris where the attacks began last Friday night at 9:20 p.m. with a suicide explosion at the nearby national soccer stadium.\n\nAt 4:20 a.m. Paris time on Wednesday, police assault teams stormed the three-story building on the Rue du Corbillon, which local officials and neighbors described as a drug-infested and dangerous street that has many squatters.\n\nVideo\n\nBacked by truckloads of soldiers, 110 officers from two special police units cordoned off an area near the Place Jean Jaur\u00e8s, a main square in the medieval heart of the city.\n\nDjamila Khaldi, a 54-year-old cashier who lives near the basilica, was preparing to take her daughter to the airport when the gunfire erupted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Khaldi said she was not surprised the police had tracked the suspects to the neighborhood. She said a friend of hers believed she had seen Mr. Abdeslam on Monday.\n\n\u201cShe was terrified, and she looked at another woman knowing that she recognized him too,\u201d Ms. Khaldi said. \u201cThey did not dare to go to the police.\u201d\n\nThe police conducted a simultaneous raid on the nearby Boulevard Carnot, the home of someone identified as having been in contact with the people at the Rue du Corbillon. The apartment was empty and no weapons were found there, but a man and a woman outside the apartment were detained.\n\nBefore he was handcuffed and led away by the police, the man told Agence France-Presse that he had lent the apartment to the men as a favor to a friend: \u201cI said that there was no mattress, they told me, \u2018It\u2019s not a problem,\u2019 they just wanted water and to pray.\u201d\n\nSt.-Denis, a city of 118,000, is known for its melting-pot population and large Muslim community, as well as a Gothic basilica where many French monarchs are buried.\n\nAs the raids were being carried out, the police shouted at pedestrians to get off the street or seek cover; officers even broke through the door of a small church, St.-Denys de l\u2019Estr\u00e9e, chasing down what turned out to be a false alarm.\n\nAt 11:47 a.m., after more than seven hours, a government spokesman, St\u00e9phane Le Foll, declared that the operation was over. Five police officers were slightly wounded, and a 7-year-old police dog, a Malinois named Diesel, was killed.\n\nPrime Minister Manuel Valls, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Justice Minister Christiane Taubira had joined President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to monitor the operation.\n\nVideo\n\nThe raid was just the most spectacular of an aggressive counterterrorism campaign the French government has been conducting since Friday night. Officials said Wednesday that they had identified all 129 who were killed Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cazeneuve said Wednesday that the police had conducted 414 raids across the country over the past three nights. Sixty people have been arrested and detained, and 75 weapons seized, including 11 heavy weapons, 33 long firearms and 31 handguns, the statement said. An additional 118 people were put under house arrest.\n\nOfficials have been piecing together the planning for the attacks. They said that some of the plotters had rented a house in the northeast Paris suburb of Bobigny, and others took a hotel suite in the southeast Paris suburb of Alfortville.\n\nMr. Molins said a cellphone found in a trash can near the Bataclan concert hall, where 89 people died Friday, had led the police to the Alfortville hotel. The phone contained a text message \u2014 \u201con est parti on commence\u201d \u2014 that loosely translates as \u201chere we go, we\u2019re starting\u201d or as \u201cwe have left, we\u2019re starting.\u201d\n\nMr. Molins said investigators had determined that the attackers arrived in Paris on Thursday in three cars rented by Mr. Abdeslam and his brother Ibrahim, who would blow himself up in a cafe on Friday night after shooting numerous Parisians in bars and restaurants.\n\nVideo\n\nAfter the raids, Mr. Hollande told a conference of French mayors that the operation \u201cconfirms that we are at war.\u201d He said he would travel to Washington next week to meet with President Obama, and to Moscow two days later to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, to discuss the formation of \u201ca large coalition\u201d to act \u201cdecisively\u201d against the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.\n\n\u201cDaesh has financial and oil resources, and has created young radical Islamists through complicity in Europe and within our own country,\u201d Mr. Hollande told the gathering, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cTheir attacks bloodied Paris and St.-Denis,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it is the entire country that has been attacked.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Hollande declared a state of emergency on Friday and has sought sweeping new authority, including constitutional amendments, which he says would make it easier to fight terrorism. On Wednesday, he said the government would help the mayors equip and arm local police officers. He also said that the government was introducing legislation that would make it possible to \u201cimmediately\u201d dissolve organizations that glorify terrorism.\n\n\u201cI say it firmly: France will remain the country of liberty, of movements, of culture,\u201d he said. \u201cAn active, valiant, dynamic country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would France be without its museums, without its terraces, without its concerts, without its sports competitions?\u201d he added.\n\nBelgium, where Mr. Abaaoud is believed to have organized the attacks, remained on a state of high alert on Wednesday. The number of federal police officers patrolling Brussels will be doubled starting Thursday, to 40 from 20 during the day, and to 30 from 15 at night, Interior Minister Jan Jambon announced.\n\nMolenbeek, a working-class Brussels neighborhood, was the base for Mr. Abaaoud, the plotting suspect, and for the Abdeslam brothers. (A third brother, Mohamed, who lives there, was not involved in the attacks and has pleaded for Salah to turn himself in.)\n\nIn Molenbeek on Wednesday, some 2,000 people gathered in the market square, not far from where Mr. Abaaoud grew up, to mourn the victims of the Paris attacks. Security was tight \u2014 police frisked everyone upon entering \u2014 but the vigil went on without incident.", "summary": "The breakthrough appeared to have come with a tip on Monday night: Mr. Abbaoud, an Islamic State militant linked to a series of previous attacks, was not in Syria, as some intelligence officials had thought, or his native Belgium.
