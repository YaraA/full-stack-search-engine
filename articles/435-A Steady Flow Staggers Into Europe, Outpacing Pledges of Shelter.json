In Germany, which has been accepting by far the largest number of arrivals, Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to set aside $6.7 billion to deal with the crisis.\n\nThe numbers those European nations have agreed to accept are much smaller than the numbers of those who have entered the Continent, and who continue to arrive. And many countries, especially in Eastern Europe, are balking at accepting more than a token number.\n\nMr. Hollande said a plan was expected to be presented on Wednesday by the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive arm, that would redistribute 120,000 people across the 28-nation bloc over the next two years.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is the duty of France, where the right to asylum is entirely part of its soul, of its flesh,\u201d Mr. Hollande said.\n\nThe European Union, he said, needed to create \u201chot spot\u201d reception centers at those borders under the greatest onslaught \u2014 in Greece, Italy and Hungary \u2014 to register new arrivals and turn back those who do not meet the requirements for asylum.\n\nMr. Cameron said Monday that Britain would accept up to 20,000 Syrian refugees, but they would most likely be limited to those who apply for asylum from camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The British government is wary of giving migrants any incentive to make the dangerous journey into Europe, officials said, and do not wish to favor more well-to-do refugees who can afford the trip.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChallenged by Harriet Harman, acting leader of the opposition Labour Party, to say how many would be admitted this year, officials declined to give a specific target.\n\nSeveral other British lawmakers criticized the announcement, with some calling for the number to be increased. \u201cThe offer of 20,000 refugees over five years amounts to just 12 refugees a day, which falls pitifully short of what is needed and of what people in this country deserve and expect,\u201d said Caroline Lucas, a lawmaker for the Green Party.\n\nIn Germany, Ms. Merkel said that \u201cwhat we are experiencing now is something that will occupy and change our country in coming years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want that the change is positive, and we believe we can accomplish that,\u201d she added.\n\nHungary, which has taken a much harder line than most European nations, continued to reject demands that all countries accept quotas.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly said that Hungary has the right to protect its Christian traditions by refusing to accept large numbers of Muslims, and that many of the arrivals making their way to Germany and other prosperous nations do not deserve asylum.\n\n\u201cWe have to face the reality that these people do not simply want refugee status,\u201d he told a gathering of diplomats on Monday. \u201cThey are really after the German way of life.\u201d\n\nYet strains were beginning to show in the Hungarian government. On Monday, Csaba Hende, Hungary\u2019s defense minister, submitted his resignation after a national security meeting, and Mr. Orban accepted it, the state news agency reported.\n\nMr. Hende had been responsible, along with the minister of the interior, for construction of the border fence. Mr. Orban had asked that it be completed by the end of August, but only a first stage, a line of razor wire along the ground, had been completed by then, with the bulk of the 13-foot barrier still being built. Those arriving Monday in Roszke could listen, as they walked along the rail tracks through the gap in the fence, to the clang of a pile driver sinking metal poles into the loamy ground just a few hundred yards away.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis year alone, more than 150,000 migrants have requested asylum in Hungary. The latest figures from the government show that the largest number, 53,467, came from Syria, with 41,094 from Afghanistan, 24,554 from Kosovo and the rest from Iraq, Pakistan, Eritrea and other troubled nations.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In Spain, a day after the police clashed with migrants at a detention center in the eastern city of Valencia, the regional government called on the authorities to investigate the episode, including reports that the police had fired rubber bullets to regain control.\n\nIn Denmark, the police stopped a Copenhagen-bound train carrying about 100 migrants. Passengers with valid passports and visas were shifted to another train while the migrants were held.\n\nThe move was in reaction to an influx of migrants that came from Hungary over the weekend, a police official said. The first few dozen agreed to board buses to reception centers where they were to be fed and given beds and access to showers while they went through registration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDuring registration, you will be interviewed and you will be asked your desires \u2014 if you want to seek asylum or not,\u201d an officer told them.\n\nThe group \u2014 which was on its way to Norway and Sweden \u2014 included Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis and Iranians who had made their way over the weekend from Budapest\u2019s Keleti train station.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here,\u201d said Nasser Taha, 21, from Tripoli, Libya. \u201cI have no language, no work, no people.\u201d\n\nAt the camp near Roszke, migrants waited Monday for bus rides to the nearby processing center where they would be registered and then sent north. Angry groups, weary of the delays, marched on the line of police officers blocking their exit, chanting \u201cFreedom! Freedom!\u201d They were repeatedly pushed back.\n\nTaha Shaben, 28, who said he fled Syria when his family\u2019s textile factory was bombed, scowled at those trying to muscle their way through.\n\n\u201cI am Syrian, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cA real Syrian. Here, we have Pakistanis, Afghans, Iraqis, and they all throw away their papers and claim to be Syrian.\u201d\n\nBeing from Syria is the surest path to refugee status. \u201cOh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is a Syrian now. It is a big problem.\u201d\n\nFive hundred yards down the railroad tracks, at the gap in the fence, a few dozen new arrivals rested before continuing on to the distant line of police officers and television crews.\n\n\u201cWe are lost; we have no cellphones,\u201d said Pierre Alshoufi, 18, who said he was a Christian from Hama, Syria. \u201cThey fell into the Greek sea. Please, what is up ahead? Can anyone tell us what will become of us?\u201d", "summary": "The European Union, he said, needed to create \u201chot spot\u201d reception centers at those borders under the greatest onslaught \u2014 in Greece, Italy and Hungary \u2014 to register new arrivals and turn back those who do not meet the requirements for asylum.
