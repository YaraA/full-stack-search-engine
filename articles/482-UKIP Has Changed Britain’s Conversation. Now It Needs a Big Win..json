Although polls suggest that it could win about 12 percent of the national vote, it might end up winning only two seats out of 650.\n\nBut by splitting the vote on the right, analysts say, it could deprive Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party of at least two dozen seats and potentially the ability to form a governing coalition.\n\nAs for Mr. Farage, the stakes could not be higher: Either he wins and takes his message from the fringes to the heart of British politics, or he loses and resigns as party chief, spelling a crisis for a movement that has become all but synonymous with his leadership.\n\nA former commodities trader with a smoker\u2019s cough and heaps of pub-counter charisma, Mr. Farage wants Britain to leave the European Union and blames immigrants for everything from scarce primary school places and hospital beds to a shortage of affordable housing.\n\nHe also promises to \u201cspot-fine\u201d all those who allow their dogs to foul the sidewalk 80 pounds (about $120).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI want my country back!\u201d Mr. Farage cried when he turned up in Ramsgate that recent morning.\n\nRamsgate\u2019s aging, white, working-class population feels left behind by globalization and mainstream politicians on the left and right, said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at Nottingham University. Mr. Farage, he said, \u201chas become a very good articulator for what a certain section of British society feels and thinks.\u201d\n\nOne of UKIP\u2019s election posters shows an escalator going up the white cliffs of Dover. A hallmark purple leaflet is blunter: \u201cOpen borders for convicted murderers from Europe to come in and out.\u201d In south Thanet, the number of immigrants is below the national average. But that is not how locals perceive it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s out of control,\u201d Trevor Jarmin, 49, said. He said that he had lost several jobs to Polish workers willing to work for lower wages. Alan Bessant, 59, a former soldier, said his neighbors had trouble getting their children a place in school.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSome of us had operations refused because immigrants jump the queue in hospital,\u201d he added.\n\nMany of those supporting Mr. Farage here used to vote Conservative. Others have never cast a ballot before. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the point \u2014 the politicians, they\u2019re all the same, they don\u2019t care about ordinary people,\u201d said Matt Thomas, 28, a bricklayer. \u201cBut from what I\u2019ve seen from Nigel Farage, I thought, \u2018Yeah, I like what he\u2019s saying. He sounds like one of us.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPrivately educated and married to a German, Mr. Farage has little in common with the bricklayers and builders whose vote he courts. But his appeals to join the \u201cPeople\u2019s Army\u201d have proved effective \u2014 as have countless televised outings to the pub. \u201cHe talks like us, he drinks like us,\u201d Simon Harper, a local fisherman, observed approvingly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It went on to secure its first two seats in the British Parliament after two Conservative lawmakers defected to UKIP and held their districts in subsequent by-elections.\n\nMr. Farage, 51, has since made a habit of selling fruitcakes at election meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s Nigel\u2019s favorite insult,\u201d a local party member said at one such meeting last week.\n\nMr. Cameron has worked hard to beat Mr. Farage \u2014 at times by co-opting elements of his message. He embraced Mr. Farage\u2019s anti-European Union rallying cry, promising a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the bloc by 2017, and has proposed barring immigrants from receiving welfare benefits until they have been in the country for four years (UKIP\u2019s proposal is five years).\n\nThe Conservative candidate running against Mr. Farage in south Thanet is Craig Mackinlay, a co-founder of UKIP who later left the party. He courts voters in part by arguing that the Conservatives are in a better position to deliver on Mr. Farage\u2019s priorities, some of which, like leaving the European Union, he still shares.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot to be outdone, the Labour Party has pledged to hire 1,000 new border guards, and it, too, vows to limit benefits to recent immigrants.\n\nWhile UKIP\u2019s natural base of support tends to be on the right, it is beginning to recruit among traditional Labour voters. \u201cThe Champagne socialists that lead the Labour Party have betrayed their core supporters,\u201d said Christine Gall, who said she grew up in a \u201cSocialist household\u201d and was now campaigning for UKIP.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut if Mr. Farage can already claim one victory \u2014 shifting the political agenda \u2014 there is no certainty that he will win in south Thanet.\n\nA series of gaffes and local scandals have not helped. Last year, the UKIP parliamentary candidate for nearby Dover, David Little, posted a spoof UKIP map of the world on Facebook that renamed Africa \u201cBongo-Bongo Land.\u201d\n\nIt then emerged that Martyn Heale, the local party secretary, used to be a member of the National Front, a far-right group with links to the neo-Nazi movement. (\u201cIt\u2019s not like I was a member of the Gestapo,\u201d Mr. Heale said in his defense.) And UKIP\u2019s first elected local councilor here, Rozanne Duncan, was hastily expelled from the party after saying in front of a rolling BBC camera that she had a \u201cproblem\u201d with \u201cNegroes.\u201d\n\nMany in south Thanet say they do not want their area to become associated with those types of views.\n\nMichael John Holloway, a former British ambassador to Panama and a member of the Conservative Party, said he had been motivated to run for office in his hometown by Mr. Farage\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cThe thought of that man representing Sandwich when, for the last 30 years, I\u2019ve represented Britain abroad, advocating our values of inclusiveness,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cUKIP\u2019s brand is bigoted and divisive.\u201d\n\nMs. La Roche, the activist in Ramsgate, is no fan of the Conservatives, but her dislike of Mr. Farage trumps all else. \u201cI don\u2019t care who beats him,\u201d she said, \u201cas long as someone does.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt a public meeting last week in nearby Broadstairs, a stone\u2019s throw from where Charles Dickens wrote \u201cDavid Copperfield,\u201d Mr. Farage told about 170 mostly middle-aged and older voters not to listen to the \u201cdark propaganda\u201d against UKIP.\n\n\u201cOur crime is that we believe in Britain,\u201d he proclaimed to loud cheers. The country has been let down by governments on the left and right, he said.\n\nHave you noticed, he asked: \u201cAll they talk about is me.\u201d", "summary": "As for Mr. Farage, the stakes could not be higher: Either he wins and takes his message from the fringes to the heart of British politics, or he loses and resigns as party chief, spelling a crisis for a movement that has become all but synonymous with his leadership.A former commodities trader with a smoker\u2019s cough and heaps of pub-counter charisma, Mr. Farage wants Britain to leave the European Union and blames immigrants for everything from scarce primary school places and hospital beds to a shortage of affordable housing.Once dismissed as \u201ca bunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\u201d by Mr. Cameron, UKIP rattled Britain\u2019s political establishment last May by winning nearly 28 percent of the vote in elections for the European Parliament, more than any other party.Michael John Holloway, a former British ambassador to Panama and a member of the Conservative Party, said he had been motivated to run for office in his hometown by Mr. Farage\u2019s candidacy.At a public meeting last week in nearby Broadstairs, a stone\u2019s throw from where Charles Dickens wrote \u201cDavid Copperfield,\u201d Mr. Farage told about 170 mostly middle-aged and older voters not to listen to the \u201cdark propaganda\u201d against UKIP."}
