{"title": "With Jeremy Corbyn Elected as New Leader, Britain\u2019s Labour Party Takes a Hard Left Turn", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/world/europe/labour-party-election-jeremy-corbyn.html", "body": "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be unequal, it doesn\u2019t have to be unfair, poverty isn\u2019t inevitable,\u201d Mr. Corbyn told a cheering audience in a short acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cThings can change and they will change,\u201d he added, denouncing \u201cgrotesque\u201d levels of inequality and placing blame for the migration crisis currently sweeping Europe on the bitter legacy of going to war. One of his first acts, Mr. Corbyn said, will be to attend a demonstration in London to highlight the plight of refugees.\n\nMr. Corbyn\u2019s perceived integrity and his willingness to speak his mind have struck a chord in a party in which many supporters were left disillusioned by the leadership of Mr. Blair, whose decision to join President George W. Bush in invading Iraq poisoned his legacy. Yet Mr. Blair is one of only a handful of Labour leaders who has ever won a general election, and Mr. Corbyn\u2019s critics fear he will turn the Labour Party into a protest movement, rather than a realistic alternative to the Conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning how to grit my teeth and bite my tongue,\u201d one Labour lawmaker, who asked not to be named to avoid alienating Mr. Corbyn, said outside the conference center where the results were made public.\n\nHow long Mr. Corbyn\u2019s critics stay quiet remains to be seen. His parliamentary record as a serial rebel who frequently defied the party line will also make it hard for him to appeal for loyalty.\n\nYet the scale of his win may give Mr. Corbyn some time to establish his leadership. In fact Mr. Corbyn, a vegetarian and teetotaler, had to be persuaded to run as the left\u2019s leadership candidate, and he nearly failed to make the ballot paper.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The party, which had around 187,000 members before the May general election, has gained more than 105,000 since, plus 112,000 \u201cregistered supporters.\u201d When those affiliated with the party, mainly through unions, are added, more than half a million people had the right to vote, and more than 420,000 ultimately took part.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Saturday, political opponents moved quickly to condemn Labour\u2019s leftward shift. Michael Fallon, the defense secretary, described the opposition party as \u201ca serious risk to our nation\u2019s security, our economy\u2019s security and your family\u2019s security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s weakening our defenses, raising taxes on jobs and earnings, racking up more debt and welfare or driving up the cost of living by printing money \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party will hurt working people,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMore worrying for Mr. Corbyn will be internal critics. Steven Fielding, professor of political history at Nottingham University, said that the emphatic nature of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s victory made it likely that his opponents would keep quiet for some months, and hope for him to trip up.\n\n\u201cI think there will be some kind of cease-fire, and that they will see how it goes, assuming that in six to 12 months, Labour\u2019s opinion poll position will start to fall, and then they can start acting more assertively,\u201d Mr. Fielding said.\n\nDoing so more quickly might risk the wrath of the party supporters, many of whom have been energized by Mr. Corbyn\u2019s campaign, Mr. Fielding added.\n\nOn Saturday they thronged the conference center where the results were announced, some cheering or chanting.\n\nAmong those supporting the new leader was Sean Maher, a telecom executive from London, who said he had lost interest in the party during the 1990s because of the policies pursued by Mr. Blair, whom he likened to a Conservative.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of winning elections by being Conservative?\u201d he said. By contrast, Mr. Corbyn, \u201coffers a great deal of hope, and it has been a long time coming.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Corbyn\u2019s perceived integrity and his willingness to speak his mind have struck a chord in a party in which many supporters were left disillusioned by the leadership of Mr. Blair, whose decision to join President George W.
