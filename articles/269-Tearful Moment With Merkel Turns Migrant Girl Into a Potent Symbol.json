These changes, Ms. Ozoguz continued, would \u201cconclude years of uncertainty for many of those and their families who have temporary visas and have long since found their new homes here.\u201d\n\nReem counts herself among those recent arrivals who feel at home in Germany. \u201cI\u2019ve been treated well,\u201d she said, perched on a pink bedspread populated by stuffed animals.\n\nShe, her two younger siblings and her parents live in an anonymous housing block outside the city center. The apartment was provided by the government. Reem\u2019s parents are prohibited from working while their asylum application is under review, and the family lives on a small government subsidy.\n\nReem, speaking in fluent German after five years in the country, said she wished to study and to live permanently in Germany. She wants to work as an interpreter or English teacher so she can help others overcome communication barriers that she herself knows well. \u201cI see how needed it is when immigrants arrive here,\u201d Reem said.\n\nShe was born in a refugee camp in Baalbek, Lebanon, in 2000. Her birth was two months premature, and she has a shortened Achilles tendon and cerebral palsy that has partly paralyzed her left side and made walking difficult.\n\nPhoto\n\nHer father, Atef Sahwil, struggled to pay her medical bills on what he made as a welder. In the summer of 2006, as the war between Israel and Hezbollah upended their lives in Baalbek, the Sahwils fled to Syria for a few months, living in another refugee camp. After the family returned to Lebanon, Reem broke her right leg in a car accident.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt had to be my healthy leg,\u201d she said, laughing and pointing to a thick scar on her forehead, another reminder of the crash.\n\nAfter years of insufficient care, the Sahwils applied for a visa for medical treatment in Germany in 2010 and flew to D\u00fcsseldorf for an operation on Reem\u2019s back. Her family paid for the trip with money lent by Mr. Sahwil\u2019s employer, as well as with donations from the Red Cross, relatives and neighbors. \u201cWe approached strangers, just knocking on the door and asking for help,\u201d Reem said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Reem said that although the application was rejected \u2014 as she told Ms. Merkel during their tearful encounter \u2014 the family is appealing for additional consideration.\n\nRegardless of the result of those efforts, Roland Methling, the mayor of Rostock, has said he will do everything in his power to help families in his jurisdiction like the Sahwils remain in Germany. \u201cGermany, Europe and especially Palestine needs figures like Reem,\u201d Mr. Methling wrote in an email.\n\nReem attends a school with accommodations for disabled students. Her summer vacation began this week.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m in school, I feel like I\u2019m doing something for my life,\u201d she said. She said that her favorite subjects are English and German, in which she was the only student in her class this year to receive a grade of 1, equivalent to an A.\n\nReem was one of several students invited to participate in the public forum with the chancellor last Wednesday, part of a discussion series called Living Well in Germany.\n\n\u201cPolitics is sometimes hard,\u201d the chancellor said, a remark that some commentators have said showed a lack of empathy. Others have applauded Ms. Merkel\u2019s candor \u2014 including Reem herself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cShe was honest, and I find that good,\u201d Reem said.", "summary": "An overhaul of residency laws would allow certain under-age asylum seekers who have attended German schools and have been assimilated the opportunity to stay in the country permanently, along with their parents.
