Both are being put to the test as never before.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs with the euro, borderless travel was pushed ahead by the European Union as an essentially political idea, without Brussels having created the rules and institutions capable of coherently maintaining and enforcing it.\n\nAnd as with the euro, the chaos over the refugees has raised questions about not only how the European Union functions but what it stands for, not least its aspirations to balance justice and security.\n\n\u201cPeople want to see both compassion and competence from the E.U., and those two things should not be at odds,\u201d said David Miliband, a former British foreign minister and now director of the International Rescue Committee, a nongovernmental agency that helps refugees. \u201cIf the E.U. is incompetent, compassion is not enough.\u201d\n\nFormed as a peaceful, humane response to the blood bath of World War II, the bloc has always prided itself on its commitment to decency, including a traditional welcome among member states to accepting refugees.\n\nBut the surge of migrants has shredded that welcome and challenged the principles \u2014 and many of the practical benefits \u2014 of the Schengen zone. Austria, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia have all re-established border controls, at least temporarily, in recent weeks.\n\nThere is a growing recognition that Schengen can function only if its outermost borders are secure \u2014 as well as mounting evidence that they are not. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council and a former prime minister of Poland, wrote European Union leaders last weekend that \u201cwe as Europeans are currently not able to manage our common external borders.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She then won praise for humanitarian generosity by ignoring European Union rules and throwing open Germany\u2019s borders to Syrian asylum seekers. But that commitment faded once she was challenged by the Christian Socialists, her party\u2019s partners in Bavaria, which was bearing the brunt of the flow.\n\n\u201cThen the decision comes that Germany will have to reintroduce border controls, even on the border with France, and then all the other countries follow suit,\u201d Mr. Stanzel said.\n\nSolidarity is at risk, Mr. Stefanini, the former Italian ambassador, agreed.\n\n\u201cWe talk about how when you join the E.U., you accept that you have to share responsibilities as well as advantages,\u201d he said. \u201cCountries like Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and some others react as if when they joined they didn\u2019t sign up to share thousands of asylum seekers, or impose collective sanctions on Russia over Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you join, all of a sudden you realize you can\u2019t make all decisions on your own as before,\u201d he said, \u201cand that Schengen is great, but that you also lose control over your borders.\u201d\n\nThe European Union \u201cis not particularly good at dealing with the sort of crisis that demands quick action,\u201d Mr. Stefanini said.\n\n\u201cThe old European method is negotiations to seek consensus, and that takes time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here, as with Greece, you need quick decisions, you need to decide whether you do or you don\u2019t. Instead, we\u2019re wobbling along from the Greek crisis to this one, which is even more fundamental.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Stanzel, the former German ambassador, said he was convinced that Europe would work out an arrangement, which will probably include reception centers in front-line countries like Greece, Hungary and Italy to feed, house and screen migrants and asylum seekers, and then distribute legitimate refugees to member countries.\n\nThough forced to accept quotas for refugees, Eastern countries know that most of them will later travel to Germany or other countries in the Schengen area. Even if the Czechs are forced to take 5,000, \u201cthey know 3,000 of them will leave anyway \u2014 it\u2019s cynical but it will work,\u201d Mr. Stanzel said.\n\nBut in the longer term, he said, \u201cit will be a big challenge to security over time, and to the police agencies, and to those who must integrate the refugees.\u201d\n\nThere will also be a boon for the populist far-right, Mr. Stefanini said.\n\nThe National Front in France and the Northern League in Italy are \u201cbiding their time,\u201d he said. To come out now against refugees in the face of German and public generosity would be a mistake, which the populists realize.\n\n\u201cSo they say they\u2019re for legitimate refugees but against an open door to Europe,\u201d Mr. Stefanini said. \u201cBut there will be incidents and backlash, and then they will come out, and it will play into their hands.\u201d", "summary": "But with the prime minister of Slovakia immediately threatening to defy the plan, the outcome was more than an example of the bloc\u2019s inability to coordinate its policies \u2014 formidable enough through the long crisis over the euro and Greece\u2019s debt.
