Illegal migrants will no longer pass along this route.\u201d\n\nMr. Oreskovic said the agreement with Turkey had reduced the incentive for migrants to head to Europe. Like other leaders, he attributed the problem to traffickers who lure migrants into taking dangerous voyages across the Aegean Sea. \u201cIn what way can we destroy this business model?\u201d he asked.\n\nIceland Schengen area countries pol.

Very few have applied for asylum in the Balkan countries.\n\nThe shutdown of the migrant corridor is consistent with an effort by Brussels to restore order after the asylum system broke down last year.\n\nUnder the agreement with Turkey, any unauthorized migrant arriving in Greece will be automatically sent back to Turkey, and for each Syrian sent back, the European Union will resettle a Syrian refugee from Turkey.\n\nThe European Union has also pledged to expand humanitarian aid to help Turkey deal with the 2.7 million Syrian migrants living there; to expedite visa-free travel for Turks; and to reopen long-stalled negotiations over Turkey\u2019s application to join the 28-nation bloc.\n\nHuman rights groups, however, have objected to the European Union\u2019s proposed deal with Turkey, saying that returning asylum-seeking migrants en masse without first assessing their legal applications for refuge violates international law. About 2,000 migrants a day are entering Greece, observers have reported.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLots of misery here at Idomeni border as 13K are trapped, 2 days of rains forecast,\u201d Peter Bouckaert, the emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning, referring to the Greek village near the Macedonian border, where people have been pouring through in recent months under increasingly miserable conditions.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, Mr. Bouckaert said, migrants appeared to be leaving Idomeni for other points within Greece as word of the blocked route through the Balkans rippled through the encampments.\n\nThe situation in much of the region seemed wretched, though not nearly as bad as the scenes of migrants stranded at the Budapest train station and at a camp in Calais, France, that became known as the Jungle.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Many were women and children.\n\nGreece remains the largest bottleneck. Around 34,000 migrants are scattered around the country, on islands close to the Turkish coast; in the capital, Athens; and in the country\u2019s second-largest city, Thessaloniki.\n\nThe European Union has given tacit approval to the actions of these countries as it strives to restore order to the asylum-seeking process and to restore the integrity of the Schengen area, the 26-nation passport-free travel zone that is one of the bloc\u2019s most tangible accomplishments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSlovenia and Croatia are members of the European Union, and Serbia and Macedonia hope to join. Of the four countries, only Slovenia is part of the Schengen area. (Greece is also part of Schengen.)\n\nNatasha Bertaud, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive body, said Slovenia\u2019s decision to block refugees was part of the effort to restore order.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that third-country nationals who do not satisfy the entry conditions into the Schengen area, or who have not made an asylum request despite having had the opportunity to do so, will not be given entry into Slovenia,\u201d Ms. Bertaud said at a news conference.\n\nThe Slovenian policy was a step toward ending the \u201cwave-through approach,\u201d she added.", "summary": "France POLand Area of detail Spain AUStria HUNGary croatia romania Slavonski Brod Serbia slovenia bulgaria Idomeni MACEDONIA Thessaloniki greece Turkey ITALY Athens Human rights groups, however, have objected to the European Union\u2019s proposed deal with Turkey, saying that returning asylum-seeking migrants en masse without first assessing their legal applications for refuge violates international law.
