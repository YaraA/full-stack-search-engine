{"title": "Migrants Arriving in Germany Face a Chaotic Reception in Berlin", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy", "Katarina Johannsen"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/world/europe/germany-berlin-migrants-refugees.html", "body": "The scene has ranged from chaotic to downright dangerous. On a recent morning, two hours before the center opened, an ambulance wound its way through dozens of migrants huddled under blankets. A man had collapsed \u2014 it was unclear whether it was from the cold or from exhaustion.\n\nPolice officers have been brought in to back up private security guards after several migrants were injured trying to storm the gates. Rumors of guards accepting bribes are rampant.\n\nAnd it is from here that a 4-year-old boy from Bosnia disappeared last month \u2014 taken, the police said, by a man who confessed to kidnapping and killing him. The boy and his family were not among the tens of thousands of migrants who crossed Europe in recent months; they had been waiting for a decision on their asylum application for two years. They are now expected to be allowed to stay.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s Germany,\u201d said Yazan Smair, a 31-year-old student who fled Syria three months ago and has been granted asylum in Germany; he now volunteers as an interpreter outside the registration center. \u201cThey have a system for everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be an easier way.\u201d\n\nMore specifically, though, it is Berlin, where budget cuts and population growth taxed resources long before the arrival of asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Syria and other places. Klaus Wowereit, a former mayor, sought to attract creative types to the city by describing it as \u201cpoor but sexy\u201d \u2014 far from many migrants\u2019 experiences so far.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor two decades, Germany has sought to streamline its government, and nowhere has this been more visible than in Berlin. After the East and West sectors of the city were fused in 1990, its public work force was at 200,000. The city set out to halve that number, spinning off some services and downgrading others, so that by 2004, the number of employees had shrunk to 149,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven as the population grew, the number of city employees continued to drop. A decade later, there were just 117,000 of them, and those who remained complained that their ranks were too thin to provide needed social services to Berliners.\n\nAt the same time, inexpensive rents, extensive public transportation and the image of Berlin as one of Europe\u2019s hippest cities drew thousands of newcomers \u2014 175,000 from 2011 to 2014. City planners had projected that Berlin would have another 175,000 arrivals over the next 15 years, but that estimate did not account for the thousands of migrants.\n\nOver that same period, affordable housing grew scarce. The glut of apartments after reunification led the city to reduce subsidies for low-income housing. Because of growing demand for housing, rents have shot up 7.7 percent in the past two years. And although city-owned housing companies plan 30,000 new apartments for 2016, that number was formulated before so many newcomers landed at Berlin\u2019s doorstep, many sent there by the federal government from points south.\n\nLast month, Berlin\u2019s mayor, Michael M\u00fcller, tried to reassure residents that the city was financially stable enough to meet everyone\u2019s needs. \u201cWe have many social problems in our city \u2014 that I can\u2019t deny,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said on RBB state radio. \u201cWe have unemployed, we have the homeless.\u201d However, he added: \u201cWe have many different social services to help people who need it. That is important to me.\u201d\n\nBut the scene at the state office reflects a city that is stretched, if not overwhelmed.\n\nThose who know the situation best \u2014 the volunteers who donate their time and energy to feed, clothe and counsel the new arrivals \u2014 worry that city administrators are failing to ensure the migrants\u2019 welfare.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe need to work hard, otherwise we will see the first people dying of cold,\u201d said Victoria Baxter of Moabit Hilft, an organization formed over the summer to help asylum seekers left waiting for hours in the sun without sufficient water or food.\n\nBerlin\u2019s role as a city of refuge has dominated much of its post-World War II history. West Berlin served as a haven in the heart of East Germany for people fleeing communism, predominantly in the 1960s; for Tamils escaping civil war in Sri Lanka in the 1980s; and for pacifists from West Germany seeking to avoid compulsory military service.\n\nBut Europe has not seen migration of this scope since World War II. In Berlin alone, a city of 3.5 million, more than 62,000 people have arrived to seek asylum this year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That includes money for language classes, transportation and medical services, as well as for hiring and training more people to process applications.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA former state bank building that was repurposed as a new, integrated registration center opened in October. Asylum seekers can submit their applications, undergo required medical examinations and, eventually, consult with officials from the labor office about possible jobs.\n\nCity officials say the new system has allowed them to process as many as 700 applicants a day, compared with fewer than half that number this summer, when new arrivals first picked up.\n\n\u201cThe processing of the applications for asylum is moving ahead with full power,\u201d Mario Czaja, Berlin\u2019s senator for health and social services, told the Berlin public radio station Radio Eins on Monday. \u201cWe have taken big steps to improve.\u201d\n\nBut those seeking to apply for asylum, or to secure social benefits, must still brave the courtyard to start the process. Only newcomers who have arrived since mid-October can qualify for the new system, leaving a backlog of several thousand people, like Mr. Aswam and his family, still waiting at the old center.\n\nLast week, Berlin\u2019s department for health and social services instituted new rules aimed at easing the crush outside the registration center, including allowing one member of a household to apply for a whole family and prioritizing those who have been waiting the longest.\n\nToryalay Jamshidi, an 18-year-old from Afghanistan, said he had waited five days and nights just to acquire the gray plastic bracelet needed to board the bus to the new processing center. During the wait, he said, he slept on the street some nights.\n\nSince the temperatures dropped below freezing, women and children have been allowed to wait in heated tents. Yet volunteers worry that too many people are still left at the end of the day with nowhere to sleep.\n\nOlivia Mandeau has been volunteering at night over the past two months, helping to distribute blankets and warm clothing as well as organizing emergency shelter for migrants on the street.\n\n\u201cNowhere else in Germany is this a problem \u2014 every other city manages to find everyone a roof over their heads,\u201d Ms. Mandeau said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is not a refugee crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an administration crisis.\u201d", "summary": "Those who know the situation best \u2014 the volunteers who donate their time and energy to feed, clothe and counsel the new arrivals \u2014 worry that city administrators are failing to ensure the migrants\u2019 welfare. \u201cWe need to work hard, otherwise we will see the first people dying of cold,\u201d said Victoria Baxter of Moabit Hilft, an organization formed over the summer to help asylum seekers left waiting for hours in the sun without sufficient water or food.
