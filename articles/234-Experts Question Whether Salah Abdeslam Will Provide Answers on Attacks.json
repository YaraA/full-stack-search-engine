He backed out of the Paris attacks, yet the authorities say he returned immediately to the Brussels terrorist cell that is believed to have been tied to the Islamic State, instead of turning himself in.\n\nHe failed to give any hint of the Tuesday bombings, though he was in custody and being questioned by the police.\n\nMr. Abdeslam, a Belgian-born French citizen of Moroccan ancestry, has now reversed course on an initial refusal to be extradited to France.\n\nVideo\n\nFrench officials say his extradition is now a near-certainty, though they are unable to give an exact timetable.\n\nBut when he does make it back into the hands of the Paris antiterrorism investigators, he could be an unreliable witness at best, some experts suggested. His accounts \u2014 if he gives them \u2014 should be treated with caution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWill he accept cooperation?\u201d said Jacques Poinas, a former top French antiterrorism police official. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould he really have that much knowledge of the other cells? Was his role that important?\u201d Mr. Poinas asked.\n\nAnd, in the view of some terrorism experts, Mr. Abdeslam, 26, is likely to have been in some sort of disgrace for having pulled back from \u201cmartyrdom.\u201d\n\nAsked why Mr. Abdeslam had changed his mind on extradition, Mr. Mary said that his client understood \u201cthe case here is just a small piece,\u201d and that he wanted to \u201cexplain himself in France.\u201d\n\nAs for what his client had said about the attacks, Mr. Mary replied, \u201cHe didn\u2019t say, because he didn\u2019t know it.\u201d Asked if Mr. Abdeslam had reacted to the attacks, Mr. Mary said. \u201cHe had no reaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want him to clam up,\u201d Mr. Mary added. \u201cHis clamming up would make us face other Zaventems and other Bataclans.\u201d He was referring to the Belgian airport and to the Paris concert hall where 90 people were killed by gunmen on Nov. 13.\n\nYet the track record of information gleaned from other terrorists captured in Europe is not necessarily promising.\n\nThe police had under lock and key the gunman who attacked a high-speed train traveling between Brussels and Paris last August. Yet it was of no help in staving off the November attack, even though the operation is thought to have had the same mastermind, Abdelhamid Abaaoud.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd the police have evidently learned little from Mehdi Nemmouche, the taciturn killer who fired on the Jewish Museum in Brussels in 2014 and has hardly talked since, according to Belgian news media.\n\nSimilar disappointments may lie in store for Mr. Abdeslam\u2019s interrogators. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who is very central, yet he pulled back from Paris, and in the case of Brussels he didn\u2019t participate in the execution,\u201d said Thomas Renard, a terrorism expert at the Egmont Institute in Belgium. \u201cHe didn\u2019t go all the way to the end.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Which is what Mr. Abdeslam did.\n\nBelgian authorities are looking into links between Mr. Abdeslam and the brothers who set off the bombs, the Bakraouis. He was hiding out in an apartment that the authorities suspect was rented by one of the brothers in the Brussels neighborhood of Forest when the police raided it on March 15.\n\nA possible second bomber at the airport on Tuesday, Najim Laachraoui, is suspected of having made the suicide belts used in the Paris attacks, in which Mr. Abdeslam played a central logistics role, the authorities say.\n\nMr. Abdeslam bought materials used to make the suicide belts, rented several cars, including the one used by the terrorists who opened fire at the Bataclan music hall and helped rent an apartment used by the Nov. 13 plotters, the authorities say.\n\nHe \u201cparticipated in the arrival of a certain number of terrorists in Europe,\u201d the Paris prosecutor, Fran\u00e7ois Molins, said on Saturday. But then, at the moment of the Paris attacks, Mr. Abdeslam backed down.\n\nIt was not a complete reversal of position. Rather than turning himself in, he fled back across the border to Belgium to rejoin the terrorist cell that had nurtured him.\n\n\u201cHe rejoined his accomplices in Belgium,\u201d said Mr. Poinas, the former counterterrorism official. \u201cSo you cannot count on his sincerity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere are people who have repented,\u201d Mr. Poinas added. \u201cBut he has done nothing, his whole attitude is suspect. This is not the trajectory of someone who has repented. On the 14th of November, he could have turned himself in. Yet one can\u2019t say that he has renounced.\u201d", "summary": "He backed out of the Paris attacks, yet the authorities say he returned immediately to the Brussels terrorist cell that is believed to have been tied to the Islamic State, instead of turning himself in.Asked why Mr. Abdeslam had changed his mind on extradition, Mr. Mary said that his client understood \u201cthe case here is just a small piece,\u201d and that he wanted to \u201cexplain himself in France.\u201dAnd the police have evidently learned little from Mehdi Nemmouche, the taciturn killer who fired on the Jewish Museum in Brussels in 2014 and has hardly talked since, according to Belgian news media.\u201cHe\u2019s someone who is very central, yet he pulled back from Paris, and in the case of Brussels he didn\u2019t participate in the execution,\u201d said Thomas Renard, a terrorism expert at the Egmont Institute in Belgium.A possible second bomber at the airport on Tuesday, Najim Laachraoui, is suspected of having made the suicide belts used in the Paris attacks, in which Mr. Abdeslam played a central logistics role, the authorities say."}
