In addition to Mr. Abdeslam, those still at large include Mohamed Abrini, who appears in video footage with some of the attackers as they travel to France.\n\nSo far, the Belgian authorities have arrested nine people who have been charged with crimes relating to the November attacks in Paris. But little has been clarified about what role they may have played.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor also confirmed Wednesday that the police had found that two hours before the attacks began, one of the cars used by the assailants had traveled to the city\u2019s largest international airport, Charles de Gaulle.\n\nIt stayed for about an hour at Terminal 2C. One of the attackers contacted the phone of someone in the car. It is not clear if someone was dropped off, picked up or neither.\n\nUp until now, investigators have said Mr. Abaaoud, a 28-year-old Belgian, was believed to have been the chief planner of the coordinated assaults. He was among three people killed five days later in a raid by the French police in a Paris suburb.\n\nBut the new information on the cellphone connections appears to have undercut that assumption. No one knows the identity of the person contacted in Belgium, nor the person\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The group, also known as ISIS and ISIL, claimed responsibility for the attacks less than 24 hours after they were carried out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe attacks must have been decided by someone at the top of ISIS, very likely someone close to Baghdadi, and probably an Iraqi from Saddam Hussein\u2019s intelligence or military,\u201d Mr. Moniquet added.\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s ranks include some experienced Iraqi intelligence and military figures who worked for Saddam Hussein and lost their jobs when he was ousted by the United States-led coalition in 2003.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s clear they had to have commanders on the ground,\u201d Mr. Moniquet said. \u201cWe know that Abaaoud was a commander on the ground,\u201d along with Mr. Abdeslam, who appears to have been less senior but still had some authority.\n\nAnother possible commander or liaison to the commanders in Iraq or Syria was Charaffe al-Mouadan, who was killed on Dec. 24 by an American airstrike. He was the subject of a conversation among the Bataclan assailants during the attack.\n\nOne of the survivors said that he had overheard one assailant ask another if they should call Souleymane, the nom de guerre of Mr. Mouadan, and the other replied that he was not going to call him.", "summary": "In addition to Mr. Abdeslam, those still at large include Mohamed Abrini, who appears in video footage with some of the attackers as they travel to France.
