Nearly every other senior figure in the governing Conservative Party was either sidelined or put in political peril by the vote on Europe, leaving a leadership vacuum that she is now filling with support from across the party\u2019s fractious elements. The opposition Labour Party is in disarray and at risk of splitting.\n\nIn her one substantive campaign appearance before the rapid sequence of events on Monday that cleared the way for her to take power, she set out a vision of a Conservative government intent on doing much more than decoupling from Europe and eager to seize the political center. Seeking to address the underlying causes of the vote to leave the union, she suggested that she would address the anxieties and frustrations of the British who feel left behind or imperiled by globalization and its effects, including inequality.\n\n\u201cWithin the Conservative Party some of her obvious foes have either been undermined, or have undermined themselves, so she does have a clear opportunity,\u201d said Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. He also said that the Labour Party was \u201calmost in an existential crisis and those who are talking about it possibly splitting are not too far-off.\u201d\n\nMr. Cowley said that Ms. May faced formidable challenges, but added that there was a golden rule of sorts in British politics: \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate Theresa May.\u201d\n\nHer transition moved ahead rapidly on Tuesday. Prime Minister David Cameron chaired his 215th and final cabinet meeting, planned to go to Queen Elizabeth II with his resignation after a final appearance before Parliament on Wednesday and was already preparing to move out of 10 Downing Street to make room for Ms. May.\n\nShe will take office on Wednesday, though little known internationally and having never held an economic or foreign policy position in government.\n\nHow she will approach the new job is only starting to emerge because, despite her years in the cabinet, she has done one job, home secretary, which put her in charge of the Home Office dealing with issues like security, policing and immigration. In a speech on Monday in Birmingham, England, Ms. May outlined some wider ambitions, positioning her to the left of many of her colleagues on economic issues, calling for new mechanisms to curb executive pay and warning big multinational companies that they must pay their share of taxes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough Ms. May has sometimes been compared to Britain\u2019s previous female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, Ms. May\u2019s centrist-like speech in Birmingham provoked comparisons to the agenda of the former Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband. One former Labour adviser, Tom Baldwin, posted on Twitter: \u201cTory PM-elect steals Ed Miliband\u2019s slogan.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Among those at greatest risk is the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who was once a rival and the leading contender to succeed Mr. Cameron but whose prospects were wrecked by his aggressive campaigning for Britain to remain in the union.\n\nMs. May\u2019s speech on Monday hinted that Mr. Osborne had presided over an economy that contributed to a referendum result that many see as the consequence of a broader malaise in Britain. \u201cThere is a gaping chasm between wealthy London and the rest of the country,\u201d she said in the speech.\n\nThe daughter of a clergyman, Ms. May was regarded as a modernizer in the Conservative Party before taking over at the Home Office. In 2002, she told Conservative Party activists that they risked being known as members of the \u201cnasty party.\u201d\n\nYet the issue of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union will almost inevitably define Ms. May, too, because her primary task is to negotiate a new relationship with the bloc. She has made clear that the outcome of the referendum is the final word on Britain\u2019s membership in the union, but she appears intent on moving cautiously. That is, in part, because she sided with those who wanted to remain, so her every move will be watched closely by those in her party who championed leaving.\n\nOne important issue is when the government will begin negotiating formally with Europe by invoking Article 50 of the union\u2019s Lisbon Treaty, which effectively gives a two-year deadline for a deal on withdrawal to be reached.\n\nMs. May does not plan to depart the union quickly because it could put Britain\u2019s negotiators under pressure, and at a disadvantage.\n\nSome Brexit supporters want to move fast to lock in the referendum result. Nigel Farage, who recently announced his resignation as leader of the pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, said in a statement that \u201cto hold faith with over 17 million voters who opted for Leave, she must trigger Article 50 at the earliest realistic opportunity,\u201d adding that \u201cUKIP will be watching like a hawk to ensure that there is no backsliding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne challenge for Ms. May is that the country did not vote on a specific plan to replace Britain\u2019s current relationship with Europe.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that nobody knows what Brexit means,\u201d said Professor Cowley. \u201cAlmost anything she can deliver is going to disappoint somebody \u2014 perhaps by being insufficiently restrictive on immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of those who voted for Brexit expecting big cuts in immigration \u2014 or even repatriation \u2014 are going to be disappointed,\u201d he added.\n\nTalks on the exit are most likely to come down to a trade-off between the amount of access Britain wants to Europe\u2019s single market of goods and services and the extent to which it curbs the free movement of workers that this entails. While big business will press for access to the single market, Ms. May will be under pressure from Brexit supporters to deliver cuts in immigration.\n\nAnd the longer Britain drifts, the greater the uncertainty for businesses that could postpone investment decisions until things are clearer, potentially pushing the nation into a recession.\n\nThe financial markets have been encouraged by Ms. May\u2019s appointment, but they are not celebrating yet.\n\n\u201cThe speed at which the Conservative Party has rallied around May is heartening and promises greater clarity around upcoming negotiations. This is probably the most important political development, and a positive one,\u201d wrote Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC global asset management.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, tangential Brexit risks have become more dangerous,\u201d he added, citing Britain\u2019s commercial real estate market where there are fears that foreigners will relocate their businesses and homes abroad.\n\nDelivering Brexit will therefore be Ms. May\u2019s defining task and, as Mr. Cowley puts it, this will hardly be easy. \u201cIf the pessimistic scenario for Brexit comes true, she is going to be delivering all this against the background of economic difficulty,\u201d he added.", "summary": "In her one substantive campaign appearance before the rapid sequence of events on Monday that cleared the way for her to take power, she set out a vision of a Conservative government intent on doing much more than decoupling from Europe and eager to seize the political center.
