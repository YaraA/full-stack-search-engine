{"title": "Aleksei Navalny, Viable Putin Rival, Is Barred From a Presidential Run", "authors": ["Neil Macfarquhar", "Ivan Nechepurenko"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/world/europe/russia-aleksei-navalny-putin.html", "body": "Russian television is largely back under government control, as it was during Soviet times, along with most formerly independent news agencies. More than 100 nongovernmental organizations working on issues including the environment, civic education and fighting the spread of AIDS have been declared \u201cforeign agents,\u201d forcing many to close.\n\nMr. Navalny was the driving force behind large street protests in 2011, 2012 and 2013 that unnerved Mr. Putin. He has also repeatedly embarrassed senior officials by accusing them of corruption, exposing their lavish mansions and other perquisites that seem beyond the reach of a public servant earning a modest government salary.\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Navalny became the prime example of how the government would use the courts to entangle critics. In addition to the conviction revived on Wednesday, he has been accused of defrauding a French perfume company and stealing a nearly worthless piece of street art, and he was caught up in yet another case involving the death of an elk.\n\nWhile he spent much of 2014 under house arrest, his younger brother Oleg was sent to jail for three and a half years.\n\nMr. Navalny, who called the Kirov fraud charges baseless and politically motivated, responded to the latest judgment against him with defiance. \u201cPutin and his gang of thieves are afraid to face us in elections,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cRightly so: We will win.\u201d\n\nIn a longer statement, he vowed to continue his presidential run. \u201cWe do not recognize this verdict. It will be overturned,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to the Constitution, I have a full right to take part in elections, and I will do this. I will continue to represent the interests of people who want to see Russia as a normal, honest, uncorrupt country.\u201d\n\nThe Kirov court\u2019s ruling followed almost verbatim the judgment issued against Mr. Navalny in the same case in 2013, which resulted in a five-year suspended sentence. That verdict was overturned by the European Court of Human Rights, and Russia\u2019s Supreme Court ordered a new trial in December.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the retrial was organized unusually quickly for Russia, Mr. Navalny announced that he was running for president before his latest conviction.\n\nRussian political analysts suggested that the prospect of Mr. Navalny\u2019s gaining a national platform to further criticize Mr. Putin had proved too much for the Kremlin hierarchy to tolerate.\n\n\u201cThe danger associated with Mr. Navalny is easy to explain,\u201d Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email. \u201cIf allowed to run, he will disseminate his corruption findings more widely than ever \u2014 and this disturbs very much Mr. Putin and his gang.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He garnered 27.2 percent of the vote, just short of the threshold needed to force the government-backed candidate into a runoff \u2014 and enough to feed the Kremlin\u2019s fears.\n\nMr. Navalny\u2019s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, announced that he would appeal the verdict and file complaints with Russia\u2019s Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe European Union issued a statement criticizing the latest verdict, noting that its human rights court had already found that Mr. Navalny did not get a fair trial in 2013.\n\n\u201cThis latest decision, which effectively excludes Mr. Navalny from the political arena, further constrains political pluralism in Russia and raises serious questions as to the fairness of democratic processes in Russia,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Navalny and his team pointed out that there was a conflict between the electoral law and the Constitution, which does not list a criminal conviction among the specific reasons to bar a candidate.\n\nLegal analysts said that, just as in the fraud case, any rulings in the other cases against Mr. Navalny would undoubtedly favor the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cYou can complain about this, but the result will be clear,\u201d said Andrei Y. Buzin, an expert at Golos, an independent election monitor. \u201cThe Constitutional Court will say that lawmakers have the right to impose the restrictions it deems necessary to protect the freedoms of other citizens.\u201d\n\nIn the Kirov case, the court convicted Mr. Navalny of embezzling 16 million rubles, worth about $500,000 at the time, by purchasing timber from a state-owned company at below-market rates and then reselling it at market value.\n\nThe investigators said Mr. Navalny had used his position at the time as an aide to the Kirov regional governor to persuade the company to sign the contract.\n\nMr. Navalny said the timber was bought at market rates.\n\nAs the judge, Aleksei Vtyurin, droned through the familiar decision in a barely audible monotone, reading from nearly the same verdict as four years ago, Mr. Navalny took to Twitter to mock the proceedings.\n\n\u201cThis is page 40 now, and there are 77 of them. It\u2019s comfortable to have the verdict in hand,\u201d Mr. Navalny said from the courtroom.\n\nEven before the verdict was announced, the government moved to shut down the logistics for his presidential run. On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s leading information technology company, Yandex, unplugged the online account that Mr. Navalny had used to collect money from supporters."}
