The victims were three 14-year-olds, two 15-year-olds, and individuals ages 17, 19, 20 and 45.\n\nThe shooting occurred at the Olympia mall, in a neighborhood to the west of downtown Munich. The count of those injured rose to 35, including several who had been injured elsewhere in the city in the panic that followed the attack, officials said.\n\nEmergency calls to police had led them to believe there could be as many as three gunmen. With the rampage coming on the heels of the attacks by a Tunisian immigrant who killed 84 people in Nice, France, and by a young Afghan refugee wielding an ax and a knife who wounded five people on a train in Germany, fear spread quickly.\n\nAnd late Sunday, at least one man was killed and 10 people injured after an explosion near a music festival in Ansbach, Germany, according to German officials.\n\nThomas Steinkraus-Koch, the spokesman for the Munich prosecutors\u2019 office, said initial evidence had not indicated any kind of political motivation for Mr. Sonboly\u2019s attack.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Five of the victims were found inside the restaurant, two others on the sidewalk in front, one in front of an electronics market and one inside the mall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNone of the victims were schoolmates of the gunman or appeared to have responded to the invitation over social media. \u201cNone of those named in the commentary under the posting were among the victims,\u201d Chief Heimberger said.\n\nSome reports identified the gunman as David Ali Sonboly, but neighbors in his apartment building said everyone had known him as Ali. His parents remained too distraught to question, Chief Heimberger said.\n\nChief Heimberger stressed that officials had only begun their investigation, but that evidence collected so far painted a picture of a mentally disturbed teenager obsessed with mass shootings and first-person-shooter video games, including Counter-Strike: Source.\n\nMedical records showed that the gunman had received inpatient psychiatric treatment for two months in 2015 and continued to be seen as an outpatient, Mr. Steinkraus-Koch said. Prescription medication for treatment of depression was found in Mr. Sonboly\u2019s home, Mr. Steinkraus-Koch said, but it was not clear if he had been taking the medication regularly.\n\nAfter a brief altercation with the police, the gunman fired a bullet into his head, Mr. Steinkraus-Koch said. The pistol, a Glock 17, was a former theater weapon that had been restored to be capable of shooting live rounds.\n\nPressed for further details about the weapon and the gunman\u2019s activities on the internet, Chief Heimberger said he knew little about the murky world of the darknet, which is accessible only by certain software and is used by criminals and terrorists to communicate without being detected.", "summary": "And late Sunday, at least one man was killed and 10 people injured after an explosion near a music festival in Ansbach, Germany, according to German officials.
