{"title": "European Union Asks Member Countries to Accept Quotas of Migrants", "authors": ["James Kanter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/world/europe/european-union-asks-member-countries-to-accept-quotas-of-migrants.html", "body": "But by moving forward a proposal that is already unpopular in many countries, the commission has exacerbated tensions over the broader issue of immigration in the European Union. A large number of member states, including Britain, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Latvia, have already pushed back against the idea of mandatory quotas. And a mandatory quota would require a vote by a two-thirds majority of member states under the European Union\u2019s weighted voting system to take effect.\n\nAsylum seekers are often unwelcome in countries where there is little experience of accepting newcomers from Africa and the Middle East, as in the Baltics, or where the population already believes that the country is overcrowded, as in Britain. Some countries have also criticized Italy and Greece for what they see as failing to identify migrants who do not qualify for asylum.\n\nIn an effort to make the plan more acceptable, the commission said any migrants who did not meet asylum criteria would not be allowed to stay.\n\n\u201cEveryone who needs sanctuary should find it in Europe,\u201d said Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the commission. \u201cBut those who have no justified claim should be quickly identified and returned to their home country.\u201d\n\nThe first quota is an emergency plan to temporarily relocate 40,000 migrants arriving in Italy and Greece to other states during the next two years under a mandatory system. Those migrants, expected to be from Syria and Eritrea, would remain in Europe while they underwent asylum review to determine whether they could stay.\n\nA second quota plan would resettle 20,000 refugees \u2014 these could include Syrians from camps in Lebanon and Turkey \u2014 over two years across Europe. Candidates for the resettlement program would be identified by the United Nations refugee authorities. Participation in that system is expected to be voluntary for European Union countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder a distribution system based on the capacity of countries to accept migrants, France and Germany would take the most people under both of the quota systems.\n\nBritain and Ireland can choose not to participate in the mandatory quota system under existing agreements with the European Union. But others, including the Czech Republic and other East and Central European countries, would need to mount sufficient opposition to block approval. Denmark is exempt from most European Union asylum rules.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

The country has become ungovernable since Western powers backed a revolt that ousted Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi four years ago.\n\nThis month, European foreign and defense ministers agreed to use military force to disable or sink smugglers\u2019 vessels to break up their business networks. But European officials still need to answer numerous questions about how naval forces would operate in Libyan waters \u2014 including whether those forces would take migrants rescued near African shores back to Libya or to Europe for asylum review.", "summary": "But by moving forward a proposal that is already unpopular in many countries, the commission has exacerbated tensions over the broader issue of immigration in the European Union.A large number of member states, including Britain, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Latvia, have already pushed back against the idea of mandatory quotas.\u201cCountries like Germany and Sweden have enormous moral authority here,\u201d Ms. Collett said, \u201cbecause they are not only ready to do more themselves to take in asylum seekers, at least temporarily, but they are firmly in favor of the rest of the European Union doing their part, too.\u201dThe quotas are just part of the response that Europeans have considered to deal with a migrant crisis that has been made more acute by the instability in Libya, a frequent beginning point for smugglers.This month, European foreign and defense ministers agreed to use military force to disable or sink smugglers\u2019 vessels to break up their business networks."}
