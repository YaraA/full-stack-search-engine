Mr. Gulen has denied the allegations and said that neither he nor his followers had any motive to hurt the government or the army.\n\nIn March, Parliament voted to abolish the special courts in which the officers in the Sledgehammer case and another case related to coup allegations, Ergenekon, were tried. The courts had operated under special rules that allowed secret witnesses and wiretaps that would not have been allowed in ordinary trials.\n\nThe constitutional court said some of the evidence, which dates back to 2003, had been misused; lawyers for the defendants have said it was falsified.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He added that he expected the new trial to begin in January.\n\nThe families of the convicts and demonstrators gathered outside Silivri prison in Istanbul late Thursday, waving Turkish flags and dancing as they waited for the release of the officers. Television footage showed dozens of people who had arrived in a convoy of honking cars to greet more than 40 officers leaving the Mamak military prison in Ankara, the Turkish capital.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe this has come to an end,\u201d said Nil Kutluk, the daughter of a navy admiral who was convicted in the Sledgehammer case, adding, \u201cEverything was about seeking justice for our loved ones; with this decision we are also free.\u201d\n\nReferring to the Erdogan-Gulen split, Ilkay Sezer, a lawyer who represented nine of the coup suspects, said: \u201cI am not interested in any rift between any groups. All I am interested in is that courts ruled in line with universal principles of law.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Erdogan believes that Gulen sympathizers are behind the corruption inquiry, and sees his former ally as the leader of a \u201cparallel state\u201d that is working to overthrow his government.\u201cThe due-process violations in the trial were evident from Day 1,\u201d Dani Rodrik, an economist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and a son-in-law of Cetin Dogan, a former army general said to be the ringleader of the coup plot, said in an email.The families of the convicts and demonstrators gathered outside Silivri prison in Istanbul late Thursday, waving Turkish flags and dancing as they waited for the release of the officers.Television footage showed dozens of people who had arrived in a convoy of honking cars to greet more than 40 officers leaving the Mamak military prison in Ankara, the Turkish capital.\u201cI still can\u2019t believe this has come to an end,\u201d said Nil Kutluk, the daughter of a navy admiral who was convicted in the Sledgehammer case, adding, \u201cEverything was about seeking justice for our loved ones; with this decision we are also free.\u201d"}
