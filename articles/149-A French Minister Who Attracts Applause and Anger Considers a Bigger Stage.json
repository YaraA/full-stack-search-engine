Many of them see him as a capitalist interloper, a traitor to Socialist ideals and a threat to their traditional base among workers.\n\nOn Monday, it was militants from the far-left CGT union who greeted the young minister with eggs \u2014 one landed in his hair \u2014 and catcalls in the Communist-controlled Paris suburb of Montreuil. \u201cGet lost!\u201d they shouted at him.\n\nThe melee followed months of demonstrations in the streets by workers who have blocked oil refineries, nuclear plants, factories and the country\u2019s rail network. The unrest has been set off by a government economic overhaul \u2014 an attempt, bold at first, to loosen France\u2019s ultratight labor laws, making hiring and firing easier and weakening the union\u2019s grip.\n\nAs much as anyone\u2019s, it is Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas that the demonstrators are protesting. In addition, his banking background, elite education, button-down persona and technocratic aura \u2014 he angrily told a T-shirted demonstrator several weeks ago that \u201cthe best way to afford a suit is to work\u201d \u2014 have made him the focus of much of the rage. (\u201cI\u2019ve been working since the age of 16, sir!\u201d the demonstrator responded.)\n\nFrance appears both terrified and absorbed by Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas \u2014 making it easier to get and lose a job, to move to a new job, and to shake off the lifetime security of unbreakable contracts in search of something better.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a desire for change, but a fear of change, too. That\u2019s France,\u201d said Philippe Aghion, a Harvard economist who worked with Mr. Macron on a reform commission in 2008, and has influenced him.\n\nThe ideas generated by that commission weigh in the minister\u2019s thinking, Mr. Aghion said.\n\nThe T-shirt incident was captured on video and quickly went viral, earning Mr. Macron a mocking hashtag, #UnTshirtpourMacron, and much derision in the news media.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Macron polls far higher than his boss, Mr. Hollande, whose re-election prospects next year look increasingly shaky. Mr. Macron is the darling of the businessmen\u2019s confederation and the favorite of right-leaning pro-capitalism media in France, and he earned applause and rage in equal measure when he said in an interview last year, \u201cWe need young Frenchmen who want to become billionaires.\u201d\n\nIn a recent visit to the northern industrial town of Valenciennes, Mr. Macron appeared to be in full campaign mode.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

He quizzed them attentively, like a candidate, about their hopes and aspirations.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake for me is to inspire confidence again,\u201d Mr. Macron, striking a broad theme for France\u2019s future, told a worker grumbling about the labor reform law at a mattress factory. Nearby, other workers waited patiently for pictures.\n\nTo the Socialist establishment, Mr. Macron is too ready to lecture much older politicians, and is the man who wants to \u201creintroduce mobility in the labor market,\u201d as he wrote in an article last year, but also to end \u201cour culture of paying managers more.\u201d\n\nIn his characteristic rapid-fire delivery, he told a parliamentary committee last month: \u201cWe\u2019ve created rigidities at the entrance point in artisanal occupations,\u201d like hairdressers and nail salons. \u201cWe\u2019ve put up barriers.\u201d France needs to \u201chelp in the creation of jobs for which qualifications are limited,\u201d he said. He was one of the youngest men in the room.\n\nAn older Communist representative would have none of it.\n\n\u201cThere is always with you this, I won\u2019t say, obsession to liberate activity,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Chassaigne, a factory worker\u2019s son, scolded Mr. Macron. \u201cAs a society, we would lose our bearings.\u201d\n\nThe French news media seemingly can\u2019t get enough of Mr. Macron. Intrigued by his combination of brains (he once served as an assistant to one of France\u2019s leading 20th-century philosophers, Paul Ricoeur) and heterodoxy, they have put him on the cover of newsmagazines more in the last six months than any other political figure, despite his thin record of accomplishment so far.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Macron Rocket \u2014 His Secret Plan for 2017\u201d was one recent cover; \u201cMacron: Why Not Him? How He Wants to Break the System\u201d was another. Even glossy gossip magazines like Paris Match follow him, drawn by his unusual domestic arrangements: He is married to his high school teacher, 20 years his senior, from Amiens.\n\nIn the central city of Orl\u00e9ans last month, he was invited by an opposition party mayor to preside over ceremonies honoring Joan of Arc, who made her decisive stand against the English there in 1429.\n\n\u201cJeanne was a shepherdess, but she beat a path to the king,\u201d Mr. Macron told hundreds spread out in the plaza in front of the towering 17th-century cathedral in the city where she led the French troops in battle.\n\n\u201cJeanne was a nobody. But she carried on her shoulders the will to progress and justice of an entire people. She was a crazy dream. But she wound up imposing herself as something obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve in individual initiatives, in courage, in risk.\u201d\n\nThe applause for Mr. Macron was polite \u2014 his highfalutin style, nurtured at France\u2019s best schools like the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration, is peppered with references to the country\u2019s literary and political heroes.\n\nBut the audience was attentive, even if his arrival was greeted with boos from union members.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a crazy dream, impossible,\u201d he recently told a crowd in Lyon, \u201cbut this great change, necessary to our country, I\u2019m persuaded we can accomplish it together.\u201d\n\nThe City Hall in Lyon was packed, and the mayor there greeted him like a hero.\n\nMr. Aghion, the Harvard economist, said: \u201cHe\u2019s a free atom. One doesn\u2019t really know where he is going.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is,\u201d Mr. Aghion added, \u201che doesn\u2019t really have any allies.\u201d\n\nMuch of the challenge Mr. Macron will face, if he enters the lists in next year\u2019s race, was summed up in an encounter with reporters in Valenciennes. Defending himself over the harsh T-shirt encounter, he said, \u201cOne doesn\u2019t tutoie a minister,\u201d referring to the familiar form of the second-person pronoun.\n\nTrue, the \u201ctu\u201d form is generally used only with children and friends, and not with ministers. But a politician with national ambitions in France might be better off not pointing that out to a gaggle of journalists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to separate himself from his image as a technocrat,\u201d Mr. Aghion said."}
