Predicting that the National Front would win a plurality of the votes for the European Parliament among French parties, she promised to work with far-right parties from other countries to create a \u201ccrisis\u201d in the Parliament with the goal of destabilizing the institutions of the European Union.\n\nHowever, she specifically distanced herself from the violent Golden Dawn party in Greece and from the Hungarian Jobbik party, which has made explicit anti-Semitic statements. In a further bid to soften her party\u2019s image in France, she said she did not agree with the leader of the Dutch far-right party, Geert Wilders, that Europe and Islam are incompatible.\n\nDespite the National Front\u2019s success in 2012, it is unclear whether it will be able to recruit enough attractive candidates for this year\u2019s municipal elections to meet its ambitions. It has never been a grass-roots movement, instead being powered by the personality of its leadership.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, almost any gain in local seats could be interpreted as a success for Ms. Le Pen. The National Front now has just two members in the National Assembly and fewer than 200 municipal council members out of tens of thousands across France. It has no mayoralties in any sizable city.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But the party will compete in five times as many municipal races as it did in 2008, the last time they were held, she said, which means it will have candidates in about 500 of the 3,000 larger municipalities across the country.\n\nOn Thursday she again called for France to retreat from its current position in the European Union, re-establish the franc as its currency, and drastically slow immigration and cut social benefits for legal and illegal immigrants.\n\nMs. Le Pen\u2019s focus remains on immigration, which she held up as \u201cthe problem of the 21st century,\u201d saying that immigrants cost France as much as $70 billion a year. She did not explain how that number was calculated.\n\nShe was particularly critical of the policy of extending subsidies to immigrants that are intended to encourage larger French families. Giving them to immigrants, she said, defeats the purpose of the subsidies.\n\nFrance is thought to have more than five million legal immigrants, many from other European Union countries whose citizens are free to cross borders to work here. It also has large numbers of legal migrants from former French colonies in Africa, as well as an estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants.\n\nMs. Le Pen\u2019s hostility to Europe is rooted in her belief that the European Union has neutered the sovereignty of member states and muzzled the French people\u2019s say in policy decisions. \u201cThe reality is that the French people and European peoples are no longer sovereign,\u201d she said. She called for a Europe of \u201cfree nations.\u201d\n\nOf Europe she said, \u201cI am just waiting for one thing, which is that it break into pieces.\u201d\n\nShe allowed that there could be cooperation among European countries, but that there should be no rules that trump national laws. When it comes to the marketplace, she would call for protectionism, requiring a \u201cnational preference\u201d for French companies for public contracts and French citizens for jobs."}
