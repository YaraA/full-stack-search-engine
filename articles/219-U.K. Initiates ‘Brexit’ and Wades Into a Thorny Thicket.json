Nevertheless, he said, \u201cI still think they are readier to walk out than most people accept.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nGiven her negotiating \u201cred lines,\u201d the difference between whatever deal Mrs. May can secure and no deal at all may turn out to be relatively small. Blaming the Europeans for a collapse of the talks might be easier, politically, than bringing a weak agreement to Parliament.\n\nThe politics are so toxic, Professor Menon added, that they make a disorderly departure from the bloc \u2014 often likened to walking off a cliff edge \u2014 plausible. \u201cIt\u2019s ugly and so frighteningly horrible, that I can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s happening,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEuropean leaders have emphasized that Britain cannot \u201ccherry pick\u201d the rules and regulations it likes, and certainly cannot expect to have a better deal than countries that remain in the bloc. The last thing they want to do is lend greater momentum to the centrifugal forces already threatening to tear apart the European Union.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Tusk said at a news conference in Brussels that there was \u201cno reason to pretend this is a happy day,\u201d and that Britain\u2019s plans to depart the bloc would only leave the 27 remaining members \u201cmore determined and more united.\u201d He added, \u201cWe already miss you.\u201d\n\nManfred Weber, a German lawmaker and a powerful conservative in the European Parliament, wrote on Twitter that \u201cfrom now on, only the interests of the remaining 440 million Europeans count for us.\u201d He later added, \u201cIf you leave the EU, you lose the associated benefits.\u201d\n\nWhat makes the looming confrontation so dangerous is that both sides stand to lose economically in the event of a breakdown.\n\nFrom agriculture to aviation, from fisheries to pharmaceuticals, Britain\u2019s economy has been shaped by membership in the European Union, its main trading partner. With its single market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 and its customs union, the European Union ensures customs-free trade across frontiers in goods and some services.\n\nWithout a deal, Britain faces customs checks at its borders and tariffs on imports and exports, not to mention the relocation of at least part of its lucrative financial services sector.\n\nBut Britain is a big market for Continental Europe, too: Germany alone exports 800,000 vehicles there every year. Though London\u2019s dominant financial services sector is hardly popular, many businesses on the Continent rely on its deep capital markets.\n\nBritain is one of only two significant military powers in the bloc \u2014 the other is France \u2014 and has valuable security and intelligence capabilities that elevate Europe on the global stage.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn her letter to Mr. Tusk, Mrs. May argued that without an overall agreement, \u201cour cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened.\u201d Her officials later denied that this was a threat by Britain, arguing that it reflected the fact that some cooperation on policing issues was conducted through European Union channels.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u2019s negotiator for Britain\u2019s exit, said there could be no \u201ctrade-off\u201d in talks between such issues and trade. \u201cI think that the security of our citizens is far too important,\u201d Mr. Verhofstadt said.\n\nTo make matters more difficult, the final deal will require votes in perhaps 38 legislatures across Europe, as well as in the British Parliament.\n\nIt is even possible that the negotiations could founder over the issue of money before they really get underway. Michel Barnier, the negotiator appointed by the European Commission, wants to resolve the terms of the departure before moving on to future trade ties.\n\nThe commission estimates that Britain owes as much as $64 billion in future spending commitments and pension entitlements for European Union officials. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has rejected that idea, invoking the memory of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who in 1984 demanded \u2014 and received \u2014 her \u201cmoney back\u201d from European partners in another acrimonious negotiation.\n\nPhoto\n\nDiplomats say a collapse over money matters can be avoided if specifics are left until the end of the talks, when the parameters of a trade deal are known. European officials seem open to that idea of reaching agreement on the principles and methodology of calculating what Britain owes, based on commitments undertaken while it was a member. That would allow Mrs. May to justify payments as part of a deal allowing continued access to European markets.\n\nJoachim Fritz-Vannahme, director of the Europe program at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a research institute based in Germany, said the best prospect of achieving agreement was a broad discussion, including defense and security cooperation, an area where London has something to offer at a time when NATO\u2019s role is being questioned.\n\n\u201cIf you go narrow, it is tremendously difficult,\u201d Mr. Fritz-Vannahme added. \u201cIt will not bring the problem to a conclusion in two years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe said he believed one danger was the \u201cillusion\u201d among some in Brussels that the European Union was \u201cstrong enough to live without the Brits,\u201d who still have significant economic and military power. Another is the illusion among some Britons that they can dictate the terms of a deal.\n\nProfessor Menon, too, said he thought the messages from some British politicians, reinforced by tabloid newspapers aggressively for the exit, were destructive. \u201cThe British people now think that Europeans will be stupid if they don\u2019t give us a good deal, because it\u2019s in their own interest,\u201d he said.\n\nTime will be a problem, too. British businesses want a transition period to adapt to the circumstances after withdrawal, but this requires an agreement on what Britain would transition to after 2019. And unless all this is decided quickly, it will be of little use; companies will not be able to wait long into 2018 before assuming the worst outcome and acting accordingly, even if that means a sharp economic adjustment.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens, she is not going to have a great deal,\u201d Professor Menon said, referring to Mrs. May. \u201cIt is still going to involve a lot of pain, given that we are outside the customs union and the single market.\u201d"}
