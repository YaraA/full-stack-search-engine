Cities still have to find housing that suits extended families so they can mix with the existing population, and avoid creating ghettos.\n\nMICHAEL KIMMELMAN\n\nQ. What are the reasons for Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to welcome refugees? How much is humanitarian, how much a need for younger people (taxpayers), how much a desire for labor \u2014 cheap and otherwise? How much is prestige, how much World War II guilt? \u2014 Isa Mara Lando, Rio de Janeiro\n\nA. You have correctly identified the various motives; all of them likely play a part in Ms. Merkel\u2019s decisions. In addition, I would note aspects of her biography: Ms. Merkel is the daughter of a Lutheran minister and she grew up in communist East Germany.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe tone of her remarks since Germany received thousands of asylum seekers trapped in Hungary in early September has reflected a particular German obligation to offer asylum to those in danger that was not offered to Jews and other victims of the Nazis. But Ms. Merkel\u2019s words also reflect a concern and sympathy for her fellow humans that was surely part of her upbringing. ALISON SMALE\n\nQ. Are all the refugees arriving in Europe illegally, dealing with smugglers using unsafe boats? Is there no legal, safe way for them to reach Europe?

It also tends to weed out people who do not have a legitimate case for asylum; migrants who are seeking better economic opportunities usually prefer to take their chances and pay smugglers to get them to Europe before applying.\n\nSome of these migrants might believe that once they are in a country, it will be very difficult for that country to get them to leave if they are not granted asylum. Lots of people are rejected, but few are deported. And the process can take years.\n\nCountries that are party to the United Nations convention are obliged to examine the asylum claim of anyone who shows up at their border asking for refuge, but they are not obliged to provide safe passage to that border. It is up to the refugee to get to wherever he or she wants to go.
