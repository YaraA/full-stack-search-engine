He and an accomplice, Anis Bahri, 32, are believed to have visited Syria between late 2014 and early 2015, Mr. Molins said. After returning to Europe, he said, they traveled back and forth among France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nOn July 29, a Belgian court convicted Mr. Kriket in absentia of financing a jihadist recruitment network with proceeds from robberies and other crimes. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, believed to have been the chief on-the-ground planner of the Paris attacks, was named in the same proceeding.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Molins said that investigators had not uncovered a specific target or date for the planned attack and were trying to identify other accomplices. Under questioning, he said, Mr. Kriket denied being a terrorist, said he had rented the Argenteuil apartment on behalf of someone whom he would not name, and said the unidentified man and an accomplice were the bomb makers.\n\nThree men have been held in other countries on suspicion of working with Mr. Kriket. One is Mr. Bahri, whom the Dutch police arrested in the port city of Rotterdam on Sunday at the request of the French authorities. The other two are Algerians who were arrested in Brussels on Friday: Abderahmane Ameroud, 38, and a man identified only as Rabah M., 34. (He was previously identified as Rabah N. and Salah A.)\n\nMr. Ameroud had been convicted of providing logistical support to two Tunisian suicide bombers who assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, an Afghan opposition leader, two days before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. In 2005, Mr. Ameroud was found guilty of complicity in the murder.\n\nMr. Ameroud was also linked to an Afghan and Pakistani network suspected of training would-be jihadists in a forest near Paris and in the French Alps. He was convicted of participation in a terrorist enterprise in 2007 and was thought to have been deported to Algeria after serving his sentence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Wednesday, a court in Brussels delayed proceedings against him and Rabah M. to April 7, at the request of their lawyers.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, a government official said that a file with the floor plan and photographs of the office of the Belgian prime minister had been found on a laptop computer discarded in a garbage can last week by one of the terrorists linked to the Brussels attacks. It was found during a raid in the Schaerbeek neighborhood hours after the attacks.\n\nSeveral Belgian newspapers, including L\u2019Echo, De Tijd and De Morgen, reported that the information about the prime minister\u2019s office, the site of regular meetings of cabinet ministers, had been found on the laptop.\n\nOn the same computer, investigators found a statement, described by the authorities as a will, by Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, one of three suicide bombers in the attacks. In that statement, Mr. Bakraoui described himself as increasingly desperate and fearful of ending up in prison.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

The attacks killed 32 people, a lower toll than previously reported, having been revised downward on Tuesday as the authorities finished identifying victims.\n\nOfficials are seeking a third airport attacker and, according to Belgian reports, another person involved in the subway blast.\n\nLocal news reports said the discarded computer also contained precise information about the prime minister\u2019s residence on the Rue de la Loi, steps from the United States Embassy. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Prime Minister Charles Michel at the residence on Friday.\n\nEuropean nations have come under increasing scrutiny for their response to terrorism. On Wednesday, President Obama\u2019s top counterterrorism adviser, Lisa O. Monaco, criticized allies, including France and Belgium, for failing to reduce barriers to the sharing of intelligence among agencies, as the United States did after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Monaco\u2019s remarks, at a security conference at the University of Texas at Austin, were one of the Obama administration\u2019s sternest rebukes of its European partners since the Paris and Brussels attacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that they have not had the same reaction that we did after we had 9/11,\u201d which was \u201cto share information amongst ourselves and to get into a position to share it very rapidly with our international partners,\u201d Ms. Monaco said.\n\nHours before Ms. Monaco spoke, Ard van der Steur, the Dutch minister for security and justice, said it had been the intelligence division of the New York Police Department, not the F.B.I., that warned the Netherlands on March 16 that the Bakraoui brothers had links to terrorism.\n\nMr. van der Steur had previously testified before Dutch lawmakers that the warning came from the F.B.I., but in a statement on Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. It was not clear how the police in New York had become aware of the brothers.\n\nThe Turkish government arrested Ibrahim el-Bakraoui near the Turkish border with Syria in June. Officials there alerted the Belgian government and then deported Mr. Bakraoui to the Netherlands at his request.", "summary": "Mr. Ameroud had been convicted of providing logistical support to two Tunisian suicide bombers who assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, an Afghan opposition leader, two days before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.Also on Wednesday, a government official said that a file with the floor plan and photographs of the office of the Belgian prime minister had been found on a laptop computer discarded in a garbage can last week by one of the terrorists linked to the Brussels attacks.Local news reports said the discarded computer also contained precise information about the prime minister\u2019s residence on the Rue de la Loi, steps from the United States Embassy.On Wednesday, President Obama\u2019s top counterterrorism adviser, Lisa O.
