In a video released after his death, Mr. Coulibaly said he was a supporter of the Islamic State, a rival of Al Qaeda\u2019s.\n\nA member of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, said the joint timing of the two operations was a result of the friendship between Mr. Coulibaly and the Kouachi brothers, not of common planning between the Qaeda group and the Islamic State.\n\nThe attacks appear to illustrate what analysts have described as an evolution in Qaeda tactics and logistics. Because of heightened surveillance, operatives are trained and assigned general targets, but details on how to carry out the operation are no longer micromanaged by the organization. The looser command structure reduces communication, and thus reduces the chance of intercepts by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn repeated statements before they were killed by the police, the Kouachi brothers said they had carried out the attack on behalf of the Qaeda branch in Yemen, saying it was in part to avenge the death of Mr. Awlaki. Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi told French television before his death that Mr. Awlaki had given him financial assistance.\n\nMore on the Paris Shootings\n\nThe Qaeda statement indicated that the attack on Charlie Hebdo was in response to the publication\u2019s frequent caricatures lampooning the Prophet Muhammad. It said that \u201cthe one who chose the target, laid the plan and financed the operation is the leadership of the organization.\u201d But the statement did not identify which leaders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe statement and the video both said that Mr. Awlaki had made the \u201carrangement\u201d with those who carried out the attack in Paris. It said that Mr. Awlaki, who joined the Qaeda branch in Yemen before being killed by an American drone strike in September 2011, \u201cthreatens the West both in his life and after his martyrdom,\u201d a reference to the continuing influence on the Internet of his calls for violent jihad.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the United States said that it had determined the video clip claiming responsibility was genuine, but had not reached a conclusion \u201con whether or not the claims being made in the video are valid.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

American officials were skeptical that Mr. Zawahri had personally ordered the attack.\n\nThere was no explanation of why the group had waited a week to claim responsibility for an attack that terrorized and galvanized all of France and much of the world. But scholars studying the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda said the time that had elapsed between the carnage in Paris a week ago and the claim of responsibility on Wednesday was quick in terms of the normal turnaround after previous attacks, since communication is believed to be via couriers. \u201cIssuing a claim of responsibility for an operation is not something that is done lightly or spur of the moment,\u201d said J. M. Berger, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cBut the big question that investigators need to look at is: How much of a role did AQAP play in the actual planning in the final stages of this process?\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cThey could have given these guys money and training three or four years ago, but when they executed it, it could have been done with money\u201d from other sources.", "summary": "\u201cI suspect that Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi did engage AQAP members in Yemen, but that he was not fully brought into the organization,\u201d said Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism researcher at the New America Foundation in Washington.In repeated statements before they were killed by the police, the Kouachi brothers said they had carried out the attack on behalf of the Qaeda branch in Yemen, saying it was in part to avenge the death of Mr. Awlaki.It said that Mr. Awlaki, who joined the Qaeda branch in Yemen before being killed by an American drone strike in September 2011, \u201cthreatens the West both in his life and after his martyrdom,\u201d a reference to the continuing influence on the Internet of his calls for violent jihad.The Qaeda statement also claimed the attack had been ordered by the group\u2019s overall leader in Pakistan, Ayman al-Zawahri, in keeping with the wishes of his predecessor, Osama bin Laden.But scholars studying the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda said the time that had elapsed between the carnage in Paris a week ago and the claim of responsibility on Wednesday was quick in terms of the normal turnaround after previous attacks, since communication is believed to be via couriers."}
