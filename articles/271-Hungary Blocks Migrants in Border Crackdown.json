That is what happened last week at Budapest\u2019s Keleti train station when Hungary temporarily cut off access for migrants to westbound trains.\n\nAnd it is what is beginning to happen now in northern Serbia.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the messages we have been sending migrants for a long time have reached them,\u201d said Gyorgy Bakondi, an aide to Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary. \u201cDon\u2019t come. Because this route doesn\u2019t lead where you want to go.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIndeed, Hungarian officials said, after several days that saw record numbers of migrants crossing the border \u2014 9,000 on Monday alone \u2014 the numbers were much lower on Tuesday, proof that people were heeding the warning, or at least waiting for the picture to clear.\n\n\u201cI knew they would close it, but I thought maybe they\u2019d do an exception,\u201d said Salib Yussef, 57, who had arrived at the border at 3 a.m. with his two wives and two sons. \u201cWe were just three hours late! Now I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d\n\nAlready, maps were circulating on social media and on leaflets in some migrant camps showing alternate routes to Western Europe. They suggested going west through Croatia and Slovenia, rather than north through Hungary, or trying the land border connecting Turkey with Bulgaria, also protected by a razor-wire fence and patrolled by the police.\n\nCroatia\u2019s border chief, Zlatko Sokolar, said the country would deploy 6,000 police officers along the border, although there were still only a handful of migrants trying to pass through Croatia. That may well change in coming days, he said.\n\nLatest Developments\n\n\u201cWe will not make the mistake we have seen in other countries,\u201d Mr. Sokolar said. In Slovenia \u2014 which, like Hungary, is a European Union member and a member of the passport-free Schengen zone \u2014 preparations were also being made for a possible influx. The country is preparing to accept \u201cseveral thousand\u201d migrants, the Interior Ministry said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAustria said it, too, was preparing for the likelihood that more migrants would enter through Slovenia and was set to deploy 2,200 troops to patrol the borders.\n\nIn Hungary, Mr. Orban has taken a hard line talking about the threat the arrivals, most of whom are Muslim, present to Europe\u2019s Christian culture. On Tuesday, his government declared a \u201cstate of crisis\u201d along the border and rolled out new revisions to laws that include harsh penalties, including prison time, for those crossing the border illegally or damaging the border fence. The new policy also calls for the creation of \u201ctransit zones\u201d right at the border, small encampments that Hungarian authorities say do not constitute entering the country and where migrants could be received and quickly evaluated. Other changes still being discussed include activating the military to help protect the border and granting the police new powers, including the ability to enter a private residence at will if they suspect migrants are being hidden there.\n\nOn Tuesday, the plan began to take shape at the closed Roszke crossing. About 100 people lined up to get through the trailer\u2019s door while workers began to create the transit zone nearby. Some people continued to try to sneak across the border, and government officials said that more than 180 people had been arrested under the new laws. The cases will be handled on an expedited basis, officials said, taking priority over all other cases working their way through the Hungarian court system.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Hungarians say the arrivals, even those fleeing war in Syria, should not be considered refugees after they reach Hungarian soil because they passed through several \u201csafe countries\u201d first. The Hungarians argue that the migrants have no right to simply choose a country.\n\nOne of the countries Hungary deems \u201csafe\u201d is Serbia, so officials in Budapest argue they have the right to turn back those who try to cross from there.\n\nThe Serbians disagree, and international organizations cast a skeptical eye on the new Hungarian laws. \u201cAsylum seekers and refugees cannot be turned away from the border,\u201d said Babar Baloch, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Hungary. \u201cWe want them to apply international rules under which they have obligations to these people.\u201d\n\nOn a visit to the border region, Aleksandar Vulin, Serbia\u2019s minister of labor, employment and social affairs, said the situation was becoming \u201ccomplicated\u201d and could quickly \u201cgo out of control.\u201d The migrants who are taken through that white door, fingerprinted and questioned have entered Hungary, as far as Serbia is concerned, he said.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, though, only 48 migrants had gotten through that door; 13 of them, who had their applications denied on the spot, were sent back to Serbia \u2014 or to rejoin the crowd sitting on the highway outside \u2014 while three more demanded to appeal the decision.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOmar Abdi Macruf, from Somalia, walked out of the trailer, shaking his head sadly. His application had been rejected, and he was not sure why. The only paper they gave him was in Hungarian, which he cannot read.\n\n\u201cI am not the only one,\u201d he said. \u201cSeveral people from Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan were rejected. And now Serbia says they don\u2019t want us back because we already left our fingerprints with the Hungarians.\u201d\n\nWith migrants struggling to find new routes into Europe, thousands poured into northwestern Turkey over the weekend. A hundred of them, gathered in a small square in the heart of Edirne, demanded a solution to the crisis. \u201cWe want the world to treat us as humans,\u201d said Nawar Alghousini, 21, who arrived in Turkey nine months ago from Syria. \u201cWe are not terrorists. We escaped war, and we want to have a normal life.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Turkish police had tightened security in the province and begun fining drivers who transported refugees to Edirne. And Gov. Dursun Ali Sahin said that most of the 8,000 migrants who came to Edirne over the weekend had returned to Istanbul.\n\nIn Belgrade, the crowds of migrants who gathered in the city center had all but disappeared by Tuesday. In a reception center of Refugee Aid Serbia, an umbrella aid group, only a handful of people sat at tables, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes and charging their cellphones.\n\nSome of the migrants said they simply did not think that Hungary would continue to block the border.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe they would do such a thing,\u201d said Bashar Makansi, 47, a salesman from Aleppo, Syria. \u201cI will continue on the same route. My wife and children are already in Germany. What else can I do?\u201d\n\nWhile Hungary was announcing new procedures, Germany and Austria were trying to figure out what to do with the thousands who had already arrived.\n\nAt Vienna\u2019s Westbahnhof train station, a gateway into Germany for those who make it out of Hungary, the mood was more tense on Tuesday. Migrants were uncertain how their journey would continue, with the new German border controls up ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was in line for that train, but five guys shoved ahead of me,\u201d said Hassan Hassan, 28, a Kurdish Syrian from Aleppo. \u201cI was the first the conductors would not let get on.\u201d\n\nThe mood was decidedly more upbeat in Germany among those who had made it through.\n\nHoussam Aldin, 47, from Damascus, said residents in the town of Frauenstein had left bottles of water and apples for the passing refugees.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a child, my teachers told me that we are all brothers in the Arab world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, I have to say I found new brothers in Europe.\u201d"}
