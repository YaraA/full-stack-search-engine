{"title": "Alternative for Germany: Who Are They, and What Do They Want?", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/world/europe/germany-election-afd.html", "body": "On Monday Ms. Petry appeared to continue her spat with other party leaders, announcing that she would not join AfD\u2019s caucus in Parliament.\n\nThe party\u2019s leading candidates in the election, who are now expected to take charge of that caucus, were Mr. Gauland, 76, a former newspaper publisher who had run the office a Christian Democrat governor in Hesse, and Alice Weidel, 38, an economist who worked for Goldman Sachs as a banker.\n\nDespite their nationalist rhetoric, the leaders are diverse in ways that have gotten notice. Ms. Petry was, like Ms. Merkel, trained as a scientist, and is fluent in English. Ms. Weidel is fluent in Mandarin and is raising children with her female partner.\n\nVideo\n\nIts positions\n\nAlternative for Germany promised to restore law and order and a sense of national pride \u2014 a theme that causes deep unease among many Germans. After the results of the vote were broadcast, demonstrations decrying the party\u2019s nationalist rhetoric and accusing it of flirting with Nazism broke out in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Cologne.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no right to Nazi propaganda!\u201d protesters shouted outside AfD\u2019s election-night party.\n\nMs. Weidel said the party would \u201cinitiate a parliamentary investigative committee against Angela Merkel,\u201d challenging the legal basis of her migration policies, and \u201cvery decidedly take up the breaches of law by this lady.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe party also promised to increase border security, to push back against further European Union integration and to oppose the use of German taxpayer money to bail out foreign banks. It wants to revamp the pensions system, cutting a government program that rewards private pensions savers.\n\nThe party has flirted with anti-Islamic sentiment, rejecting inclusive language used by Ms. Merkel and past presidents and saying that a religion that does not respect the constitution and laws of the country is not compatible with German democracy.\n\nPhoto\n\nIts supporters\n\nOf the nearly 6 million votes Alternative for Germany won on Sunday, preliminary results show 1.2 million came from voters who had stayed home in previous elections. But another million had been pulled away from the chancellor\u2019s bloc \u2014 including many from the Christian Social Union, a sister party of her Christian Democratic Union that has been the dominant political force in the southern state of Bavaria for decades.\n\nBut AfD also drew from the political left, with support from nearly 500,000 voters who had previously supported the center-left Social Democrats and 400,000 who had voted for the Left Party. AfD appealed to people\u2019s sense that lawmakers had failed to listen to individual concerns of loss of orientation in an increasingly globalized world.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She said it had not done enough to stand up to Ms. Merkel.\n\n\u201cI want to finally be a part of something new, to see us become a force in the Bundestag that is able to break up the uniform mushiness of the represented parties,\u201d she said.\n\nIts challenges\n\nAlternative for Germany emerged as the third-largest party in Parliament, with 94 out of 709 seats. It is unlikely to lead the opposition: That influential role will go to the second-place Social Democratic Party, which formed a coalition with Ms. Merkel\u2019s group after the last national elections but has said that it will not do so this time.\n\nHow strong AfD will be will depend in large part on whether it can hold its caucus together. Hours after its historic victory, becoming the first party to the right of the chancellor\u2019s center-right bloc to make it into Parliament, cracks were beginning to show.\n\nMs. Petry, who secured a seat in Parliament through a direct vote in her eastern state of Saxony \u2014 candidates can be elected either as individuals or from a party list \u2014 took to the country\u2019s main breakfast TV show to challenge comments Mr. Gauland had made during the election party about \u201chunting\u201d the chancellor. Then, at a news conference alongside Mr. Gauland and Ms. Weidel, she announced her decision not to join AfD\u2019s parliamentary caucus, and stormed out without taking questions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuch theatrics lay plain that the young party will need to get its house in order if it wants to even begin to be a constructive opposition force.\n\nPhoto\n\nIts impact\n\nParadoxically, AfD\u2019s entrance into Parliament has set the stage for a centrist government that will make overtures to the right but will remain staunchly pro-European, said Timo Lochocki, a trans-Atlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n\u201cThey can influence rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Lochocki said of the AfD, but whether the party remains a force capable of exerting influence will depend largely on whether the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats are able to win back voters on such emotional issues as immigration and the common European currency, the euro, as they have pledged to do.\n\nAfD had demonstrated that disgruntlement about immigration and the euro were potent issues for perhaps 5 to 10 percent of voters, Mr. Lochocki said \u2014 issues that it would want to keep alive.\n\nHe added that elections had historically been focused on economics, but a split had emerged because of the refugee crisis. \u201cThese cleavages never decided elections because migration was not an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it is.\u201d"}
