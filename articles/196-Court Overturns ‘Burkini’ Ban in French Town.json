The center-right former president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who has announced his plans to run for president again, supports a national ban.\n\nWhile the decision does not apply directly to the many other French cities and towns that have banned the burkini, it amounts to a warning that their prohibitions are likely to be overturned if challenged. The largest such community is the city of Nice.\n\nThe United Nations and the White House seemed relieved by the ruling.\n\n\u201cObviously we welcome the decision by the court,\u201d Secretary General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s chief spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, who had expressed concern about the burkini ban, said at a news briefing, emphasizing \u201cthe need for people\u2019s personal dignity to be respected.\u201d\n\nJosh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said the United States did not want to \u201csecond-guess\u201d France, but noted that President Obama \u201cbelieves strongly in the freedom of religion.\u201d\n\nCritics of the bans have said they unfairly targeted Muslims in the wake of deadly terrorist attacks in France and elsewhere in Europe. The bans provoked a backlash, particularly photographs spread online showing armed police officers confronting women wearing burkinis, or other clothing \u2014 like a veil, a tunic and leggings \u2014 covering most of the body.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPatrice Spinosi, a lawyer for the Human Rights League, one of the groups that had challenged the ban, said his association would now ask mayors in other towns to withdraw their bans.\n\n\u201cThe council has ruled and has showed that mayors do not have the right to set limits on wearing religious signs in public spaces,\u201d he said, in the absence of a demonstrated threat to public order. \u201cIt is contrary to the freedom of religion, which is a fundamental freedom.\u201d\n\nVilleneuve-Loubet, a seaside resort of about 14,000, adopted the ban on Aug. 5, and it was supposed to end on Sept. 15. Police officers in the town will no longer be able to issue fines for burkini-wearing, and women who received fines will be able to contest them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Most of the prohibitions are temporary and run until the end of the holiday season.\n\nThe town\u2019s mayor, Lionnel Luca, denounced the ruling. \u201cApparently, the terrorist attacks in Nice were not sufficiently traumatic,\u201d he said sarcastically at a news conference on Friday afternoon, referring to the rampage by a truck driver who attacked a Bastille Day fireworks celebration on July 14, causing 86 deaths. \u201cThis decision will raise tensions and passions.\u201d\n\nMarwan Muhammad, the head of the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, another group that challenged the bans, praised the ruling, but expressed concern that other communities might drag their feet on rescinding their bans.\n\n\u201cNormally, mayors should remove their ordinances following this decision, except if they want to race against the clock and go to court,\u201d Mr. Muhammad said, noting that the ordinances are set to expire in the coming weeks, while the court process can drag on for longer. Several mayors have already told French media that they did not intend to remove their bans in light of the ruling.\n\nThe ordinances in question did not mention Islam or the burkinis explicitly \u2014 instead banned bathing attire that was not \u201cappropriate,\u201d was not \u201crespectful of good morals and of secularism,\u201d or did not respect \u201chygiene and security rules\u201d \u2014 but the target of the laws was obvious.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Council of State said the \u201cemotions and concerns that are the result of the terrorist attacks, most notably the one carried out in Nice last July 14, do not suffice to legally justify the ban.\u201d\n\nRestrictions on liberty \u201cmust be justified by proven risks to public order,\u201d the court said, finding that the town\u2019s mayor had failed to meet that criterion.\n\nAnti-discrimination and human rights groups had challenged the restrictions in local courts, but the rules were upheld, leading the groups to appeal to the Council of State, which heard arguments from lawyers for both sides on Thursday.\n\nThe bans have also fueled an intense political debate and split the French government, with Mr. Valls expressing support for them and several female ministers opposing the restrictions, even as they voiced distaste for the garments.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the head of the far-right National Front, said after the ruling that French lawmakers should expand a 2004 law that bans ostentatious religious symbols in schools to all public places, except for \u201creligious personnel,\u201d but she did not make clear how broad that exception should be.\n\nThe showdown over the burkini was only the latest controversy over the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9, or secularism, that has been a defining feature of French political life since the Revolution. Critics say the principle is increasingly used to justify measures that single out Muslims, rather than keeping government out of religion and vice versa, the original intent.\n\nJean-Pierre Mignard, a legal expert who is close to Mr. Hollande, predicted that the controversy would continue. \u201cThe fact that some elected officials are already contesting the Council of State\u2019s decision shows that they have now entered an ideological showdown,\u201d he said, while adding that if an anti-burkini law were put forward in Parliament, it would not likely pass muster with the country\u2019s Constitutional Council.\n\nPaul Cassia, a professor of public law at the University of Paris, said the decision on Friday \u201ccreates a precedent that applies to all the towns,\u201d and \u201ca strong presumption\u201d that such bans are unlawful.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the ruling on Friday technically suspended the ban, Mr. Cassia said the decision effectively overturned the prohibition completely and showed that the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 had been misapplied by the towns.\n\n\u201cIt means neutrality for the state, not the individual,\u201d Mr. Cassia said.\n\nHe added: \u201cI was in Nice two days ago. There are women in the street with veils. It\u2019s completely unreasonable to ban them from the beach, while they are free to walk around the city. It\u2019s hysteria.\u201d\n\nMr. Muhammad, the head of the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, said he feared that in the current political climate, Muslims would continue to be targeted.\n\n\u201cNow that it is over with the beach, they are going to come back with the debate on long skirts or on halal meals,\u201d he said.", "summary": "The bans provoked a backlash, particularly photographs spread online showing armed police officers confronting women wearing burkinis, or other clothing \u2014 like a veil, a tunic and leggings \u2014 covering most of the body.
