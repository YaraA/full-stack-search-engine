He said that France had a \u201cfurious desire for things to change.\u201d\n\nThat last point is far from clear.

He is playing double or nothing.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Grunberg dismissed Mr. Macron\u2019s strategy of presenting himself as an anti-establishment candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, because he\u2019s so much a member of the establishment, he can\u2019t play the populist card,\u201d he said, noting his close connection to \u201cthe ruling classes\u201d and the difficulty he will have connecting with the less-exalted in French society.", "summary": "Mr. Macron, a former banker, has spent two years questioning Socialist orthodoxy on doctrines like the 35-hour workweek and ironclad job protections, and this spring he founded his own political movement, En Marche, or On Our Way.But Tuesday night, he cast away allegiance to the party, and in over an hour of lofty rhetoric, Mr. Macron repeatedly suggested in front of thousands of cheering supporters that he was the man \u201cto change the country.\u201dThroughout the spring and summer, France has been hit by a wave of strikes and demonstrations, most supported by a majority of the population, protesting a modest economic overhaul law partly inspired by Mr. Macron\u2019s pro-free-market ideas.The limited overhauls he had earlier proposed \u2014 opening up intercity bus routes and loosening restrictions on Sunday work hours \u2014 had to be forced through Parliament last year by the Socialists.Indeed, angry anti-Macron union demonstrators besieged the Left Bank meeting hall where the economy minister spoke Tuesday night, forcing his supporters to run a gantlet of police officers and protesters."}
