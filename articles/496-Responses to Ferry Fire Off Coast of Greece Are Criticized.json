I thought, it\u2019s now or never. It was awful. I will never forget it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Theodossiou told the newspaper that no alarms had sounded and that she awoke in her first-class cabin after smelling smoke. Initially, she said, she went to the lower deck because the lifeboats were there. \u201cSome were put at sea, others weren\u2019t, and I don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said.\n\nChristos Perlis, 32, a Greek truck driver interviewed by The Associated Press, also said that men had tried to punch their way forward. \u201cEveryone there was trampling on each other to get onto the helicopter,\u201d he said.\n\nSpray from the fireboats soaked the already cold passengers. \u201cOur feet were burning, and from the feet up we were soaked,\u201d Mr. Perlis added.\n\nAn unidentified man interviewed by television reporters in the Italian port of Bari said several people had fallen overboard in the darkness.\n\nItalian, Greek and Albanian rescue workers had accounted for 427 people as of Monday afternoon, the authorities said. But that number fell short of the 478 passengers and crew listed on the original manifest. Adding to the confusion, some of the passengers rescued were not listed on the manifest at all, and may have been on the ship illegally.\n\n\u201cWe hope that no other people are missing,\u201d Maurizio Lupi, Italy\u2019s transportation minister, told a news conference Monday in Rome. It would be premature to tally how many people might be missing, he added, noting that the ferry had made a stop in Greece before sailing for Italy and that some passengers might have gotten off there, and that others might have been no-shows.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nItalian officials said that only after the names of the survivors had been checked against a definitive manifest of the passengers onboard would it be possible to effectively determine whether others were still missing.\n\nPhoto\n\nAll the crew members \u2014 of both Greek and Italian nationality \u2014 were accounted for.\n\nItalian officials spoke proudly of the rescue efforts, which evolved over some 30 hours and involved dozens of vessels, helicopters and planes.\n\nThe ship\u2019s commander, Argilio Giacomazzi, was the last to leave the vessel, Italian officials said. The gesture, in keeping with maritime tradition, caught the attention of Italians still smarting from another maritime disaster: that of the Costa Concordia, which capsized when it ran aground in Tuscany in January 2012, killing 32 people. The captain of the Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, was later charged with manslaughter and accused of causing the shipwreck and abandoning the cruise liner before everyone was evacuated,\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Other passengers \u2014 some suffering from hypothermia or smoke inhalation \u2014 were taken directly to hospitals on the Italian mainland by helicopter.\n\nWhile the cause of the blaze remained unclear, prosecutors in Bari and Brindisi said they would open an investigation. The Italian news media reported that the ship had not passed an inspection in Greece this month. Yet an Italian admiral said Monday that the repairs had been made after the inspection and that the ship was seaworthy when it set sail on Sunday.\n\nThe Italian owner of the ship \u2014 which was built in 2009 and was sailing under an Italian flag even though it had been chartered by a Greek company \u2014 also insisted that the vessel was seaworthy.\n\nThe ship was still floating in the Adriatic off the Albanian coast on Monday. Officials in both Italy and Albania said that they planned to confiscate it."}
