That enemy coordinated complex, military-style assaults against a subset of targets that, while civilian, held symbolic or political value. Governments could anticipate and defend the targets, monitor or disrupt the groups, and ultimately defeat them by targeting their leaders and seizing their territory.\n\nBut the threat has evolved into something much harder to counter. Insurgent groups in mid-2000s Iraq, unable to defeat the American-led occupation force, instead targeted Iraqi civilians wherever they gathered, establishing a method that terror groups now deploy internationally.\n\nIn 2008, Pakistani militants killed 166 people in Mumbai, India, attacking what experts call \u201csoft\u201d targets: places such as hotels and train stations that are populated but, because of their seeming randomness, rarely defended. At security conferences in Western capitals, officials and analysts began to worry about whether they could prevent a \u201cMumbai-style attack\u201d in their own countries.\n\nThen came the rise of \u201clone wolf\u201d attackers who acted on their own, without training from or often even contact with the terrorist groups they claimed to serve. Attacks are planned within the minds of individuals whose intentions remain hidden until the shooting begins.\n\nSuch attacks predate the Islamic State, though the group emphasizes them, disseminating propaganda that provides tactical guidance and ideological justification available to anyone with an internet connection.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe use of a truck in Nice was new only in the specifics and in the degree to which it has forced a realization increasingly difficult to ignore: In the world of lone wolves and Mumbai-style attacks, more barricades and metal detectors and monitoring programs can improve security, but can\u2019t guarantee it absolutely.\n\nWhat will it take?\n\nAs terrorism itself becomes harder to prevent or defend against, policy experts say that governments should instead address two deeper but murkier problems: the ideology that calls for such violence and, even harder, the social and political factors that drive an individual to accept that ideology.\n\nBut how do you defeat an ideology? Destroying the Islamic State\u2019s so-called \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Iraq and Syria, some argue, would undercut its grandiose claims and dampen its appeal. It would also limit the group\u2019s ability to coordinate large-scale attacks, which in turn help inspire lone actors who may, or may not, be driven by ideology.\n\nStill, even as the group loses territory, its propaganda would survive online. And the problems that contributed to that ideology\u2019s rise in the Middle East would remain: authoritarian states that often use violence themselves, religious institutions often seen as complicit, stifled economies that grant young people few opportunities, and a cycle of conflict that encourages tribalism and extremism.\n\nThis is why many analysts are urging Western governments to look at their own populations and ask not whether terrorist ideologies can be eradicated, but why individual citizens might become susceptible to messages telling them to kill on behalf of a foreign terrorist group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a social and political problem,\u201d said Peter Neumann, a professor at King\u2019s College London and the director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization.\n\nMr. Neumann said that, increasingly, Western citizens who turn to terrorism \u201care not deeply ideological or even religious.\"\n\nRather, such individuals often seem to come to terrorism as a way to bring meaning to their lives or to explain their own sense of helplessness or isolation.\n\nMuslim or migrant populations have struggled to integrate into Western European countries, often left feeling excluded from national identities that stress secularism and are rooted in specifically European heritage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cGhettoization, polarization, and alienation in a country like France are profound,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cBottom line is: it\u2019s about feeling like you belong.\u201d\n\nWestern governments have tried to address this by providing greater welfare programs to disadvantaged communities or, often, by more forcefully policing them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bush declared a \u201cwar on terror,\u201d Western leaders have used the terminology of war both to explain the threat and to articulate their response.\n\n\u201cIt is a war against terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam,\u201c Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, said after a terrorist attack in the Paris area in January 2015.\n\nA decade and a half of war has not delivered Western populations to safety, highlighting the gap between rhetoric and reality. But politicians have been constrained by this language, unable to acknowledge that, while war is a struggle that pulls a nation together and can eventually be won, the realities of terrorism can only be managed and the threats, at some point, merely endured.\n\nBut political leaders, compelled to promise an answer to this week\u2019s violence in Nice, returned to the familiar formulations.\n\n\u201cWe have an enemy that will continue to strike all people, all countries that have liberties as essential values,\u201d France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHillary Clinton told CNN on Thursday that \u201cwe are at war with these terrorist groups and what they represent.\u201d Though she urged enhanced intelligence gathering to combat terrorism, she has previously called for more aggressive use of force against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.\n\nDonald J. Trump, in an interview with Fox News, said he would ask Congress to declare war on terrorism.\n\nWhile this framing might reassure, it raises a question: Why does the war never feel as if it is approaching victory?\n\nThis question\u2019s unanswerability perhaps contributes to the fear that is increasingly destabilizing Western politics. And it creates space for right-wing populists, rising throughout Europe, to present more aggressive policies as the answer.\n\n\u201cNothing that we have proposed has been put in place,\u201d Marine Le Pen, who leads the right-wing National Front party, told the French newspaper Le Figaro, calling for measures to revoke citizens\u2019 nationality, close certain mosques and ban organizations.\n\nMr. Valls, the French prime minister, perhaps sought to break this cycle on Friday when he said, \u201cThe times have changed, and France is going to have to live with terrorism.\u201d", "summary": "In 2008, Pakistani militants killed 166 people in Mumbai, India, attacking what experts call \u201csoft\u201d targets: places such as hotels and train stations that are populated but, because of their seeming randomness, rarely defended.The use of a truck in Nice was new only in the specifics and in the degree to which it has forced a realization increasingly difficult to ignore: In the world of lone wolves and Mumbai-style attacks, more barricades and metal detectors and monitoring programs can improve security, but can\u2019t guarantee it absolutely.And the problems that contributed to that ideology\u2019s rise in the Middle East would remain: authoritarian states that often use violence themselves, religious institutions often seen as complicit, stifled economies that grant young people few opportunities, and a cycle of conflict that encourages tribalism and extremism.But these, Mr. Neumann said, risk deepening the polarization between communities, which can be bridged only by building an \u201cinclusive sense of national identity.\u201d European societies have resisted this, instead giving rise to right-wing politics that emphasize ethnic and religious heritage.Hillary Clinton told CNN on Thursday that \u201cwe are at war with these terrorist groups and what they represent.\u201d Though she urged enhanced intelligence gathering to combat terrorism, she has previously called for more aggressive use of force against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq."}
