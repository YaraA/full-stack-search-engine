{"title": "In Angela Merkel, German Women Find Symbol, but Not Savior", "authors": ["Katrin Bennhold"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/world/europe/angela-merkel-germany-election.html", "body": "Even in politics, where the chancellor has proved a role model for many and has vowed to appoint a gender-balanced cabinet if re-elected, the number of women in Parliament is already certain to drop, whatever the outcome of the vote a week from Sunday.\n\nIt is a strange contradiction. Ms. Merkel embodies what feminists the world over have hoped to accomplish, but the rest of Germany has largely not caught up.\n\nA generation of young Germans has grown up with a woman in the highest office. Children ask their parents if boys can become chancellor. Male rivals struggle to position themselves against Ms. Merkel, whose unexcitable and deliberative style has made the fist-banging swagger of her predecessors a parody of the past.\n\nAlice Schwarzer, the country\u2019s best-known feminist, put it this way: \u201cSince 2005, little girls can decide: Do I become a hairdresser \u2014 or chancellor?\u201d\n\nBut ask Ms. Auf der Masch and the 14 other apprentices in her class how many of the local companies that train them \u2014 midsize businesses that make everything from margarine to mobility scooters \u2014 are run by women. Not a single hand goes up.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere are a few female department heads, most of them childless. But collectively the apprentices can think of more managers called \u201cThomas\u201d than managers who are women.\n\nThere are, in fact, more C.E.O.s named \u201cThomas\u201d (seven) than C.E.O.s who are women (three) in Germany\u2019s 160 publicly traded companies, notes the AllBright foundation, which tracks women in corporate leadership. Ninety-three percent of all executive board members in these companies are men. Nearly three out of four of the corporations have no women on their executive teams.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nObliged by law to publish a target for hiring women at the executive level, most happily wrote down \u201c0 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of Merkel, the image of Germany abroad is more progressive than it really is,\u201d said Anne Wizorek, a feminist writer who rose to prominence in 2013 when she led a highly visible hashtag campaign against casual sexism.\n\nSome things, from child care to corporate governance, have, in fact, changed for women under Ms. Merkel\u2019s watch.\n\nBut so deep remains the cultural bias against working women, and especially working mothers, that some young commentators now mention Germany\u2019s \u201cgender issue\u201d in the same breath as America\u2019s \u201crace issue\u201d \u2014 a piece of historic baggage that has never been fully addressed, elusive and omnipresent at the same time, a sort of national elephant in the room.\n\n\u201cJust as Obama did not end structural racism in America, Merkel has not ended structural sexism in Germany,\u201d Ms. Wizorek said.\n\nIn some ways, Ms. Merkel\u2019s long tenure has actually made things more complicated, she said. \u201cWe are told: \u2018You can become chancellor \u2014 what more do you want?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Wizorek said. \u201cI hear that all the time.\u201d\n\nThe few women who do make it to the top, or close to it, speak of the constant torment of being judged.\n\n\u201cWe get no respect from society as working women,\u201d said Angelika Huber-Strasser, a managing partner for KPMG Germany and a mother of three. \u201cThey call us raven mothers,\u201d after the black bird (also unfairly) accused of pushing its young out of the nest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is a feeling of damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf you stay at home and have children, you\u2019re not contributing to society,\u201d Ms. Huber-Strasser said. \u201cIf you work and have children, you are a raven mother. If you work and have no children, you\u2019re a cold woman. All paths for women in Germany are difficult. Here, Merkel has not helped.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnka Wittenberg, chief diversity and inclusion officer at SAP, a German software company, already had her three children when she finished a master\u2019s degree in economics and sent out job applications. No German company invited her for an interview.\n\nShe made her career in American companies instead, rising through the ranks of General Electric\u2019s German operation before being hired by SAP, a company that is considered unusually progressive for having two women among its eight executive board members (though neither of them is German).\n\n\u201cWe have hardly any female role models that show young women that it is possible to have both: a family and a career,\u201d said Ms. Wittenberg. \u201cGermany is still very much behind.\u201d\n\nThe \u00fcber-mother of German lore has roots in the country\u2019s difficult history. The Nazis awarded medals to women who bore multiple children. Then came Germany\u2019s division: The West revived the 19th century maxim of Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche \u2014 children, kitchen, church, while in the East, the Communists set up free day-care centers.\n\nEastern mothers drove cranes and studied physics. Until 1977, western wives officially needed their husbands\u2019 permission to work. By then, their peers in the East had a year of paid maternity leave and shorter work hours if they nursed.\n\nWhen the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, female employment in the East was near 90 percent; in the West it was 55 percent. Today, over 70 percent of German women work. But only 12 percent of those with children under 3 work full time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that Ms. Merkel has no children herself and grew up in East Germany.\n\n\u201cAngela Merkel considers things normal that many women who grew up in West Germany consider anything but normal,\u201d said Jutta Allmendinger, a leading German sociologist and president of the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.\n\nMs. Merkel has not made gender equality a signature issue. But during her time in office things have quietly evolved.\n\nSchools, which traditionally closed at lunchtime, relying on stay-at-home mothers, have gradually lengthened their hours. Child care, once anathema for children under 3, has been vastly extended. A paid parental leave has been introduced that nudges fathers to take at least two months.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Morning Briefing What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox.

In some areas the number of women in leadership positions has actually been sliding back.\n\nAmong the publicly traded businesses in Germany\u2019s internationally revered Mittelstand, the midsize companies that are the backbone of Germany\u2019s well-oiled export machine, fewer than 4 percent of executive jobs are held by women.\n\nEven the modest progress women have made has been met with a fierce backlash in some quarters.\n\nBirgit Kelle, a member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic party and author of a recent book called \u201cMother Animal,\u201d has accused the chancellor of abandoning conservative values. \u201cIn my view it\u2019s almost communism that we practice,\u201d she said. \u201cG.D.R. 2.0, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going for.\u201d The reference was to the former Communist East Germany, known as the German Democratic Republic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI used to be in the mainstream of the party,\u201d Ms. Kelle said, \u201cnow I\u2019m being pushed to the right edge.\u201d Some of her former party colleagues have defected to the far-right Alternative for Germany party. Its election poster shows women in bikinis, in dirndls or pregnant.\n\nNewly minted terms like \u201cgender-hype\u201d and \u201cgender-wahn\u201d \u2014 gender madness \u2014 are circulating. Some prominent professors of gender studies have had to request personal protection after receiving threats to their safety.\n\nThat has Ms. Allmendinger worried. \u201cThis battle is not won,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that progress is more fragile here than in countries like America or France.\u201d Germany, she said, needs a feminist movement.\n\nAt the vocational school in Osnabr\u00fcck, the apprentices yearned for change. The men said they wanted to take parental leave (at least, some did) and several women said they wanted to have a successful career (at least until they have children).\n\nBut no one called themselves a feminist. \u201cThat\u2019s too radical,\u201d one young woman said. Their teacher, Monika Stadje, 63, said the term still conjured up a caricature of \u201clesbians in motorcycle gear who are very, very angry and don\u2019t like men.\u201d\n\nThat helps explain why Ms. Merkel, ever mindful of public opinion, has so far refused to claim the label for herself. But some young women wish she would.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t she, as one of the most powerful people in the world, for once make a fundamental statement about gender equality?\u201d asked Margarete Stokowski, a columnist for Spiegel online. \u201cShe avoids the whole topic because she knows if she opened it up, she would have to acknowledge just how much is still not O.K.\u201d"}
