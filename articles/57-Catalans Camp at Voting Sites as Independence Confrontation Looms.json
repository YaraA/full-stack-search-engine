{"title": "Catalans Camp at Voting Sites as Independence Confrontation Looms", "authors": ["Ellen Barry", "Raphael Minder"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/world/europe/catalonia-independence-referendum.html", "body": "But a large number of Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million residents are likely to ignore that warning, presenting Mr. Rajoy with the uncomfortable choice between using security forces to clear large crowds, or allowing the vote to take place and thereby acknowledging that the nation\u2019s government in Madrid was unable to control events. Among the central players on Sunday will be Catalonia\u2019s regional police, who number 17,000, and who have signaled reluctance to use force on citizens who go to vote.\n\nPolice on Saturday entered the Catalonian regional government\u2019s telecommunications and information technology center after a court on Friday ordered them to stop electronic voting. The court also ordered Google to eliminate an application designed to help Catalans identify polling stations.\n\nOpinion polls have indicated that less than half of the region\u2019s residents support independence \u2014 though a majority want to vote on the region\u2019s future \u2014 and crowds gathered on Saturday in Catalonian cities and towns to call for unity with Spain.\n\nFernando Satue, 67, a retired mechanic who was born in Huesca and has lived in Catalonia since he was 5, said that the mounting demand for independence has made him apprehensive about expressing his opinions in public.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBoth sides have been very stubborn, the Spanish and the Catalan, and the only victims are going to be us,\u201d Mr. Satue said. \u201cI have a very clear position: If this is a republic, I will have to leave. Because I feel like this is being forced on me.\u201d\n\nHe said he planned to stay home on Sunday, in part out of fear of unrest.\n\n\u201cA lot of things have been said, and at the end there will be violence,\u201d Mr. Satue said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Maria Lluisa Ines Sallavona, 71, said she was doing Sudoku puzzles \u201cin a really nice and relaxed ambience\u201d when she was hit in the neck by a pellet.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI guess this is some kind of fanatic who has an allergy to independence,\u201d said her husband, Lluis Sallavona Rovira, 77, a retired electronic technician, who sought medical attention for a wound in his back.\n\nIn many locations, the police made repeated visits to warn the people inside that they would have to leave by 6 a.m. on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe message right now is that anything could happen \u2014 anything,\u201d said Belen Parra, 44, who had just served paella to 125 people. \u201cEverybody is nervous, but no one is showing it.\u201d"}
