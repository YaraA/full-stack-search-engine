{"title": "Migrant Influx in Germany Raises Fears of Anti-Semitism", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/world/europe/migrant-germany-antisemitism-muslim-jews.html", "body": "Ms. Merkel is an unflinching supporter of Israel and Jewish institutions. Schoolchildren learn about the Holocaust, and Germany is promising classes to instruct new arrivals in its standards, customs and beliefs. Events to celebrate Jewish identity and the role of Jews in Germany are common. Leading politicians and city figures gathered on Jan. 7 for the 90th birthday of W. Michael Blumenthal, the former United States Treasury secretary and founding chief executive of the Jewish Museum Berlin, which has counted 10 million visitors since it opened in 2001.\n\nMr. Blumenthal, born and raised in and around Berlin before his family fled the Nazis, is among the many Americans who have praised Ms. Merkel for welcoming refugees.\n\nYet even before the migrant influx, synagogues, Jewish schools and other organizations operated only under constant police protection. And now, there is apprehension over the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muslims raised in countries where anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment are more virulent than in Turkey, the country of origin for most of Germany\u2019s perhaps four million Muslims.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Salomon Korn, the head of Frankfurt\u2019s Jewish community, put it in a public discussion this month: With the new arrivals, \u201cwe must operate on the assumption that they have a different relationship to Jews than the Muslims who have lived here to date.\u201d\n\nThere have been no reports of anti-Semitic attacks by recently arrived migrants.\n\nEven before the tide of migrants, some Jews worried that anti-Jewish sentiment was again becoming acceptable.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She expressed concern that politicians were content with lofty speeches that missed the reality on the ground.\n\nIn the Ruhr city of Wuppertal, the 2,000-strong Jewish community was outraged last year when a court gave only a probationary sentence to three Palestinians who threw gasoline bomb at the local synagogue in 2014. The three said they were protesting war in Gaza.\n\nAn appeal on Jan. 18 resulted in stiffer sentences but did not acknowledge that anti-Semitism was involved, said Leonid Goldberg, a leader of the Jewish community in Wuppertal. \u201cIt is nothing less than an invitation to all others to behave the same,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd with all the new Muslim arrivals, it will get worse, he feared.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t change just because they live in Germany,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Leading politicians and city figures gathered on Jan. 7 for the 90th birthday of W.
