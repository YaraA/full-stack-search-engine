Ms. Merkel\u2019s popularity at home has plunged, and her ruling Christian Democratic Union faces serious challenges in state elections this month.\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s attempts to stop migrants from leaving Turkey in the first place have thus far failed, but whether the renewed push Mr. Tusk is developing, with her tacit support, would be any more effective remains deeply uncertain.\n\nTurkey is grappling with a host of other problems stemming from the civil war in Syria \u2014 including an emboldened Kurdish population within its borders, and terrorist attacks by the Islamic State \u2014 and may not be able, or willing, to do what the European Union is asking of it.\n\n\u201cPart of what is on the table is wholesale return of people to Turkey, but on what basis would that happen?\u201d asked Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, a research group in Brussels.\n\nWhile Syrians are seen as having the strongest claim for asylum, the legal status of many Afghans and Iraqis is less clear. The prospect of deporting large numbers of them to Turkey seems difficult at best.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

We don\u2019t. We need to be able to close our borders hermetically, and differentiate economic migrants from refugees.\u201d\n\nMr. Orban did not directly criticize Ms. Merkel, however. \u201cWe otherwise fully support the German plan with Turkey,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt will cost money Hungary is ready to contribute. But it doesn\u2019t replace the protection of our own borders with our own capacities.\u201d\n\nMeeting with Ms. Merkel in Paris, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said that \u201cFrance and Germany are working in the same spirit and with the same desire\u201d to resolve the migrant crisis. Mr. Hollande said France would \u201cfulfill its commitment\u201d to take in \u201c30,000 Syrian or Iraqi refugees\u201d \u2014 but his stance is quite different from that of Ms. Merkel, who has steadfastly refused to cap the number of asylum seekers Germany will take in.\n\nAt a news conference in Brussels, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration, said European leaders hoped to make progress with Turkey on Monday so it agrees to the return of people deemed ineligible for asylum in Europe, including non-Syrians.\n\nTurkey\u2019s prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, has said privately that Turkey is prepared to do just that, according to two people with knowledge of those talks, who spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because the outlines of the agreement have not been made public.\n\nThe plans would involve Greece\u2019s setting up an office to coordinate the return of migrants to Turkey and the placement of one Turkish liaison officer in Greece to help that process, one of the people with knowledge of the discussions said.\n\nEarlier this week, Greece returned more than 300 migrants of various nationalities to Turkey, as a step toward more orderly policies in the region.\n\nIn his letter, Mr. Tusk also urged leaders, who are gathering in Brussels on Monday, to agree on restoring orderly asylum procedures so that migrants are registered and assessed upon arrival, before they journey onward. \u201cWith that we will close the Western Balkans route, which was the main entry point for migrants,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMore than 1.2 million people sought asylum in the European Union last year, double the number from 2014, according to the European statistics agency. Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis accounted for more than half the applications.", "summary": "Turkey is grappling with a host of other problems stemming from the civil war in Syria \u2014 including an emboldened Kurdish population within its borders, and terrorist attacks by the Islamic State \u2014 and may not be able, or willing, to do what the European Union is asking of it. \u201cPart of what is on the table is wholesale return of people to Turkey, but on what basis would that happen?\u201d asked Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, a research group in Brussels. \u201cHungary won\u2019t accept any migrants from Turkey,\u201d the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, said flatly on Friday, after meeting Horst Seehofer, the governor of the southern German state of Bavaria, who has been sharply critical of Ms. Merkel, an erstwhile political ally.
