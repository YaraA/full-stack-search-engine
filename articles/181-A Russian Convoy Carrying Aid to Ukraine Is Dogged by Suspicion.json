{"title": "A Russian Convoy Carrying Aid to Ukraine Is Dogged by Suspicion", "authors": ["Neil Macfarquhar"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/europe/russian-convoy-leaves-moscow-for-ukraine-bearing-aid.html", "body": "Russia dispatched the convoy early Tuesday morning from just outside Moscow, saying it was working with the Red Cross to get emergency aid like generators, medicine, food and water to the residents of Luhansk, a separatist stronghold in eastern Ukraine that government forces have surrounded, cutting off water and electricity service. The convoy was expected to arrive at the border late Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWhile not exactly sure what the Kremlin was up to, Kiev\u2019s Western allies consulted worriedly among themselves before issuing various warnings that the convoy deserved cautious treatment.\n\n\u201cWe must be extremely careful because this could be a cover for the Russians to install themselves near Luhansk and Donetsk,\u201d the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, told France Info radio.\n\n\u201cI cannot judge from here what exactly is on the move from Moscow,\u201d Steffen Seibert, the German government spokesman, said in Berlin. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France had agreed by telephone that to be accepted as a genuine humanitarian mission, the convoy should have several countries participating and be supervised by the Red Cross or some similar neutral international body, Mr. Seibert said.\n\nUkrainian social media lit up with more direct concerns. The drivers would toss aside their flip-flops and prove themselves to be special forces troops once across the border, one suggested, while others suspected that the trucks were really carting ammunition.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainians are suspicious that it is not just clothing and tents inside those trucks, and Russia does not want to provide proof that the things being brought in are not dangerous because they consider it demeaning,\u201d Mr. Eggert said. \u201cIt might provide another reason for a major confrontation.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem is of Mr. Putin\u2019s own making. In annexing Crimea, he established himself as the protector of Russian-speaking populations wherever they might be, and his nationalist supporters expect him to deliver. The aid convoy is a means to fulfill that pledge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut for Ukrainians, Russia is a party to the armed conflict, covertly supplying men and weapons even if Moscow denies the charge. Should the Kremlin sincerely want to provide humanitarian relief, Kiev reasons, it should just rein in its proxies.\n\nIn Geneva, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said that Russian officials had provided a manifest of the supplies, but that the contents still had to be verified and discussions were continuing about the delivery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress at the moment; we are still clarifying the details,\u201d said Ewan Watson, the spokesman. \u201cThere are pieces of the puzzle that remain missing.\u201d\n\nFor their part, Russian officials issued a series of wounded statements that the aid shipment was not being accepted at face value.\n\nPhoto\n\nSergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister, told a news conference that Russia had accepted all of Kiev\u2019s conditions and had spelled them out: the route, the choice of a border crossing near Kharkiv, the use of Ukrainian license plates once across the border, and the presence on the trucks of not only international monitors but representatives of the Ukrainian government as well.\n\nMr. Lavrov said that the delivery plan had been agreed to on Monday, with the logistics left to the Red Cross. He said he expected that the Ukrainian government would guarantee the column\u2019s security, and said the separatist militias would do the same.\n\n\u201cWe have already signaled to them,\u201d said Mr. Lavrov, in a rare public display of Moscow\u2019s influence. \u201cI am certain there will be no disruptions on their part. They are on the territory whose residents need humanitarian aid.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, said in a brief interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about the suspicions. What we care about is the tremendously grave humanitarian situation there.\u201d He added that those with suspicions should concentrate instead on the problems facing civilians in Luhansk.\n\nCity officials issued a statement on Tuesday saying that Luhansk had been completely without power since Aug. 3, that it had no water or sewage services and that the mobile telephone network was not functioning. Of the prewar population of 420,000, some 250,000 people remained, the statement said.\n\nIn Kiev, government officials voiced various opinions about the aid, ranging from barring it completely to transferring it to Ukrainian trucks at the Shebekino-Pletenivka border crossing near Kharkiv.\n\nAt a news conference, Andriy Lysenko, the Ukrainian military spokesman, played a secretly recorded video that he said showed the aid was linked to the Russian military. Trucks resembling those shown on Russia\u2019s state-run television as part of the convoy were lined up on what Mr. Lysenko called a military base. There was a glimpse of soldiers in uniform lined up in front of some trucks.\n\nValeriy Chaly, the deputy presidential chief of staff, said the Russian convoy would not be allowed to cross. Instead, the cargo would be unloaded, carted across the border, inspected by customs and then delivered using different trucks, he said.\n\nMany of the vehicles were draped in huge banners reading \u201chumanitarian aid\u201d in Russian, along with the double-headed eagle of Russia and its white, blue and red flag.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow either the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry or any other Russian law enforcement ministry to accompany the humanitarian cargo,\u201d Mr. Chaly said on Hromadske TV, calling the humanitarian mission a Ukrainian initiative with the Red Cross in charge of delivery. Any attempt to move the convoy into Ukraine without authorization would be viewed as an attack, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly said that Russia has massed 45,000 troops near the border, and that they are poised to attack. NATO\u2019s secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, expressed similar fears on Monday, saying there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d of a Russian invasion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Chaly also said outright that Ukraine had accepted the aid because of pressure from its Western allies.\n\nIn initially saying that Ukraine would accept the aid, the office of President Petro O. Poroshenko announced that President Obama had supported the move and offered American aid as well. Later, the Ukrainian president\u2019s office amended the statement to note that the United States had endorsed the plan but not offered aid.\n\nNot everyone agreed to acceptance.\n\nAt a morning session of Parliament, Oleh Lyashko, a nationalist politician who has helped form several paramilitary battalions, called for Ukraine to turn back the convoy and seal the border.\n\n\u201cHow can you take humanitarian aid from a country that destroys our country?\u201d Mr. Lyashko said. \u201cStop this nonsense.\u201d"}
