Though disappointed, those hard-line allies did not threaten to leave his alliance. The government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain had yet to offer an official response by late Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown today that we\u2019re willing to postpone any jump into the void,\u201d said Llu\u00eds Corominas, a lawmaker from Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s nationalist party. \u201cThose who voted for independence also needed to understand that certain conditions must be in place for it to become effective.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister has taken a hard line against the separatists, but strong reprisals against Mr. Puigdemont could galvanize the independence movement, particularly after the police crackdown on the day of the referendum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Rajoy, who has asked to appear before the Spanish Parliament on Wednesday, has a battery of emergency measures that he could use to stop Catalan secessionism in its tracks.\n\nThe Spanish Constitution allows Mr. Rajoy to suspend the regional Parliament and to take full administrative control over Catalonia, including the leadership of its autonomous police force and its public broadcaster.\n\nSpain\u2019s public prosecutors could also open criminal proceedings against Mr. Puigdemont and his government. On Monday, Pablo Casado, the spokesman for Mr. Rajoy\u2019s governing party, warned that Mr. Puigdemont could be imprisoned for insurrection.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Puigdemont (pronounced POOTCH-da-mon) used his speech to repeat his condemnations of police violence against Catalan voters during the referendum on Oct. 1, which had been declared illegal by Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court. About two-fifths of voters participated in the poll, but 90 percent of participants voted to secede, according to the Catalan authorities, a result that Mr. Puigdemont said gave the region a mandate for independence.\n\nDuring the referendum, \u201cthe Spanish state didn\u2019t just want to confiscate ballot boxes and ballot papers,\u201d Mr. Puigdemont said. \u201cThe main goal was to scare the people and force them to stay at home. But despite all these efforts, more than 2.2 million people voted because they overcame fear.\u201d\n\nMr. Puigdemont suggested that Madrid could still follow the example of the British government, which allowed Scotland\u2019s voters to reject independence in a referendum in 2014. \u201cAll we wanted was a Scottish-style referendum where both sides were able to put their views forward,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We have nothing against the Spaniards.\u201d\n\nAlbert Rivera, the leader of the Ciudadanos party, which is fiercely opposed to secession, told a news conference late on Tuesday that Mr. Puigdemont was trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d Madrid and urged Mr. Rajoy to use his emergency powers in response. He said Mr. Puigdemont had struck \u201ca blow against democracy\u201d \u2014 albeit a weakened one given the suspension of any unilateral declaration.\n\nMr. Rajoy has called a cabinet meeting for early Wednesday, before his appearance before Parliament. Xavier Garc\u00eda Albiol, the leader of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party in Catalonia, warned Mr. Puigdemont that his \u201cgame of semantic pirouettes is neither acceptable nor possible.\u201d He added: \u201cYou have talked on several occasions about dialogue and I say yes to dialogue but what do you want to talk about in concrete? Stealing national sovereignty?\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Albiol ended his intervention by predicting \u201cthere will be a day when we will all remember with shame these dark days when we split Catalan society in two.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLate Tuesday, Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda, Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister, said at a news briefing in Madrid that Mr. Puigdemont had made a speech worthy of \u201ca person who doesn\u2019t know where he stands, where he\u2019s going, nor with whom to go.\u201d She said separatists could not seek any mediation before returning to \u201clegality and democracy.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Puigdemont faced the near-impossible task of keeping unity among his fragile coalition of separatists, who have increasingly become strained over whether to provoke a head-on confrontation with Madrid that could leave Catalonia without any administrative autonomy.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnna Gabriel, a lawmaker from the Popular Unity Candidacy, a small, far-left party that played a pivotal role in putting Mr. Puigdemont in office, expressed her disappointment at not hearing a clear declaration of independence \u201cspoken to the world in different languages.\u201d She described Tuesday as a lost opportunity, but did not attack Mr. Puigdemont directly. \u201cThe only way to have negotiations with the Spanish state is by proclaiming the Catalan Republic,\u201d Ms. Gabriel added.\n\nAfter Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s address, \u201cthe people who are sad are the extremists on both sides,\u201d said Joan Maria Piqu\u00e9, a spokesman for Mr. Puigdemont. The majority, he added, should feel satisfied by the Catalan offer to negotiate because \u201cthey want a political solution to a political problem.\u201d\n\nOutside the Parliament building, huge crowds stood in anxious silence waiting for Mr. Puigdemont to say the magic words that would declare their independence from Spain.\n\nHe did not.\n\nA palpable disappointment rippled through the crowd, replete with whistles of displeasure and sighs of disappointment, when Mr. Puigdemont spoke of dialogue instead of immediate independence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so disappointed,\u201d said Jordi Valls, 54, who sat on a bench with his head down and a folded independence flag on his lap after the speech. \u201cI thought today he would declare independence, and tomorrow we would be independent, that we would have a new country and that other countries would start recognizing us.\u201d\n\nHe said that he had a bad feeling the moment he saw some hard-line allies of Mr. Puigdemont enter the chamber separately, but that the long speech gave him minutes of hope. But ultimately, he said, international pressure got to his leader.\n\nAs the thousands of supporters of independence, wrapped in their movement\u2019s flags and kicking empty beer cans in frustration, made for the exits, some older supporters held onto a shred of optimism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPedro Castell\u00f3, 77, from Lleida, in the hinterland of Catalonia, said he also was disappointed but expressed faith in the government that truly believed in independence. \u201cBecause what they think is best is best.\u201d Still, he warned, \u201cThis is the last try.\u201d"}
