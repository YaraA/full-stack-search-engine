Fistfights broke out, and there were some stabbings, as people tried to cut in line to get the precious documents from Greek officials that allowed them to take a ferry to Athens and beyond.\n\nRelief workers sent out pleas for help and resources. But smaller numbers of migrants arrived, largely because of the weather, and the adoption of a new system that divided the migrants into groups to apply for the necessary papers allowed officials in Lesbos to more easily send refugees on their way.\n\nThe landings fell to an average of 5,800 a day before creeping up to 6,200 per day in the last seven days. In all, 16,500 people were waiting in camps across the Greek islands on Wednesday for transport to the mainland. But the calm may be short-lived: a four-day strike by Greek ferry workers that began on Tuesday threatened once again to create bottlenecks and overwhelm relief workers who had only just begun to catch their breath.\n\nIn the meantime, with every break in the weather, rafts and dinghies continue to wash ashore.\n\nOn Saturday, 9,300 people landed on the Greek islands, when it was unseasonably balmy. On the next two days, when the north winds blew more fiercely, about half that number arrived. On Tuesday, once again, the seas calmed and boats appeared one after another pushing across the choppy strait.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe had no choice,\u201d said Nouri Mahmoud, 60, who once ran a small oil company in Syria. \u201cWe had to leave Aleppo. It has gotten much worse in recent weeks. The rebels are fighting each other, and now we have the Russians, too. Everyone is fighting everyone else. Whoever comes into Aleppo next is going to be slaughtering people.\u201d\n\nClustered around him in the doorway of a temporary shelter at a refugee center were his wife and his 15-year-old triplets.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go back now,\u201d Mr. Mahmoud said. \u201cWe have nothing to go back to.\u201d\n\nThat the crossing is getting more perilous \u2014 as it does every winter when the northern winds and the sinking temperatures churn and chill the sea \u2014 is beyond doubt.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

More than three dozen drowned.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd that was only the largest recent catastrophe. In one day this week, 11 people died when a boat capsized just 30 yards off the shore of Samos, another Greek island; two died off the shore of Rhodes, and six perished in the waters north of Lesbos.\n\n\u201cWe are confronted with these shipwrecks every day now,\u201d Ms. Morelli said.\n\nIn an outdoor coffeehouse one afternoon last week outside the main train station in Izmir, several dozen Syrian refugees sipped tea at rickety tables. Nearby shops sell life jackets, inner tubes and waterproof packets for cellphones and passports.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cOf course, we are aware that winter is coming, but it took us this long to sell all of our land and our house in Deir ez-Zor,\u201d said Ahmed Ali, 28, who was surrounded by a half-dozen family members. \u201cNow, with the Russians bombing in places, we think the situation will be even worse.\u201d\n\nHe is waiting, he said, to shop among the smuggling operations to try to divine which one he can trust.\n\n\u201cWhat choice do we have now but to move forward?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have nothing left at home to return to. Tell me, where else can we go?\u201d\n\nBy late Tuesday night, Mr. Ali said, the family had already reached Lesbos, taken a ferry to Athens, crossed through Macedonia and Serbia and was making its way across the Croatian border.\n\nA few yards away, at another tottering table, Adnan Sheikh Mohammad clicked shut his flip-phone and smiled broadly, clapping his cousin, Sami, on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cI have made a deal with a smuggler,\u201d he said. \u201cGod willing, we leave tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe price was $1,100 per adult, half that for the children, a sizable amount for a party of 12 adults and 10 children.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey plan to make their way to Sweden, where friends live, but they do not know the exact path they will follow.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are going to get off the boat in Athens and just follow the crowd,\u201d said Sami, 39, who had been a barber in Aleppo.\n\nThe next afternoon, volunteers waited at high points on Lesbos\u2019 shore and scanned the horizon.\n\nEvery now and then, small orange dots bobbing in the distance slowly clarified into a line of smaller orange dots. As they drew closer, they transformed, like apparitions, into a few dozen people in orange life vests, waving frantically.\n\nA volunteer clambered atop his car and began twirling a life vest over his head, signaling the boat to head to his left, away from a more treacherous stretch of shore. But the migrants did not see him or were unable to control the boat, and it crashed into the surf line on a jagged patch of stones.\n\nIt had clearly been a terrifying crossing. A half-dozen children wailed and clutched at their mothers, who were also weeping, the men looking about, trying to figure out what to do. Volunteers charged into the waves and tried to keep the boat perpendicular to the shore, but the force of the water was too strong and it flattened against the shoreline, threatening to upend.\n\nOne by one \u2014 children first, then women, then men \u2014 the passengers were unloaded and escorted the final few feet to shore. They looked around, dazed and tearful, but they all survived.\n\n\u201cAdi! Adi!\u201d a frantic mother screamed, spotting her son leaning against a nearby rock. She fell to the ground, pulled up the leg of his pants and began to kiss his shivering shin.", "summary": "The surge means that countries throughout the Balkans and Central Europe already under intense logistical and political strain will not find relief \u2014 especially Germany, the destination of choice for many of the refugees.Hopes that weather and diplomacy would ease the emergency are unfounded so far, putting more pressure on financially strapped and emotionally overwhelmed governments to quickly find more winterized shelter.The influx also underscores the European Union\u2019s failure to reach a unified solution to the crisis, leaving places like this, on the Greek island of Lesbos in the northern Aegean Sea off the coast of Turkey, struggling to deal with huge numbers of desperate people and raising questions about what will happen not just this winter, but in the spring and beyond.Last Wednesday, a boat carrying more than 250 migrants \u2014 a \u201cyacht,\u201d the Turkish smugglers call them, but they are usually old and creaky tubs \u2014 foundered in the stretch between Turkey and the north shore of Lesbos.In an outdoor coffeehouse one afternoon last week outside the main train station in Izmir, several dozen Syrian refugees sipped tea at rickety tables."}
