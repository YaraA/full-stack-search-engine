It was red, white, blue and black.\n\n\u201cI decided to wear it today because I am a Frenchman, and because people are dead,\u201d said Mr. Balet, a 57-year-old stylist, standing by rolls of fabric in the Dreyfus store at the March\u00e9 Saint-Pierre.\n\n\u201cAnd they died because they were innocent and they were young,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had nothing to do with anything; they were just out to have fun. And they were killed, one by one.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLike many old European cities, Paris has a history of violence, and each time, the city has absorbed it, and in some ways, even managed to forget it.\n\nParisians and tourists typically walk through the city\u2019s famous sites with little thought for the earlier carnage \u2014 the Protestants massacred at the Louvre on St. Bartholomew\u2019s Day in 1572, the aristocrats guillotined on the Place de la Concorde during the French Revolution, or the Tuileries palace burned during the Commune of 1871. Paris was spared during the Nazi occupation, but many of its citizens were not, with many of them commemorated on laconic plaques scattered through the city.\n\nBut the killings on Friday night came just 10 months after the massacre at Charlie Hebdo and the attack on a kosher grocery store, and seemed to many people here to be deliberately targeted at their way of life and their young people in particular, provoking fear and new concern about France\u2019s ability to manage the gulf between Muslims and non-Muslims here.\n\nOn Jan. 7, on the night of the killings at the editorial offices of Charlie Hebdo, thousands of Parisians spontaneously came out on the streets, bearing candles. Following the shooting later at the kosher grocery store, which resulted in more deaths, that mood of defiance and resilience grew until Jan. 11, when millions of people joined an official march of unity and solidarity in Paris.\n\nLatest Updates\n\nThis time, most people agree, the mood is different; the \u201cspirit of January 11th,\u201d so often cited by politicians, seems a distant memory. The city on Saturday was somber and subdued as people absorbed the news.\n\n\u201cLast time was the first time,\u201d said Jurgen Maillet, who ducked under a cafe awning for shelter from a slight drizzle. \u201cThis is the second time. It\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nMany stores \u2014 including the \u201cgrands magasins\u201d like Printemps and Galeries Lafayette \u2014 were shut; so were the museums, movie theaters and swimming pools, some with signs that said simply that the closings were because of \u201cevents.\u201d A popular park, the Buttes Chaumont in the north of Paris, closed midday because of what it referred to as \u201crumors.\u201d\n\nTraffic was slow and shoppers at the March\u00e9 Saint-Pierre were scarce, nothing like the usual Saturday crowds that come looking for discounts, mingling with the tourists heading up the hill to the Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt feels as though everything has come to a halt,\u201d said a sales clerk at another fabric store. \u201cLook, it\u2019s empty today. We would have stayed home if our boss would have let us, out of respect for those who died.\u201d\n\nThis time, the police cautioned against any mass gatherings and urged people to stay home. A Chinese restaurant near the Opera Garnier had to shoo customers away, after the police told them to shut down.\n\nThis time, as Mr. Balet noted, it seemed to be young people who were targeted, a fact that resonates with a generation that has no memory of past events. One retired couple said their children were more shocked than they were. \u201cWe remember the terrorist attacks in the 1990s,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, who was afraid to give her last name. \u201cOur children don\u2019t have any recollection of that.\u201d\n\nParis, with a population of 2.2 million inside the city limits, can feel very small at a time like this. Many young people have been to concerts like the one that was targeted at the Bataclan on Friday night. The neighborhood where the attacks took place is typically packed on weekends. That familiarity only brings the events closer to home.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Balet has a 24-year-old friend who was at the Bataclan concert, and emerged safe but \u201ctraumatized,\u201d he said. Another friend of his watched horrified from her window as people were gunned down in her street. Down the road, a woman at a minimarket said a friend of her son\u2019s had been wounded in the attacks, and was now between life and death at a nearby hospital.\n\n\u201cParisians are not very talkative,\u201d said Maxim Ferron, the 30-year-old manager of Love Organic, a trendy tea shop in the 9th arrondissement. \u201cThey keep things, their thoughts to themselves. But this time, the shock is greater: Charlie Hebdo was a target, a symbol. Yesterday, the victims weren\u2019t journalists, or famous. They were civilians.\u201d\n\nPeople talk about the need to show solidarity but they worry that the scale of the massacre will only divide society even further.\n\nSome people of immigrant background, who declined to give their names, worry that people will conflate France\u2019s large Muslim population with radical Islam.\n\nMr. Balet is not sure that solidarity was the reason so many stores and restaurants stayed shut today. \u201cI think it is fear,\u201d he said.", "summary": "\u201cI decided to wear it today because I am a Frenchman, and because people are dead,\u201d said Mr. Balet, a 57-year-old stylist, standing by rolls of fabric in the Dreyfus store at the March\u00e9 Saint-Pierre.
