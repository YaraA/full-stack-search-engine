They will extend beyond the Vatican to much of the city.\n\nTwo thousand officers will patrol the streets every day, checking areas where pilgrims and tourists congregate, but also the capital\u2019s sprawling suburbs. Roman neighborhoods where night life thrives will be monitored, as will the Olympic stadium when matches are played.\n\nControls will be strengthened at the airports and bus depots serving the city and at Civitavecchia Port, about an hour away, where cruise ships dock. The police will make spot checks on buses and subway cars. Video surveillance will be increased downtown and around major basilicas, which pilgrims visit during the Holy Year.\n\nAnd reinforcements will be on call when huge crowds are expected, like in February for the transfer to Rome of the mortal remains of Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, a popular saint. Starting Dec. 8, the skies over Rome will become a no-fly zone; drone aircraft have also been banned.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t underestimate anything,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Angelo said of the controls, included in a 220-page plan that draws from Italy\u2019s experience defeating domestic terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\u201cWe developed this plan over time, because the terrorism alarm didn\u2019t start yesterday,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Angelo added.\n\nStill, the doubts are such that spontaneous protests have surged on social media to halt the Jubilee, which many here see as an unnecessary risk in risky times. But appeals to the Vatican under the hashtags #nogiubileo and #stopgiubileo, as well as impromptu demonstrations, have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThrough various prelates, including the Vatican\u2019s chief spokesman, the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church have vowed that the Jubilee will go on.\n\n\u201cWe have all the reasons to think that there is a total guarantee with regards to the safety of the pilgrims that will come to Rome, but that, obviously, it is necessary to adopt the appropriate measures, as is the case throughout the world,\u201d said Archbishop Rino Fisichella, the Vatican official whose office is responsible for the Jubilee. \u201cI don\u2019t see why the situation in Rome has to be overdramatized.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ticket booths will also be moved to improve access to the Colosseum, the most visited monument in Italy.\n\n\u201cWe want to have few places of mass congregation, not only because they could be possible targets, but also, we\u2019re concerned about potential panic,\u201d a spokesman for the site said.\n\nMonuments that are already monitored \u2014 like the Great Synagogue of Rome, which was attacked by Palestinian militants on Oct. 9, 1982, killing a 2-year-old boy and wounding more than three dozen people \u2014 will get heightened attention.\n\nSecurity was tightened in Rome\u2019s Jewish neighborhood in mid-November after an Orthodox Jewish man was stabbed on a street in Milan, an attack that remains unsolved.\n\nPatrols now move more frequently through the \u201cghetto,\u201d as the area is known, and armed police officers are more visible. \u201cParadoxically, nowadays a restaurant on Via Portico d\u2019Ottavia is one of the most secure places in Rome,\u201d Fabio Perugia, the spokesman for the Jewish Community of Rome, said of a restaurant-lined street there.\n\nIn recent weeks, the police have been bombarded with calls and alerts \u2014 false alarms \u2014 regarding abandoned knapsacks or luggage, prompting temporary shutdowns of the subway system on numerous occasions. To allay fraught nerves, Italian officials have played down the potential of an attack and played up the country\u2019s ability to handle emergencies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe government perceived that a sense of panic was spreading,\u201d Germano Dottori, a lecturer of strategic studies at Rome\u2019s Luiss Guido Carli University, said of the frequent news reports on the government\u2019s strategies.\n\nYet Mr. Dottori likes to cite an episode that made only moderate waves in the Italian news media when it happened, yet shows how easily security can be breached.\n\nLast December, a month after the pope visited Turkey, Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish terrorist who tried to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981, entered Italy without the required visa and reached St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, a camera crew in tow, to lay flowers at the tomb of the pope, who died in 2005.\n\nSecurity forces in the square stopped Mr. Agca, but he was allowed to enter the basilica and place white roses on the tomb. The Italian police then detained him, and he was later expelled from the country.\n\n\u201cI think he was delivering a message that still has to be deciphered,\u201d Mr. Dottori said, positing two explanations. The visit could have been a direct threat to the Vatican, he said, or could have a less overt interpretation: \u201cYou are in danger, and your security is not tight at all.\u201d", "summary": "Rome\u2019s police chief, Nicol\u00f2 D\u2019Angelo, said at a news conference in November that the tighter security measures were a response to a \u201cJubilee in the time of ISIS,\u201d as the Islamic State militant group is known. \u201cWe have all the reasons to think that there is a total guarantee with regards to the safety of the pilgrims that will come to Rome, but that, obviously, it is necessary to adopt the appropriate measures, as is the case throughout the world,\u201d said Archbishop Rino Fisichella, the Vatican official whose office is responsible for the Jubilee.
