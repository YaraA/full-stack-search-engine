He was arrested in February, only to be released for lack of evidence. After Thursday\u2019s attack, the police found kitchen knives, a gun and a Quran in the trunk of the car he was driving, and also pieces of paper with scribbled allegiances to the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nMs. Le Pen pounced, mocking the departing president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and vowing to be an unblinkingly tough leader.\n\nFrance\u2019s Vote: The Basics The presidential election will be held in two stages.\n\n\u201cFor 10 years, under the governments of left and right, everything has been done to make us losers,\u201d she said, speaking from her party headquarters outside Paris on Friday. \u201cThere must be a president who acts and who protects.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Le Pen was not the only one who stood to gain. Some analysts predicted that the principal electoral beneficiary could be the embattled mainstream center-right candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who produced a book last fall called \u201cDefeating Islamic Totalitarianism,\u201d and who also uses harsh rhetoric to depict the antiterrorism fight as a war of civilizations.\n\nMr. Fillon, a former prime minister, and once the presidential front-runner, had languished in polls after becoming entangled in a nepotism scandal that led to embezzlement charges against him. But he has been gaining ground in recent weeks, and the attack might provide a final push.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine a movement toward one who has held power,\u201d said Dominique Reyni\u00e9, an expert on the far right who teaches at Sciences Po. \u201cHe\u2019s written on terrorism. He\u2019s been prime minister.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Marine Le Pen, it won\u2019t have an effect,\u201d Mr. Reyni\u00e9 said. \u201cShe\u2019s already at the level she\u2019s reached, partly because of terrorism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThroughout Friday, the authorities in Paris continued their investigation as more details became known about Mr. Cheurfi, who was killed by the police on Thursday. He had been convicted of crimes four times and spent more than 10 years in prison, most of that time for shooting at police officers during a 2001 robbery, the Paris prosecutor, Fran\u00e7ois Molins, acknowledged at a Friday afternoon news conference.\n\nMr. Cheurfi\u2019s arrest in February was for making anti-police threats, but the authorities lacked sufficient proof to hold him. Asked about his release, Christophe Rouget, a spokesman for one of the main police unions, said, \u201cWe live in a state of laws, after all,\u201d citing the lack of probative evidence against him.\n\nVideo\n\nEven so, the police made Mr. Cheurfi the subject of a preliminary terrorism investigation, Mr. Molins said.\n\n\u201cCheurfi\u2019s criminal record, his trajectory, justified the pursuit of investigations by the antiterrorism branch of my office, within a terrorism context,\u201d he added.\n\nA man identified by BFM-TV as Mr. Cheurfi\u2019s lawyer described him as \u201cextremely isolated, a solitary person,\u201d who spent much of his time playing video games. \u201cHis development had been blocked,\u201d said the lawyer, Jean-Laurent Panier. \u201cHis father and brother were worried about him.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Mr. Cheurfi\u2019s neighbors in the Paris suburb of Chelles described him as quiet, and showing no obvious signs of radicalization. \u201cNot very friendly. Fairly proud,\u201d said Augusto Rodriguez, a neighbor.\n\nMr. Cheurfi was not among France\u2019s notorious \u201cS-Files,\u201d the thousands suspected of extremism whom the state is officially surveilling, but does not have enough formal proof to arrest. The S-Files have acquired near-mythic boogeyman status in the French imagination. On Friday, Ms. Le Pen called for their expulsion from the country. At a campaign rally in Marseille earlier in the week, she called them an \u201cimmense army of the shadows that wants us to live in terror.\u201d\n\nEmboldened after the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es attack, Ms. Le Pen sought, as she often does, to place the antiterrorism fight as a struggle for the French soul. The idea is at the heart of her nationalistic campaign, and even as her momentum has slowed she has still placed first in many polls before the Sunday vote. \u201cFrance is targeted not for what it does, but for what it is, and the French, for the simple reason that they are French,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe French government immediately reacted harshly to Ms. Le Pen\u2019s demands \u2014 a measure of how seriously it took the potential boost of Thursday night\u2019s shooting to a party it views as a threat to French democracy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

At least,\u201d said Christophe Pohls, a barman at a cafe on the Rue de Ponthieu.\n\n\u201cWhen you see what\u2019s going these days, sure, sure, this helps her. She wants to close the frontiers. Pay more attention to what\u2019s going on in France,\u201d said Mr. Pohls, who approved of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s idea of expelling those named the S-Files.\n\nHis friend Henri Martins, in charge of security at a local nightclub, agreed. \u201cDefinitely a happy coincidence for her,\u201d he said, as he vented against what he described as the porousness of the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cThey arrest these guys 10 times, then they let them out?\u201d asked Mr. Martins, an ex-policeman. \u201cCome on. For sure, this is going to pull up her score.\u201d\n\nThe attack occurred on Thursday night, and on Friday morning people in the neighborhood were still recovering.\n\n\u201cHallucinatory. First, three shots, then four. We were in the middle of cooking, and we had to stop,\u201d said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Desloovere, a cook at La Casita on the Rue Washington, just around the corner. \u201cThe minute you saw people running, you knew what was up.\u201d He recalled looking down the normally packed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es \u201cand it was totally empty,\u201d with pedestrians pressing themselves against storefronts, \u201clike flies stuck against the glass.\u201d\n\nAt Le Carpaccio, on the Rue de Berri, customers heard the bursts of gunfire, saw people running in panic down the busy street, and dived to the ground. \u201cThey went down on the ground, and broke all the glasses,\u201d said Jamila Maachaoui, who was sweeping up the shards on Friday morning.", "summary": "Some analysts predicted that the principal electoral beneficiary could be the embattled mainstream center-right candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who produced a book last fall called \u201cDefeating Islamic Totalitarianism,\u201d and who also uses harsh rhetoric to depict the antiterrorism fight as a war of civilizations.Asked about his release, Christophe Rouget, a spokesman for one of the main police unions, said, \u201cWe live in a state of laws, after all,\u201d citing the lack of probative evidence against him.The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Mr. Cheurfi\u2019s neighbors in the Paris suburb of Chelles described him as quiet, and showing no obvious signs of radicalization.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.At Le Carpaccio, on the Rue de Berri, customers heard the bursts of gunfire, saw people running in panic down the busy street, and dived to the ground."}
