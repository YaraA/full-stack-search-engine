He earned nearly 2.9 million euros ($3.1 million) in those years, according to the financial disclosure form from when he was economy minister.\n\nBy 2014, at 36, he was appointed minister of economy under France\u2019s current Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, before leaving to begin his campaign. His one significant achievement was passage of what became known as the Macron Law, a hodgepodge of economic policies mostly designed to cut red tape and make markets more flexible.\n\nThose who have worked closely with Mr. Macron, both in government and in the private sector, are almost uniformly impressed by his grasp and dedication, but some said that at times they felt misled as Mr. Macron pursued his ambitions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But when Mr. Vercamer later brought them up in debate on the legislation, Mr. Macron turned down every one, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it was dishonest because that\u2019s not the right term,\u201d said Mr. Vercamer, who was a vice president of the committee that examined the bill. \u201cBut for someone who comes to a private meeting and says, \u2018This is good,\u2019 and then comes to a public meeting and doesn\u2019t support you and doesn\u2019t give a reason, that\u2019s not worthy of a representative of the Republic.\u201d\n\nThe idea of what Mr. Macron represents as a candidate \u2014 a novel amalgam of pro-business and pro-social welfare policies, with an optimistic outlook on France\u2019s future \u2014 often seems to inspire more than Mr. Macron himself.\n\nAt his recent rally in Pau, the crowd seemed a bit more enthusiastic before he spoke than afterward when some seemed baffled by his lofty proposals. He has been criticized as being technocratic, abstract and sometimes lacking in empathy.\n\nPhoto\n\nAn episode last year during a visit to an event in southern France, when Mr. Macron was heckled by a 21-year-old union activist in a black T-shirt, seems emblematic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe young man called out to the neatly attired former banker, saying he had \u201cnot a penny to pay for a suit like that one.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron responded: \u201cThe best way to pay for a suit is to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked since the age of 16,\u201d the man shot back, in an exchange popularly interpreted as having put Mr. Macron in his place.\n\nMr. Macron\u2019s policy proposals, while numerous, have been assailed as vague and hard to define politically, particularly for a country that thinks in terms of the political left and right. But to others, that is his appeal.\n\nJacques Attali, an economist, writer and longtime adviser to French politicians, said that many of Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas were forged working on a prestigious nonpartisan economic commission set up under the right-leaning President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind the commission was to do something that should have been done by either the left or the right, or by both, but that had not been done by anyone,\u201d said Mr. Attali, who served as the commission\u2019s chairman.\n\nThat embrace of bipartisanship can result in neither side trusting him.\n\n\u201cIn a way, the left doesn\u2019t really believe in him; in a way, the right doesn\u2019t really believe in him,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel, a well-known writer on politics and culture, who also hosts a popular radio program on France Culture.\n\nYet there are many people who do, particularly among the urban, educated and relatively young.\n\n\u201cHe has a kind of free spirit that one can see in the choices he\u2019s made,\u201d said Am\u00e9lie Castera, a longtime friend of Mr. Macron\u2019s who studied with him at the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration and now holds a senior position at AXA, the French insurance giant.\n\n\u201cHe has this freedom that comes from his confidence in his destiny,\u201d she said.", "summary": "His one significant achievement was passage of what became known as the Macron Law, a hodgepodge of economic policies mostly designed to cut red tape and make markets more flexible.Francis Vercamer, a member of the center-right Union of Democrats and Independents, remembers proposing several amendments to the Macron Law in private and said that the economy minister spoke positively about them.An episode last year during a visit to an event in southern France, when Mr. Macron was heckled by a 21-year-old union activist in a black T-shirt, seems emblematic.Jacques Attali, an economist, writer and longtime adviser to French politicians, said that many of Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas were forged working on a prestigious nonpartisan economic commission set up under the right-leaning President Nicolas Sarkozy.\u201cHe has a kind of free spirit that one can see in the choices he\u2019s made,\u201d said Am\u00e9lie Castera, a longtime friend of Mr. Macron\u2019s who studied with him at the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration and now holds a senior position at AXA, the French insurance giant."}
