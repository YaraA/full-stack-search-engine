The populist party increased its share of the vote to roughly 39 percent from about 3 percent in the last general election, in 2010.\n\nAcross Europe, populist parties have been making gains, and the Conservatives are concerned that the U.K. Independence Party could skim off enough votes in next year\u2019s general election to deprive them of victory.\n\n\u201cThis is very significant because this is UKIP\u2019s first elected member of Parliament in its 21-year history,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Nottingham. \u201cIt may well encourage other defections among members of the radical right-wing flank of the Conservative Party.\u201d\n\nBefore the result, the U.K. Independence Party\u2019s leader, Nigel Farage, told The Daily Telegraph that victory in Clacton-on-Sea would shift the tectonic plates of politics, while a victory in both seats would be a \u201cKrakatoa moment.\u201d\n\nBecause Britain\u2019s electoral system puts smaller parties at a disadvantage, the U.K. Independence Party is unlikely to win a significant number of seats in next year\u2019s general election, but it could secure enough to influence the outcome.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His article created a furor, in part because he went on to say, \u201cOnly in Asmara after Eritrea\u2019s bloody war have I encountered a greater proportion of citizens on crutches or in wheelchairs.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday as he knocked on doors alone in the driving rain, Mr. Carswell said he believed that the mainstream parties were out of touch. Voters \u2014 or, as he puts it, \u201cthe customers\u201d \u2014 are \u201cgetting a bum deal from the political system right across the country \u2014 that\u2019s felt particularly strongly here.\u201d When one voter appealed to him, he promised to take up her complaints about street lighting and policing.\n\nMr. Carswell described the article by Mr. Parris as \u201csneering, condescending, obnoxious and very sad,\u201d and rejected the idea that voters here felt left behind.\n\nBut some disagree. Since the 1960s, Clacton-on-Sea, once a popular resort, has struggled to adapt to a decline in tourism as vacationers head abroad to affordable beaches in the sun. To the annoyance of some residents, vacant accommodation is now used to house people on welfare or recently released from prison.\n\nWhile parts of the constituency are affluent, the suburb of Jaywick, which has many simple, one-story beachside homes, placed at the top in one 2010 ranking of the country\u2019s most deprived neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cPeople around here believe that Jaywick has been forgotten and that the government does not support it,\u201d said Andrew McGeever, manager of the local pharmacy.\n\nThere was high demand for medication to treat diabetes and lung diseases, he said. Health problems were often caused by \u201cpoor lifestyle, heavy use of drink or drugs,\u201d added Mr. McGeever, 32, who said he planned to vote Conservative. \u201cPeople are disillusioned here, and a high proportion don\u2019t vote because they feel it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d"}
