At a separate news conference in which he faced reporters alone, he reiterated the theme of his article, that Europe was at risk of being \u201coverrun\u201d and had to shut its borders. The Hungarian prime minister argued that European countries had no obligation to accept most of the migrants, as \u201cthe overwhelming majority of people are not refugees because they are not coming from a war-stricken area.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Christian obligation is not to create illusions,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Orban went on to invoke Hungary\u2019s historical experience as part of the Ottoman Empire, which ended more than three centuries ago, as an explanation for its current opposition to Muslim immigrants.\n\n\u201cDuring my meeting today with President Tusk we also discussed history; we talked about our own experiences,\u201d Mr. Orban said. \u201cI have to say that when it comes to living together with Muslim communities, we are the only ones who have experience because we had the possibility to go through that experience for 150 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolish people for example suffered from Christian people \u2013 not to name names,\u201d he added, in what appeared to be a reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nViewed from Hungary, Mr. Orban continued, the experience of multicultural living in Western Europe did not look appealing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to criticize France, Belgium, any other country,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe think all countries have a right to decide whether they want to have a large number of Muslims in their countries. If they want to live together with them, they can. We don\u2019t want to and I think we have a right to decide that we do not want a large number of Muslim people in our country. We do not like the consequences of having a large number of Muslim communities that we see in other countries, and I do not see any reason for anyone else to force us to create ways of living together in Hungary that we do not want to see.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Orban\u2019s formulation echoed notorious remarks made by the poet T.S. Eliot in 1933, another moment in history when Europeans expressed fears of being overwhelmed by a \u201cflood\u201d of non-Christian immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe population should be homogeneous; where two or more cultures exist in the same place they are likely either to be fiercely self-conscious or both to become adulterate,\u201d Mr. Eliot said in a lecture at the University of Virginia. \u201cWhat is still more important is unity of religious background; and reasons of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable.\u201d\n\nThere was quite a lot of condemnation on social networks for Mr. Orban\u2019s frank remarks, but also some praise from nationalists and anti-Muslim bloggers."}
