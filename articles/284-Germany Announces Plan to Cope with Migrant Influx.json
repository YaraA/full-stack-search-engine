Hungary, a nation of about 10 million people, is building a fence to try to prevent the arrivals from crossing into its territory.\n\nIf Europe does not act to share the burden more evenly, Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said, then it might prove necessary to close borders opened by the Schengen Agreement, which allows free movement without border controls across much of the European Union.\n\nHe insisted that the recent increase in arrivals was unforeseen. Germany will take note of the swelling tide of arrivals by registering the numbers of all who come, and not just those who submit an asylum application.\n\nFigures for July illustrated his point: hours earlier, the Interior Ministry said about 39,000 people applied for asylum last month. By contrast, he told reporters, 83,000 people arrived in Germany in July seeking asylum or status as refugees. Figures for August have already topped 50,000, he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

He plans to meet his French counterpart on Thursday in Berlin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Tuesday, Die Welt published an interview with Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, in which he said the refugee burden in Europe should land on more shoulders.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, Germany cannot take 40 percent and bear this burden,\u201d Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said. \u201cWe need short-, medium- and long-term solutions.\u201d\n\nAbove all, he said, goals must be defined. \u201cWe cannot simultaneously want that everyone is allowed to come and at the same time want to reduce the numbers of those who do come,\u201d he said. \u201cThat won\u2019t work. That means that, guided by these forecasts, we need a discussion here in Germany. And that is really necessary.\u201d", "summary": "According to figures through June from Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics office, Hungary has registered 32,800 refugees this year, Italy 15,200, France 14,800, Sweden 11,400, Austria 9,700 and Britain 7,300.The figures for Hungary suggest that migrants who go from Turkey to Greece are then making their way through the Balkans toward the richer nations of the European Union.Noting that the refugee crisis \u201cis a challenge for us all,\u201d the minister also stressed that anyone who arrived in Germany seeking help had the right \u201cto be welcomed and accommodated in a worthy, secure and decent fashion.\u201d\u201cEveryone has the right to a fair process\u201d in judging their future, he said, condemning the 202 attacks registered on asylum shelters and refugees this year as unworthy of Germany.Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said he had not only reorganized Germany\u2019s bureaucracy to coordinate better between the federal, state and local authorities but also would work with European colleagues."}
