She would find her job that much tougher if Greece deteriorates further into humanitarian and political crisis.\n\nWith Mrs. Merkel angered by decisions in Austria and nine other countries to tighten their borders, trapping tens of thousands of migrants in Greece, \u201cthis creates an opportunity for a closer alliance between Athens and Berlin,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the head of European analysis at the Eurasia Group in London. The refugee crisis \u201ccould win Greece some bailout flexibility,\u201d he said.\n\nSome members of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s fragile coalition government have also hinted they would like creditors to reduce some of Greece\u2019s debt in exchange for Greece bearing the burden of warehousing the migrants Europe will not allow in.\n\nThere is little outward sign that European leaders are willing to link the two issues and let up on requirements in last summer\u2019s bailout plan for deep budget cuts and painful overhauls of many elements of the economy. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, warned on Thursday in a speech at the London School of Economics that the refugee crisis did not mean Greece could relax its fiscal efforts.\n\n\u201cOf course, there is a new situation, the refugee crisis, and therefore Greece needs beyond all discussion additional solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis does not mean that Greece should not continue to work to regain competitiveness.\u201d\n\nYet, with dramatic scenes of thousands of migrants piled up at Greece\u2019s northern border, enduring tear gas and increasingly unsanitary conditions, European officials moved with unusual speed this week to promise 700 million euros, about $770 million, in humanitarian assistance over the next three years, most of it for Greece. And they are intensifying their efforts to bottle up more of the migrants in Turkey, before they can reach Greece, with hopes of relocating those who qualify for asylum directly to the heart of Europe.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Greece\u2019s overall unemployment rate has been stuck above 25 percent for more than two years, while the number of young people without jobs remains near 50 percent.\n\nMr. Tsipras\u2019s biggest immediate challenge is to complete an overhaul of the near-bankrupt pension system, without which Greece cannot move forward in talks with creditors on sorely needed debt relief. The pressure from creditors has sparked raucous street protests in recent weeks. The creditors have also delayed disbursing billions of euros in new bailout funds, citing slow progress by Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government in implementing the austerity measures.\n\nThroughout last year, the government had effectively waved through migrants \u2014 almost none of whom wanted to stay in the economically moribund country \u2014 to Germany and other prosperous nations where they wanted asylum. But when the nations along the migrant trail decided to constrain the flow of people, the rest of Europe warned Greece that it could be kicked out of the Schengen system of passport-free travel if it did not exercise control over its borders.\n\nFaced with an ultimatum, Mr. Tsipras has moved to get new migrant registration centers operating on the islands and ordered the construction of refugee camps around Athens and elsewhere.\n\nAt the same time, he has hardened his position with Europe, demanding this week that the European Union \u201cexplicitly recognize that Greece cannot assume all the responsibility by itself,\u201d and demanding sanctions for countries that do not take their share of refugees under a Europe-wide relocation plan that has so far been a flop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge for Tsipras because the nature of the crisis is changing, and rather than seeing refugees and migrants simply pass through, we\u2019re now talking about having to find places to house them,\u201d said Nick Malkoutzis, the editor of MacroPolis, a political analysis website.\n\n\u201cThe one thing he can\u2019t let happen is for migrants and refugees to be left out in the open, where they become not only vulnerable to extremists, but turn into a focal point for the far right to try and rally support,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a peculiar reversal, analysts say, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s greatest hope may lie with Mrs. Merkel, who has steadfastly admonished other countries not to let Greece \u201cplunge into chaos,\u201d and rebuked Austria and the nine Balkan states that shut their borders.\n\n\u201cDo you seriously believe that all the euro states that last year fought all the way to keep Greece in the eurozone \u2014 and we were the strictest \u2014 can one year later allow Greece to, in a way, plunge into chaos?\u201d she said in a weekend interview with the public broadcaster ARD.\n\nYet on the streets of Athens, few are buying talk of European solidarity.\n\n\u201cThis just shows you how not-united Europe is,\u201d said Jackie Rogers, a Briton who has lived in Greece for nearly 40 years, sweeping her eyes over migrants scrambling for donated food, water and clothing at Victoria Square in central Athens.\n\n\u201cI think it suits northern European nations who don\u2019t want the problem in their backyard to use Greece as a dumping ground.\u201d", "summary": "With Mrs. Merkel angered by decisions in Austria and nine other countries to tighten their borders, trapping tens of thousands of migrants in Greece, \u201cthis creates an opportunity for a closer alliance between Athens and Berlin,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the head of European analysis at the Eurasia Group in London. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge for Tsipras because the nature of the crisis is changing, and rather than seeing refugees and migrants simply pass through, we\u2019re now talking about having to find places to house them,\u201d said Nick Malkoutzis, the editor of MacroPolis, a political analysis website.
