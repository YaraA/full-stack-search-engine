Milov, a former deputy energy minister and now political opposition leader who has written several reports alleging corruption. \u201cCertain personal close friends of Putin who were people of relatively moderate means before Putin came to power all of a sudden turned out to be billionaires.\u201d\n\nMr. Putin has repeatedly denied any involvement in the enrichment of these and other acquaintances, and he has forcefully dismissed assertions made by his political opponents that he himself is a secret beneficiary of these enterprises and has amassed tens of billions of dollars in bank accounts outside Russia.\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s spokesman has also denied any connection to a sprawling resort complex that some of Mr. Putin\u2019s St. Petersburg acquaintances were said to be building for him as a \u201cpalace\u201d on the Black Sea at a cost of as much as $1 billion.\n\nOne of Mr. Putin\u2019s former associates from St. Petersburg, Sergei Kolesnikov, recently fled Russia with a trove of documents that appear to support the connection to the resort. In meetings with Russian and Western journalists, Mr. Kolesnikov has described other business dealings in which money was funneled, often as loans , to businesses controlled by Mr. Putin\u2019s friends or relatives.\n\nThe denials from Mr. Putin\u2019s acquaintances are just as steadfast. Mr. Timchenko partly won a lawsuit against Mr. Milov in which he insisted that he was not a \u201cfriend\u201d of Mr. Putin\u2019s. In a statement this week, a spokesman for Mr. Timchenko, Anton Kurevin, acknowledged that Mr. Putin and Mr. Timchenko met in the early 1990s in St. Petersburg, but said that Mr. Putin had no connection to Mr. Timchenko\u2019s business. Instead, they still have ties to a judo club where Mr. Putin sparred as a young man with Mr. Rotenberg.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAs has been stated on numerous previous occasions, it is true that Mr. Timchenko does know Mr. Putin,\u201d Mr. Kurevin said. \u201cHowever, the relationship is one of casual acquaintanceship and not close friendship.\u201d\n\nMr. Rotenberg declined to respond to written questions. Mr. Kovalchuk, reached through a publicity agent representing his bank, by Thursday evening also had not replied to a written request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLegalities aside, these relationships are fixed in the public mind and widely reported by the Russian news media, so how Mr. Putin handles them could prove critical both to his near-term political survival and his legacy.\n\n\u201cDid they just come and say, \u2018Hello, we are your friends\u2019? I don\u2019t know, I was not present at these conversations,\u201d said Yevgeny G. Yasin, a former minister of economy and now professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow . \u201cBut facts are facts. They were close, they had warm relations. And now they are wealthy.\u201d\n\nThe dealings of Mr. Putin and his acquaintances are likely to come under even more scrutiny as the opposition grows bolder in clamoring for government reforms. Raising the stakes further, a new land rush of privatization in Russia is about to begin. To balance its budget, the government intends to transfer $50 billion in assets to the private sector over the next five years. If those assets end up in the same wealthy, well-connected hands, Mr. Putin could find himself struggling to maintain the legitimacy needed to serve out his term.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Putin will be under pressure to repay the loyalty of his associates, who might reasonably want assurances that they will not face prosecution or exile, as has happened in the past to a half-dozen or so members of the first generation of so-called oligarchs in post-Soviet Russia. \u201cThe future for them without Putin is quite a bit more questionable and less promising,\u201d said Mikhail Dmitriev, an economist at the Center for Strategic Research in Moscow.\n\nOn paper, Mr. Putin shows no connection to big riches. In a disclosure required by the electoral authorities, he declared an average annual income of about $153,000 over the last four years from a salary, military pension, investments and bank interest. His wife earned about $1,200 a year on bank deposits. He also declared owning a third of an acre of land near Moscow, an 800-square-foot apartment and a garage in St. Petersburg, as well as three vehicles \u2014 two 1960s antiques and a 2009 Lada \u2014 and a tow-hitch trailer. Mr. Putin and his wife declared slightly less than $500,000 in bank savings.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But much is now public, owing to disclosure rules on Western stock exchanges, due diligence by foreign companies, lawsuits and a newfound aggressiveness in the Russian opposition news media.\n\nRosneft now sells a significant portion of its oil through Mr. Timchenko\u2019s privately held, Netherlands -based trading company, called Gunvor. The company acknowledges controlling about a fifth of Russia\u2019s crude oil exports, meaning the proceeds from roughly 5 percent of Russia\u2019s total economic output are channeled through Mr. Timchenko\u2019s trading operation.\n\nShares in Rosneft itself are scheduled to be sold later this year as part of the new privatization wave.\n\nIn cables released by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks , American diplomats described Gunvor as of \u201cspecial note\u201d in a broader system of opaque dealings during the oil boom. The company, a 2009 cable said, is \u201crumored to be one of Putin\u2019s sources of undisclosed wealth.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a statement, Gunvor rebutted the assertion in the diplomatic cable, saying that Mr. Putin \u201cis not a beneficiary of this company or its activities.\u201d The statement noted that the oil business soared worldwide during Mr. Putin\u2019s time in office, and that Gunvor\u2019s success was part of the wider boom.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kovalchuk, the chairman of the formerly tiny St. Petersburg bank that now controls Gazprom subsidiaries, including the energy behemoth\u2019s pension fund, was a neighbor of Mr. Putin\u2019s at his lakeside summer home outside St. Petersburg.\n\nIn a 2010 annual report, the bank, Bank Rossiya , listed Mr. Kovalchuk as owner of just over 30 percent of the shares, worth about $1.5 billion. Mr. Timchenko also owns a stake in Bank Rossiya, and some of Mr. Putin\u2019s relatives work for the Gazprom spinoffs. According to Mr. Kolesnikov, Bank Rossiya is at the center of the financing for the Black Sea palace.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Timchenko said his main connection to Mr. Putin was through a judo club in St. Petersburg, called Yavara-Neva, where as a young man the future president sparred with Mr. Rotenberg and his brother Boris Rotenberg.\n\nToday, the Rotenbergs hold interests in a contractor selling pipe to Gazprom, as well as vodka distilleries, a developer of malls outside Moscow, mines and ports. In 2010, Russia\u2019s antimonopoly agency reported Gazprom bought 93 percent of its pipe from Arkady Rotenberg\u2019s company, North European Pipe Project.\n\nLast year Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at $1.1 billion and his brother\u2019s at $550 million.\n\nThe lines between legitimate and illegitimate businesses are often fuzzy in Russia. In some cases, critics say that Mr. Putin\u2019s associates completed deals without the required competitive bidding, and in others obtained properties at hugely discounted prices. But it was not clear that any laws were violated.\n\nEarly in his career, Mr. Putin was philosophically opposed to transferring control of natural resources to private hands; with the help of the rector of one of St. Petersburg\u2019s prestigious universities, the Mining Institute, he prepared a graduate dissertation that proposed increasing state control. And in his first years in power, he pursued that approach, retaking Yukos Oil, for instance, which was mostly absorbed into Rosneft.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe rector, Vladimir V. Litvinenko, said this approach was needed after the mismanaged privatizations of the 1990s, but no longer, and that Mr. Putin now believed in the efficiency and benefits of private ownership.\n\nMr. Litvinenko has enjoyed some of those benefits himself.\n\nA phosphate mine in the Arctic that had been partly owned by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky , the now-jailed Yukos owner, later became the core asset of Phosagro, a company that went public on the London Stock Exchange last July.\n\nIn a prospectus, Mr. Litvinenko is listed among its new owners, holding 5 percent of the shares, worth about $260 million. Mr. Litvinenko, who today is heading Mr. Putin\u2019s election campaign in St. Petersburg, said he was paid in shares for consulting work in 2004, and that this \u201cdid not contradict any laws.\u201d\n\nHe also expressed deep reservations about the protest movement.\n\n\u201cIf government is changed not by evolutionary methods, but revolutionary methods, this is a catastrophe,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Putin \u201cis the only choice. Of the other candidates, I don\u2019t see anybody who could lead Russia. And I don\u2019t just fear the street. I horribly fear the street. I have lived a lot. But this period is fearful for me.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cThe basic point is that these guys have benefited and made their fortunes through deals which involved state-controlled companies, which were operating under the direct control of government and the president,\u201d said Vladimir S.
