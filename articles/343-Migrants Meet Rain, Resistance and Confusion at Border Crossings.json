{"title": "Migrants Meet Rain, Resistance and Confusion at Border Crossings", "authors": ["Palko Karasz", "Dan Bilefsky"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/world/europe/migrant-crisis-hungary.html", "body": "Denmark, which had temporarily closed a highway running north from the German border to try to contain migrants seeking to travel to Sweden and other countries, said on Thursday that it would not impede their progress. The about-face highlighted confusion over how to apply European Union rules, which require migrants to register or seek asylum in the country of their arrival. Denmark has recently lowered benefits to migrants, and many of those traveling through the country do not want to remain there.\n\nAmong the toughest responses to the crisis has been Hungary\u2019s, where the army on Thursday conducted exercises near the Serbian border, which could be preparation for a more active role as thousands continued to pour into the country overnight.\n\nThe involvement of the army in policing the border, where a 110-mile fence with razor wire was being built to keep migrants out, is subject to the approval of Parliament this month.\n\nThe number of migrants in the area has shown no sign of abating, and Hungarian military officials have said the army will help secure the country\u2019s borders.\n\nPhoto\n\nMore than 3,000 migrants crossed the border into Austria from Hungary overnight, and another 3,000 or so were expected to arrive in the area on Thursday, the police and Red Cross officials at the border said. Rail service was halted between the two countries on Thursday, Reuters reported, because Austria could not handle the number of migrants crossing the border. It was not clear when service would resume.\n\nThe Hungarian police detained 3,321 people for crossing the border illegally on Wednesday, the highest daily figure so far this year, according to data published by the police.\n\nMr. Juncker on Wednesday issued an impassioned call for countries across the 28-nation bloc to overcome divisions, and he invoked Europe\u2019s historical imperative not to turn its back on the huge number of migrants streaming in.\n\nMr. Juncker proposed that the European Union accept and distribute 160,000 migrants across its member nations, and he implored Europeans not to forget that their ancestors had also fled hardship, poverty and famine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Juncker\u2019s plea appeared to have been embraced by Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz of Poland, who was quoted by Reuters as saying that she had heard and understood his message. Responding to comments by the opposition that Poland should not heed the European Union\u2019s calls, she said, \u201cCalls for Polish solidarity is no blackmail.\u201d\n\n\u201cActing jointly and efficiently in the E.U. is in our interest,\u201d Ms. Kopacz said. \u201cLet\u2019s be decent. President Juncker has reminded us that once, we were also refugees.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nYet in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel has been pushing for mandatory quotas, even some supporters of quotas acknowledged that they were unlikely to be accepted across the bloc.\n\nMr. Juncker\u2019s \u201clatest plan is definitely a move in the right direction,\u201d the left-leaning newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung said in an editorial on Thursday. \u201cHe will surely know, however, that the plan is very unlikely to be implemented. The resistance of individual countries may take it apart \u2014 and with it the entire European project.\u201d\n\nSuch resistance was evident in Hungary, where Janos Lazar, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, reiterated the country\u2019s rejection of a quota system. \u201cThe government won\u2019t accept the diktat, which several European powers are trying to force onto Hungary,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Netherlands, the far-right politician Geert Wilders was even more emphatic, calling the influx of migrants to Europe an \u201cIslamic invasion\u201d in a parliamentary debate on Thursday, Reuters reported, and underlining that country\u2019s struggle over how to respond to the crisis.\n\n\u201cMasses of young men in their 20s with beards singing \u2018Allahu akbar\u2019 across Europe,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the news agency. \u201cIt\u2019s an invasion that threatens our prosperity, our security, our culture and identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Dutch government has indicated a willingness to accept more migrants if the quota system is embraced across the bloc. But, as in many European countries, there has been a fierce debate in the Netherlands about the challenges of immigration, and Mr. Wilders and his Party for Freedom have been citing the crisis to argue that the country risks being overcome by Muslim migrants who do not subscribe to the Netherlands\u2019 vaunted liberal values.\n\nAdvocates for migrants argued that the commission\u2019s proposals, however well intentioned, were insufficient to address a growing challenge. The plan amounted to small steps, Iverna McGowan, the acting director of the European Institutions Office at Amnesty International, said on Wednesday, adding that more resources were needed to handle the influx in a humane way.\n\nMs. McGowan suggested that the commission was misguided in focusing its resources on returning migrants to so-called safe countries \u2014 like Albania, Serbia and Turkey that it says are free of persecution, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, indiscriminate violence and armed conflict. Such a policy might result in people who would otherwise qualify for asylum being sent back to persecution, she said.\n\nAustria and Germany threw open their borders over the weekend, in what was described as a one-time gesture for migrants. So far, however, there has been no attempt to halt the flow of arrivals. Almost all of the migrants who have come from Hungary in recent days have opted to continue on to Germany rather than apply for asylum in Austria.\n\nBut a backlash is brewing among far-right anti-immigrant groups in Germany, and it remains unclear how far the country\u2019s capacity can be stretched. Germany expects more than 800,000 asylum seekers to arrive this year, and more than half that number are already there, according to Sigmar Gabriel, the country\u2019s vice chancellor.\n\n\u201cGermany registered 450,000 refugees, including 105,000 in August and 73,000 in the first eight days of September,\u201d Mr. Gabriel told Parliament in Berlin. \u201cThere may be more than 100,000 in September.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Juncker on Wednesday issued an impassioned call for countries across the 28-nation bloc to overcome divisions, and he invoked Europe\u2019s historical imperative not to turn its back on the huge number of migrants streaming in.
