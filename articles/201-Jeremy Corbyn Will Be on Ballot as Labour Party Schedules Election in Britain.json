More than 100,000 have registered in the past year, but only those who registered before Jan. 12, 2016, will be allowed to vote for leader in the upcoming ballot, according to a party statement.\n\nThe discord in the party has been one of the many aftershocks of the June 23 referendum, in which Britons voted to leave the European Union.\n\nMr. Corbyn supported British membership in the bloc of 28 nations, and, by his estimation, about three-quarters of Labour Party supporters voted to remain. (The decision to leave was approved by 52 percent, with 48 percent voting to remain.)\n\nBut Mr. Corbyn\u2019s critics said his campaigning was halfhearted, lackluster and ineffective; shortly before the referendum, he estimated his enthusiasm for remaining in the European Union at \u201cseven, or seven and a half\u201d on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nAngela Eagle, a Labour lawmaker representing a district in northwest England, announced on Monday that she was challenging Mr. Corbyn for leadership of the party.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThese are dark times for Labour, and they are dangerous times for our country,\u201d Ms. Eagle said. \u201cA referendum to settle an argument in the Conservative Party has resulted in the country being torn apart: our economy damaged, our society hurt.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, she wrote she was glad the committee had reached a decision. \u201cI welcome the contest ahead.
