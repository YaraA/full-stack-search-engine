She has accused Mr. Ramadan of rape, sexual assault, willful violence, harassment and intimidation, her lawyers said.\n\nMr. Ramadan said in an announcement on his Facebook page over the weekend that the allegations were unfounded and that they were part of an organized campaign of slander by his enemies. He added that he had ordered his lawyer to sue Ms. Ayari for defamation. \u201cThe law has to take its course,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy attorney is handling the case, we expect a long and bitter fight.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Ayari, 40, is a fighter.\n\nAfter the 2015 Facebook post, she went on to write a book, \u201cI Chose to Be Free: A Survivor of Salafism in France,\u201d which exposed the mental and physical subjugation that she and other women suffered inside the Salafi community. She also described a sexual assault, though she did not identify her alleged assailant by name.\n\nThat stance brought her threats and condemnation, even from her own family. She is not on speaking terms with either of her parents, and her eldest son, now 18, has sided with her Salafi ex-husband against her. Now, she has once again been subjected to torrents of online abuse.\n\nShe grew up in a working-class family in Rouen, the daughter of an Algerian father and Tunisian mother, both Muslims but not particularly religious. Her parents divorced when she was young and both remarried, leaving Ms. Ayari feeling insecure and unwanted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe enrolled in college to study psychology and began to explore religion. She started to wear the veil and was quickly welcomed into a circle of conservative Muslims. Within months, they had set her up with a Tunisian Salafi who lived in Lyon. They married when she was 21.\n\nOne of the first things her husband, Bachir, did was buy her a jilbab, which covers a woman from head to toe, and a niqab, the veil that hides all but the eyes. The niqab was, in his words, the height of religiosity, the female garb that most pleased Allah.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Ms. Ayari lived a life of almost complete seclusion, bearing three children, sometimes spending days without leaving her bedroom and barely talking to anyone outside her husband\u2019s family and immediate circle. Salafis teach that only they follow the true way, drawn from the time of the Prophet Muhammad. They reject association with those outside their sect.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

As the children grew up, she urged him to find work but he complained that racism and discrimination in France prevented him from finding a job. She gradually came to regard his Salafi dress and long beard as an excuse not to work.\n\nAs their marriage deteriorated, she said, her husband became abusive. When a social services official told her she lived in a prison and advised her to seek psychological help, she realized she had to break out.\n\n\u201cIt is a trap, especially for women, because they say you have to take the veil, and marry and not study, and they want you just to be a submissive woman,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe began to question the patriarchal Salafist strictures that command adherents to obey the example of the prophet unquestioningly, and that seemed arranged particularly to suit men.\n\nPhoto\n\nEventually, Ms. Ayari fled with her children. But restarting her life as a single mother while grappling with a crisis of faith proved to be too big a leap. She suffered a nervous breakdown and lost custody of her children for two years.\n\nThe internet, and particularly Facebook, has been her companion along the way. As she started questioning the extreme ideology of Salafism, she began following the teaching of Mr. Ramadan, who became an online instructor and mentor, eventually suggesting they meet in Paris where he was attending a conference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe said she viewed him as a saint, and was shocked and terrified by what she says was his violent assault and his threats to her to remain silent afterward.\n\nSince naming him as her attacker, she says she has been inundated with insults and abuse. \u201cThe reaction, the buzz, really frightened me,\u201d she said in the phone interview.\n\n\u201cI am very scared of being recognized when I go out in the street,\u201d she went on. \u201cI am scared that they will hurt my children, that they know where I live. It is very hard.\u201d\n\nYet, she says the messages she has received from other women, many of them in abusive marriages or struggling with similar dilemmas over abandoning the veil, give her a sense of purpose.\n\nTwo years ago she founded a nonprofit association called Liberatrices, which helps women in the same straits she had been in. She gives talks in schools and at workshops against radical Islam, and helps women seeking legal advice and refuge from abuse.\n\nBanning the burqa and niqab, as France has, was not the solution, she said. Salafi leaders have used the ban to stoke anger among their followers, and many women have opted to stay home rather than go out without the coverings, and so have become even more isolated.\n\nInstead of being hit with fines, women should be made to attend educational workshops, she said. \u201cYou need to resolve the problem with discussion, comprehension, softness and above all not exclusion.\u201d\n\nAnd countering the Salafist message, she said, is essential.\n\n\u201cI took a long time to open my eyes, to understand that they indoctrinated us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to say to all women that they should speak out, that they should not be scared, that they are not inferior beings to men, that they are equal to men, that they should fight to be respected and that you do not have to wear a veil to be a good Muslim.\u201d", "summary": "After the 2015 Facebook post, she went on to write a book, \u201cI Chose to Be Free: A Survivor of Salafism in France,\u201d which exposed the mental and physical subjugation that she and other women suffered inside the Salafi community.For the next 10 years, Ms. Ayari lived a life of almost complete seclusion, bearing three children, sometimes spending days without leaving her bedroom and barely talking to anyone outside her husband\u2019s family and immediate circle.She began to question the patriarchal Salafist strictures that command adherents to obey the example of the prophet unquestioningly, and that seemed arranged particularly to suit men.As she started questioning the extreme ideology of Salafism, she began following the teaching of Mr. Ramadan, who became an online instructor and mentor, eventually suggesting they meet in Paris where he was attending a conference.Yet, she says the messages she has received from other women, many of them in abusive marriages or struggling with similar dilemmas over abandoning the veil, give her a sense of purpose."}
