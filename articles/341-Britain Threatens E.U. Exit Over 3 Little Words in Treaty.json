Exit Over 3 Little Words in Treaty", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/world/europe/cameron-eu-brexit.html", "body": "But experts say that the commitment to an \u201cever closer union\u201d would be hard to expunge from the union\u2019s main treaty, and that it has no legal force anyway.\n\nAmong critics of the European Union in Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party, there is considerable pressure to force a change in that stated European goal, which they see as an affront to national sovereignty.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament this month, Liam Fox, a former defense secretary, described the term as \u201cthe one thing with the European Union with which I have the greatest problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not believe in ever closer union,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause for me, the logical endpoint of ever closer union is union, and I do not want to lose our status as a sovereign, independent nation.\u201d\n\nA fellow Conservative, Steve Baker, said, \u201cCurrent circumstances do lead to ever closer union and a single nation state.\u201d Another, Craig Mackinlay, said of ever closer union: \u201cAs one advertiser says of its product, it means exactly what it says on the tin.\u201d\n\nIn Continental Europe, there is some puzzlement at the intensity of the opposition to the phrase, particularly since previous British governments have been more pragmatic.\n\n\u201cEver closer union among the peoples of Europe\u201d are the words featured in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome, signed in 1957, the founding treaty for a bloc that Britain joined in 1973.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe words echo the phrase, \u201cWe the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union,\u201d which is the start of the preamble to the American Constitution.\n\nDuring talks on the Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1992, the inclusion of \u201cever closer union\u201d was in doubt, but it was supported by former Prime Minister John Major, a Conservative \u2014 albeit as an alternative to a formulation deemed worse.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I fail to understand why this suddenly became a major negotiating objective for Cameron.\u201d\n\nStephen Wall, a former senior official in the British government, said Britain had been \u201crelieved\u201d to see the demise of the Dutch draft of the Maastricht Treaty, and had relaxed about the use of the now much-maligned three words.\n\n\u201cIn John Major\u2019s government, anything that was in earlier treaties allowed ministers to go to Parliament and say that this was nothing new,\u201d said Mr. Wall, now a historian of Britain\u2019s relations with the European Union.\n\n\u201cMargaret Thatcher never objected, as it was ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, which she saw as something organic rather than something imposed on governments,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast week, Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, told the British newspaper The Guardian that scrapping the phrase would require a treaty change, a step that needs the approval of all 28 European Union nations.\n\nAn alternative might be to secure a declaration making clear that the phrase does not apply to Britain, to be added to the next version of the treaty whenever it is revised.\n\nMr. Wall said he believed British concerns derived from a sense of insecurity about the European Union, rooted in a fear of being outmaneuvered and outvoted.\n\n\u201cWe have a more literalistic approach that affects the way we negotiate and look at the text,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the points Tony Blair used to make is that one of the reasons why we have to argue over every dot and comma is that we have never succeeded in forming a close relationship with a partner in the way that the French and Germans have \u2014 where they know that, if it comes to it, they will support each other. The only protection for us is in legal texts.\u201d\n\nAs part of his renegotiation, Mr. Cameron also wants changes to allow the restriction of some social welfare benefits for European migrants for four years; guarantees that nations, like Britain, that use their own currency rather than the euro will not suffer economic discrimination; and more powers for national parliaments to block European laws.\n\nMaurice Fraser, head of the European Institute at the London School of Economics, said Mr. Cameron should concentrate on these more practical changes. Ever closer union is, he said, \u201ca handy way for euroskeptics to encapsulate their longstanding grievance about the European Union: that no one can see the high-water mark of European integration; it just goes on, relentlessly.\u201d", "summary": "During talks on the Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1992, the inclusion of \u201cever closer union\u201d was in doubt, but it was supported by former Prime Minister John Major, a Conservative \u2014 albeit as an alternative to a formulation deemed worse.Rolf-Dieter Krause, the chief correspondent in Brussels for the German broadcaster ARD, who reported on the Maastricht negotiations, recalled that \u201cever closer union\u201d was in the final text \u201cdue to British requests.\u201dStephen Wall, a former senior official in the British government, said Britain had been \u201crelieved\u201d to see the demise of the Dutch draft of the Maastricht Treaty, and had relaxed about the use of the now much-maligned three words.\u201cIn John Major\u2019s government, anything that was in earlier treaties allowed ministers to go to Parliament and say that this was nothing new,\u201d said Mr. Wall, now a historian of Britain\u2019s relations with the European Union.\u201cOne of the points Tony Blair used to make is that one of the reasons why we have to argue over every dot and comma is that we have never succeeded in forming a close relationship with a partner in the way that the French and Germans have \u2014 where they know that, if it comes to it, they will support each other."}
