The result has been that nations along the trail have had to fend for themselves, working together unofficially to allow the migrants to freely cross borders \u2014 as long as they also exited at the other end \u2014 on their way to Germany.\n\nGermany has opened its arms to the new arrivals and has said it expects as many as a million to try to settle there this year.\n\nBut Mr. Seehofer told the Bavarian lawmakers that if an agreement could not be reached with Ms. Merkel this weekend to limit the newcomers, he would examine \u201cjudicial and political measures,\u201d although he did not get more specific.\n\nBavaria has borne the brunt of handling the tens of thousands of arrivals in Germany \u2014 15,000 people alone over the past weekend \u2014 since the first trains began arriving in Munich this summer. There, with the help of volunteers, refugees begin the first steps of the asylum process and are then dispersed throughout the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe days of cheering welcomes, however, have given way to a palpable discontent, and Mr. Seehofer said many constituents had questioned whether the government has the situation under control.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough Mr. Seehofer has repeatedly said he will not allow the coalition government to collapse, he refused to comment on a report in the newspaper Bild on Wednesday that, as a last resort, he was considering pulling the three ministers from his party from Ms. Merkel\u2019s cabinet.\n\nFederal prosecutors on Wednesday charged a 44-year-old German man with attempted murder in the stabbing in Cologne last Saturday of a mayoral candidate in the city, Henriette Reker, an attack the authorities said was driven by the man\u2019s rage over Ms. Reker\u2019s work with refugees.\n\nMs. Reker, who is expected to recover, won the election Sunday. Four others were hurt in the attack, which shocked the country.\n\nMs. Merkel, who departed Wednesday for a trip to China, has refused to be drawn into a debate over what some observers view as Bavarian saber-rattling. Her spokesman said Ms. Merkel viewed the talks on Sunday as a way to maintain the dialogue among the coalition leaders.\n\nWhile the chancellor insisted that Berlin and Vienna were cooperating, the tensions between the two governments worsened on Wednesday, with each side accusing the other of failing to maintain a manageable flow at certain border crossings.\n\nGermany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, issued a rare and blistering attack on Austria, saying it \u201cwas out of order\u201d for busing refugees to the border with Bavaria, unannounced and under cover of darkness. The Austrians accuse the Germans of being too slow to admit arrivals.\n\nThe government in Vienna had promised after \u201c\u2018intensive consultations\u201d to improve, Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said, adding, \u201cI expect that to happen immediately.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe raised the possibility of distinguishing among asylum seekers, saying that Afghans, who are arriving in the second-highest numbers, behind Syrians, were likely to be sent home.\n\n\u201cPeople who come to us as refugees from Afghanistan cannot all expect to be able to stay in Germany,\u201d he said, noting that German troops, police and development aid continue to pour into Afghanistan and that not all areas there are unsafe. (The likelihood of harm if a person is returned to his or her native country is a condition for granting asylum.)\n\nIn Austria late Tuesday, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, the interior minister, said she had ordered her office to begin exploring plans for a \u201csolid, technical barrier several kilometers long.\u201d Pressed about the issue on Austrian public television on Wednesday, she said, \u201cOf course it is about a fence.\u201d Her office insisted that any barrier would not close off the border, but serve to control it to ensure security.\n\nBut the Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, later said that \u201cthere will not be a fence around Austria,\u201d adding that he had only asked Ms. Mikl-Leitner to consider how to better secure the southern border.\n\nNevertheless, Ms. Mikl-Leitner\u2019s announcement appeared to escalate international tensions and could result in more restrictive borders in Slovenia.\n\nThe migrant issue, and the debate over how to respond to it, continues to resonate in many parts of the world. On Tuesday, Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister, used his first major address since his ouster last month to denounce Europe\u2019s migration policies, warning that the continent risked \u201cfundamentally weakening itself\u201d through \u201cmisguided altruism.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll countries that say \u2018anyone who gets here can stay here\u2019 are now in peril, given the scale of the population movements that are starting to be seen,\u201d he said in London at a lecture honoring Margaret Thatcher.\n\nMr. Abbott\u2019s government refused to accept asylum seekers intercepted at sea, instead sending them to offshore camps. He recommended the same approach for Europe. \u201cThis means turning boats around,\u201d he said.", "summary": "The developments highlighted the growing consequences of the European Union\u2019s failure to forge a common solution to the problem of having hundreds of thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan and other strife-ridden countries trek through the continent on their way to seeking new lives in the heart of Europe.Although Mr. Seehofer has repeatedly said he will not allow the coalition government to collapse, he refused to comment on a report in the newspaper Bild on Wednesday that, as a last resort, he was considering pulling the three ministers from his party from Ms. Merkel\u2019s cabinet.While the chancellor insisted that Berlin and Vienna were cooperating, the tensions between the two governments worsened on Wednesday, with each side accusing the other of failing to maintain a manageable flow at certain border crossings.Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, issued a rare and blistering attack on Austria, saying it \u201cwas out of order\u201d for busing refugees to the border with Bavaria, unannounced and under cover of darkness.On Tuesday, Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister, used his first major address since his ouster last month to denounce Europe\u2019s migration policies, warning that the continent risked \u201cfundamentally weakening itself\u201d through \u201cmisguided altruism.\u201d"}
