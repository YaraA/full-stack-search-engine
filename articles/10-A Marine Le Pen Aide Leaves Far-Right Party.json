He also helped push a proposal to leave the euro currency area.\n\nBut Ms. Le Pen\u2019s lackluster debate performance and her subsequent loss to the centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron opened a rift in the National Front, between proponents of Mr. Philippot\u2019s euro-skepticism and protectionism and an older guard that wanted to focus on immigration and Islam.\n\nMany of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s advisers say that her economic appeals ultimately fell flat and that she was too late in pushing identity issues. Mr. Philippot\u2019s camp sees the election as a setback but notes that more people supported the National Front than in any previous election.\n\n\u201cMarine Le Pen has been having a hard time accepting that the National Front is at the right of the political spectrum,\u201d said Nicolas Lebourg, a historian who studies the far-right, noting that she had courted supporters of the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the presidential runoff \u201cmostly because right-wing voters don\u2019t want to leave the euro.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut those same right-wing voters in France are closer to the identity politics of Marine Le Pen, so she might want the party to go this way,\u201d he added.\n\nIn legislative elections in June, the National Front did not fare as well as Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s France Unbowed party. He has emerged as the most vocal critic of Mr. Macron\u2019s young presidency.\n\nMs. Le Pen and her allies have had a more muted presence on the French political scene \u2014 as have more mainstream parties, like the struggling Socialists, who recently announced that they were going to sell their headquarters in an upscale Parisian neighborhood.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough tensions around Mr. Philippot had been brewing at the National Front for months, they erupted into plain sight in recent weeks over a small think tank called The Patriots that he created shortly after the elections.\n\nParty officials accused Mr. Philippot of promoting his own political movement instead of working to rebuild the National Front.\n\nTensions rose further last week when far-right militants criticized Mr. Philippot on social media for going to a couscous restaurant in Strasbourg, France, instead of eating choucroute, the region\u2019s traditional dish of sauerkraut and sausages.\n\nMs. Le Pen\u2019s demotion of Mr. Philippot on Wednesday came after she repeatedly asked him to step down as president of The Patriots, which he repeatedly declined to do.\n\nNeither appeared eager to put a final nail in the coffin of a close relationship. In an interview with The New York Times in 2015, Mr. Philippot described his first meeting with Ms. Le Pen, in 2009, as a kind of political love at first sight and said that they \u201cconnected both on a human and a political level.\u201c\n\nAfter his departure, National Front officials blamed Mr. Philippot for refusing to discuss a change in strategy ahead of a party congress set for March.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
