The article has been invoked only once \u2014 after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\n\u201cThey have an obligation to make payments,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview. \u201cMany NATO nations are not making payments, are not making what they\u2019re supposed to make.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAsked whether the United States would come to the aid of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 three Baltic states that were invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, and joined NATO in 2004 \u2014 in the event of a Russian invasion, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you what I\u2019d do because I don\u2019t want Putin to know what I\u2019d do,\u201d referring to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, for whom Mr. Trump has expressed admiration.\n\nReminded that NATO members are obligated by treaty to come to one another\u2019s defense, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cHave they fulfilled their obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.\u201d\n\nAsked on Thursday about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon of Britain snapped: \u201cArticle 5 is an absolute commitment. It doesn\u2019t come with conditions or caveats.\u201d\n\nLess than two weeks ago, at a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw, Mr. Obama reassured America\u2019s allies that \u201cin good times and in bad, Europe can count on the United States \u2014 always.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of Estonia, took to Twitter to emphasize that his country was one of only five NATO members to meet the target that it spend 2 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 a broad measure of economic activity \u2014 on military spending. (The others are the United States, Britain, Poland and Greece.)\n\nMr. Ilves also noted that Estonia contributed troops to the fight in Afghanistan in keeping with Article 5.\n\nArtis Pabriks, a former foreign and defense minister of Latvia, which borders Russia and has stepped up military spending, wrote on Twitter: \u201cIf Trump doubts NATO solidarity in the case of Article 5, then his election is dangerous for Baltic security.\u201d\n\nLithuania\u2019s president, Dalia Grybauskaite, tried to calm her citizens. \u201cRegardless of who becomes the next president of the U.S., we trust America,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cIt has always defended nations under attack, and will do so in the future.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

We are modernizing our armed forces, we have reinstituted conscription and our defense spending will reach 2 percent of G.D.P. in 2018. I do not think interpretations of candidate Trump\u2019s remarks are necessary. We know that the U.S. will remain our most important partner.\u201d\n\nIn Russia, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments met with approval. Alexei Pushkov, head of the foreign relations committee of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, contrasted Mr. Trump with Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. \u201cClinton\u2019s creed: strengthen the U.S.\u2019s anti-Russian alliances. Trump\u2019s creed: respond only to real threats,\u201d Mr. Pushkov wrote. \u201cAggressive banality versus common sense.\u201d\n\nNATO\u2019s 28 members pledged at summit meetings in Wales in 2014 and in Warsaw this month to do more to meet the 2 percent of GDP spending target, and Mr. Stoltenberg has made reaching that goal a priority.\n\nXenia Wickett, the head of the United States and Americas program at Chatham House, a foreign policy think tank based in London, said Mr. Trump was echoing \u2014 albeit in far less diplomatic terms \u2014 concerns raised by a succession of American secretaries of defense, including the three who have served Mr. Obama: Robert M. Gates, Leon E. Panetta and Ashton B. Carter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is no longer willing to cover the approximately 75 percent of the NATO budget that it currently does,\u201d Ms. Wickett wrote in an email. \u201cTrump takes it to the extreme, which is new, but the direction is not new. Trump wants to see a more \u2018fair\u2019 division of labor.\u201d She added, \u201cUnfortunately, his way of expressing it is likely to aid our adversaries rather than assist the alliance.\u201d\n\nAlexandra de Hoop Scheffer, the head of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization, said too much was being made of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. She said the imbalance in NATO spending \u201cis just not sustainable,\u201d adding, \u201cTrump is taking the burden-sharing debate to extreme levels, by directly calling into question U.S. responsibility as a NATO member state to fulfill its obligations under Article 5, in case a NATO member state got attacked by Russia.\u201d\n\nShe added that European leaders needed to persuade their citizens \u201cof the importance of investing in defense to face current and future security challenges.\u201d\n\nBut Carl Bildt, a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden, said he feared that Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks would embolden autocratic and aggressive powers. \u201cThere is certainly a risk that he will encourage states like Russia and China to take the risk that U.S. will not stand up for its allies and its commitments, and that could be extremely dangerous for global stability,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s downplaying not only the defense of common interests, but also the defense of common values. Democracy seems nearly to be a derogatory term for him.\u201d\n\n"}
