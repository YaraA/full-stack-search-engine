Nationally, many are regarding Mr. Rajoy the same way, and he may now face added pressure to follow Mr. Mas\u2019s example and get out of the way to avoid new national elections, which few seem to want.\n\nBut a reinvigorated Catalonia also gives new ammunition to Mr. Rajoy, who has long presented himself as the defender of Spanish unity.\n\nAs he seeks to persuade other parties to allow him to continue in office, Mr. Rajoy is expected to wield the argument that Spain needs a coalition strong enough to defeat Catalonia\u2019s separatist push.\n\n\u201cRajoy will surely try hard to convert a revived Catalan challenge into an argument to force together a Spanish coalition, but I\u2019m less sure that it will work,\u201d said Josep Ramoneda, a Catalan political columnist. \u201cThe example of Mas could instead give reasons to reach the conclusion that any coalition first requires changing the leader.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Juan Luis Cebr\u00edan, the president and co-founder of El Pa\u00eds, Spain\u2019s leading newspaper, called on the right-wing Popular Party to force \u201cthe honorable withdrawal\u201d of Mr. Rajoy.\n\n\u201cThe right should demonstrate that it is working for the good of Spain and not for the continuity of a leader whose credibility has been burned by his own perplexity, responsible in no small measure for the disastrous political evolution in Catalonia,\u201d Mr. Cebr\u00edan wrote in an editorial.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe calculations for the leaders of Spain\u2019s other main political parties who are engaged in the search for a workable national government may be no easier, however.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez, the Socialist leader, made clear on Monday that he would like to form a coalition with two upstart parties \u2014 Citizens and Podemos \u2014 and consign Mr. Rajoy and his party to the opposition.\n\n\u201cI want to have an understanding as much with Podemos as with Citizens,\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cWe\u2019re united by change.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, the Socialist leader, eventually became prime minister, with the support of more radical-left parties, after similarly inconclusive elections in October.\n\nBut Mr. S\u00e1nchez faces significant obstacles to forming his three-way coalition, including Catalonia. He and his Socialist Party have so far tried to fudge their position, backing Mr. Rajoy\u2019s firm stance toward Catalonia, while saying vaguely that they would prefer that the matter be left to a broader constitutional overhaul. That is not a position likely to hold up much longer, especially as Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan separatists seek to fast-track Catalonia\u2019s independence.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s two potential coalition partners stand solidly on opposite sides of the issue.\n\nCitizens, a Catalan-based party, is against secession. Podemos, which has transformed itself from a left-leaning protest movement to a political party in about two years, is the only party that supports allowing the Catalans to hold an independence referendum.\n\nIt is not a pledge that Podemos can now back away from easily, as it helped make the party the biggest vote-getter in Catalonia during the national elections.\n\nMr. S\u00e1nchez is also in an uncomfortable position within his own party, his leadership\u2019s having been weakened by the Socialists\u2019s worst showing in a national election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Socialists hold the key to the governability of Spain, but also have a fragile leadership and the most at stake,\u201d said Jaime Pastor, a professor of politics at the Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia in Madrid.\n\n\u201cThe Socialists could guarantee our stability by joining a grand coalition\u201d \u2014 meaning joining with Mr. Rajoy \u2014 \u201cbut that could also open the door for Podemos to take over the left.\u201d\n\nAs difficult as the coalition talks are, however, the resolution of Catalonia\u2019s crisis will now place more pressure on national leaders to quickly form a coalition, too.\n\nShort of that, they risk a prolonged period of instability for Spain, which the revived Catalan secession drive and the tension it has generated with Madrid will only add to. Mr. Puigdemont, the new Catalan leader, has taken up where Mr. Mas left off.\n\nIn his first speech on Sunday, he told regional lawmakers that his government would put in place a plan to set up the structures of an independent Catalan republic within 18 months, including an autonomous tax agency.\n\nEven before Mr. Puigdemont had been formally voted into office, however, Mr. Rajoy warned him that Spain has \u201cmore instruments than ever to defend our unity.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Rajoy\u2019s administration has political and legal tools to block the Catalan separatists, their renewed challenge, not least, is likely to start raising concerns about Spain\u2019s economic governance.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Catalonia is likely to make the economic lobbies raise the pressure soon on politicians to agree on a coalition that guarantees at least some sort of stability for Spain,\u201d said Mr. Pastor, the politics professor.", "summary": "Both Mr. Mas and Mr. Rajoy \u2014 the two central antagonists in Catalonia\u2019s long-building dispute with Madrid \u2014 saw their popularity plummet after making austerity cuts and failing to take responsibility for corruption scandals in their parties.As he seeks to persuade other parties to allow him to continue in office, Mr. Rajoy is expected to wield the argument that Spain needs a coalition strong enough to defeat Catalonia\u2019s separatist push.\u201cThe right should demonstrate that it is working for the good of Spain and not for the continuity of a leader whose credibility has been burned by his own perplexity, responsible in no small measure for the disastrous political evolution in Catalonia,\u201d Mr. Cebr\u00edan wrote in an editorial.\u201cThe Socialists hold the key to the governability of Spain, but also have a fragile leadership and the most at stake,\u201d said Jaime Pastor, a professor of politics at the Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia in Madrid.In his first speech on Sunday, he told regional lawmakers that his government would put in place a plan to set up the structures of an independent Catalan republic within 18 months, including an autonomous tax agency."}
