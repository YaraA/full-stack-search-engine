{"title": "Jeremy Corbyn, Unlikely Front-Runner for Labour Leader, Poised to Win Party Vote", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/world/europe/jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-leader-britain.html", "body": "As Labour leader, Mr. Corbyn would be some way from power, but his views could influence policy, particularly on foreign affairs. Mr. Cameron, for example, wants to know the position of the new Labour leader before asking Parliament to authorize military strikes in Syria. Two years ago, Mr. Cameron lost a vote on the issue, and Mr. Corbyn was a staunch opponent.\n\nThen there is a looming referendum on whether Britain should stay in the European Union, due by the end of 2017, in which Labour\u2019s role will be important. Though Mr. Corbyn has not said he wants Britain to leave the bloc, he has said he voted against British membership of the bloc\u2019s forerunner in a plebiscite in 1975.\n\nAnd in Washington there may be unease at the prospect of the main British opposition party\u2019s being led by a fierce critic of American foreign policy \u2014 one who, without endorsing their actions, has described Hamas and Hezbollah as \u201cfriends.\u201d\n\nHardly anyone contemplated such an outcome after the party\u2019s previous leader, Ed Miliband, led Labour to defeat in May\u2019s general election, on a platform already seen as being to the left of Mr. Blair. After that electoral rebuff, most expected the right of the party to reclaim the leadership. Instead the Blairites have been trying frantically \u2014 apparently with little success \u2014 to derail Mr. Corbyn, a vegetarian teetotaler based in North London who made a career of rebelling against the party line and until now had little public profile outside of party activists.\n\nSteven Fielding, professor of political history at Nottingham University, said Mr. Corbyn\u2019s rise had \u201ctaken everyone by surprise,\u201d yet even opponents concede that his campaign has energized a cohort of enthusiastic, and often young, supporters.\n\nSuch people, Mr. Corbyn said at a rally in London this week, had been \u201cwritten off as being a nonpolitical generation, when in reality they were a political generation that politics had written off.\u201d\n\nAlthough Britain\u2019s economy is growing fast, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s message has struck a chord with workers and families still feeling the aftershocks of Europe\u2019s financial crisis of 2008.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor many, prospects remain poor, wages low and employment insecure. Soaring housing prices in the south have left many locked out of the real estate market. Bankers remain the target of simmering resentment.\n\nStill, chance played a big part in Mr. Corbyn\u2019s rise, not least because he had to be persuaded to run as the left\u2019s leadership candidate, a position traditionally akin to that of a sacrificial victim.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But, once there, he exploited a change of rules for the election of Labour leader, which had been devised to bolster the power of individual party members and curtail the influence of trade unions.\n\nFor just three British pounds, about $4.60, anyone can become a \u201cregistered supporter\u201d and take part in what has become something like an American-style primary. The party, which had around 187,000 members before the May general election, has gained more than 105,000 since, plus an additional 112,000 \u201cregistered supporters.\u201d When those affiliated to the party, mainly through unions, are added, more than half a million people have a vote. The voting has been underway for several weeks.\n\nThis system is now engulfed in controversy amid claims of organized efforts by hard-left supporters to register Corbyn voters and allegations that Conservative supporters have signed up to vote for Mr. Corbyn, calculating that this will sabotage Labour\u2019s chances in the next election. Having won a five-year term in May, Mr. Cameron does not have to call another election until 2020.\n\nPerhaps most of all, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s success reflects Labour\u2019s internal failure to confront the toxic legacy of the war in Iraq, which Mr. Blair joined President George W. Bush in starting, and of the economic policies that many link to the financial crash.\n\nMr. Corbyn\u2019s opponents \u2014 Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham and Liz Kendall \u2014 are all associated to varying degrees with a Blairite, centrist vision, yet none seem to have the charisma Mr. Blair possessed in 1994 when he won the party leadership.\n\nAfter a televised debate among the current four contenders, the Daily Telegraph commentator Dan Hodges declared Ms. Cooper the best performer, but lampooned her tendency to lapse into the type of robotic politician-style of speaking that has repelled many voters.\n\n\u201cEach position she adopts,\u201d Mr. Hodges wrote, \u201cis carefully calculated to place herself in a position of perfect equilibrium between two other competing positions. \u2018Tea or coffee, Yvette?\u2019 \u2018Well, I love tea. But I think it would be a serious mistake to ignore the importance of coffee.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Fielding sees Mr. Corbyn\u2019s success as a \u201csign of alienation from the system as it exists,\u201d adding that his three opponents are viewed by many within the party as \u201cTory-lite,\u201d a reference to Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservatives.\n\nThe view among many supporters, Mr. Fielding added, was that \u201cvoting for Jeremy Corbyn might not work, but at least it is something that we believe in \u2014 and maybe it will work.\u201d\n\nThat chimes with the experience of the former Labour minister Chris Mullin, when he explained his reservations about Mr. Corbyn to party supporters.\n\n\u201cGently I pointed out,\u201d Mr. Mullin wrote in The Guardian, \u201cthat a party led by Corbyn, saintly and decent man that he is, was likely to be unelectable. Which only met with the riposte that since the other three candidates appear to be unelectable too, why not go for the real thing?\u201d\n\nYet the real thing would take Labour further to the left than at any time since 1983, which history suggests would be a high risk.\n\nIn that year, Mr. Corbyn and Mr. Blair entered Parliament, but Labour went down to a crushing defeat, and its manifesto was called \u201cthe longest suicide note in history.\u201d", "summary": "And in Washington there may be unease at the prospect of the main British opposition party\u2019s being led by a fierce critic of American foreign policy \u2014 one who, without endorsing their actions, has described Hamas and Hezbollah as \u201cfriends.\u201d Perhaps most of all, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s success reflects Labour\u2019s internal failure to confront the toxic legacy of the war in Iraq, which Mr. Blair joined President George W.
