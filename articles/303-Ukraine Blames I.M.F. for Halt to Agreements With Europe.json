On Friday in Parliament, where Mr. Azarov appeared with other government ministers, he said that the conditions for aid from the West were too stiff and that Ukraine needed to take steps to improve its economic relationship with Russia.\n\n\u201cThe I.M.F. position presented in the letter dated Nov. 20 was the last straw,\u201d Mr. Azarov said. \u201cThis decision is hard, but it\u2019s the only one possible in the economic situation in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHis comments drew a roar of jeers and denunciations from opposing lawmakers, who also threw sheaves of papers at him.\n\nWhile Mr. Azarov sought to pin responsibility on the I.M.F., other officials said the decision to back away from the agreements was the result of fierce pressure by Russia, including threats of trade embargoes and other punitive steps that would have devastated the Ukrainian economy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Biden Jr. had called Mr. Yanukovich to express disappointment over the decision to \u201cdelay preparations for signature\u201d of the European Union accords.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, speaking to reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in St. Petersburg, denied any strong-arming. He said Russia had merely informed Ukraine that if it signed a free trade deal with Europe, Russia would take steps to protect its businesses from an influx of cheap European goods through Ukraine by imposing new trade restrictions.\n\nMr. Putin said it was the Europeans who were trying to pressure Ukraine and refusing to accept its decision to delay the accords. \u201cThis is pressure, this is blackmail,\u201d Mr. Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript of his remarks.\n\nAsked about the phone call between Mr. Yanukovich and Ms. Grybauskaite, Mr. Putin used the moment to take a jab at the United States over its surveillance programs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the Ukrainian and Lithuanian presidents discussed \u2014 you could maybe ask our American friends,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will tell you.\u201d"}
