{"title": "Smugglers Prey on Migrants Desperate to Find Back Doors to Europe", "authors": ["Liz Alderman"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/world/europe/european-union-migrant-crisis-smuggling.html", "body": "In Greece, smugglers are peddling offers to take migrants clandestinely to Italy, either by boat from the Greek mainland or via a more precarious route walking through the mountainous terrain of Albania, where they can then cross the Adriatic Sea. Others are offering to take them on less guarded paths through Macedonian forests, or to Bulgaria to reach Serbia and beyond.\n\nIn the camp at Idomeni, at the border with Macedonia, where more than 13,000 migrants have been stuck in muddy conditions after Macedonia sealed its border, talk of smuggling is everywhere. Migrants point to the Hara Hotel and to gas stations along the highway to Idomeni as places where smugglers loiter and operate.\n\nVideo\n\nEuropol and Italian officials are also concerned that old migrant routes through Libya or Egypt, which became much less appealing after Germany said it would welcome legitimate asylum seekers last year, may be revived to get people to the Italian island of Lampedusa. And in Northern Europe, Finland and Scandinavian governments are monitoring whether smugglers may intensify the use of a route through Russia, including via the Black Sea from Turkey.\n\nSo far, the authorities have yet to see a major migrant flow along any of those paths. But governments are girding for the possibility, especially when the weather turns warmer in spring.\n\nAlbania deployed hundreds of special police officers this week to its frontiers with Greece and Macedonia. Italy said Friday that it would send about two dozen officers to help Albania patrol its border. Mario Morcone, the Italian Interior Ministry\u2019s top immigration official, said discussions with the Albanian government were underway \u201con how to best collaborate,\u201d including providing technological assistance. While there were \u201cno concrete signals\u201d yet of an imminent influx through the Adriatic, Italy has stepped up its patrols in those waters, he said.\n\nBulgaria announced plans on Friday to build a fence on the Greek border and to step up existing police patrols in case of \u201ceventual increased migration pressure.\u201d The government took delivery of 40 Land Rovers donated by Britain this week to capture and return refugees at the country\u2019s borders with Turkey and Serbia.\n\nPhoto\n\nNATO is patrolling the territorial waters of Turkey and Greece, where Mr. Salami and more than 100,000 other migrants have made perilous crossings since January. To try to stop the smugglers who make many of the migrants\u2019 voyages possible, NATO is working to improve information exchanges between both countries and Frontex, Europe\u2019s border agency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhether such efforts prove effective remains to be seen. Last year, migrant smuggling became the fastest-growing criminal market in Europe, according to a recent Europol report, with an estimated turnover of \u20ac3 billion to \u20ac6 billion, or $3.3 billion to $6.6 billion. The amount could double or triple if the scale of the current migration crisis persists this year, the agency warned.\n\n\u201cSmugglers are like the Hydra: You cut off one head and two new ones spring up,\u201d said Rear Adm. Iwannis Karageorgopoulos, the director general for security and law enforcement at the Greek Coast Guard.\n\n\u201cThe best way to eradicate migrant smugglers is to take away their clientele,\u201d he said.\n\nEurope is trying to do that in part by signaling to migrants that they have no hope of reaching their intended destinations via the route a million people or more used last year, from Greece through Macedonia and the Balkans and on to Austria and then Germany.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

In Piraeus, migrants said some smugglers talked of stashing people in trucks destined for Italy or Northern Europe, raising the prospect of tragedies like an episode last year when 71 migrants suffocated in a truck found abandoned by smugglers in Austria near the border with Hungary. Human rights groups said migrants moving recently through Bulgaria reported violent beatings by police officers and local vigilante groups, and being set upon by dogs in Macedonia.\n\nIn Serbia, which could remain part of the migrant path if flows pick up from Albania, Bulgaria or Romania, the border closings have already revived old smuggling networks after years of police clampdowns. This week, smugglers brought 45 Kurds into Serbia using an old path from Bulgaria, said Jelena Hrnjak, the program manager at Atina, an aid group working with the International Rescue Committee.\n\nMigrants who have no money left, especially unaccompanied minors, are frequently put into a kind of \u201cdebt bondage\u201d by the smugglers. Ms. Hrnjak said her group documented numerous cases of sexual exploitation of Pakistani boys, including placing nude photographs of them on the Internet and demanding that their families send money.\n\nBack at Piraeus port, where more than 3,000 migrants are camped in pup tents and cargo warehouses facing the Aegean Sea, the smugglers have found fresh quarry. After debarking from the ferry, Mr. Salami said men offered to make false visas, good for entry into the European countries that are members of the Schengen zone of passport-free travel, for \u20ac4,500, \u201cso that we can go anywhere in Europe.\u201d\n\nMirwas Mahmoodi, a 21-year-old Afghan migrant, listened in desperation to some who promised to make a fake ID and put him on a plane to enter Germany \u201clegally\u201d if he paid \u20ac8,000. When he told them he was short of cash, they offered to take him through Macedonian forests for \u20ac1,000 to continue north.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey told me, \u2018The border is closed forever,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201c \u2018You\u2019ll never get to Europe unless you use me.\u2019 \u201d", "summary": "In Greece, smugglers are peddling offers to take migrants clandestinely to Italy, either by boat from the Greek mainland or via a more precarious route walking through the mountainous terrain of Albania, where they can then cross the Adriatic Sea.
