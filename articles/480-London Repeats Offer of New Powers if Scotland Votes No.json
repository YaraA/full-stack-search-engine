{"title": "London Repeats Offer of New Powers if Scotland Votes No", "authors": ["Alan Cowell"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/europe/scotland-referendum.html", "body": "But Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s pro-independence deputy first minister, declared during a visit to a steelworks, \u201cMy feeling going around the country is that we\u2019ve got an enormous sense of growing confidence in Scotland, and a feeling that, having come this far, we should keep control of the future of this country where it is just now, in our hands.\u201d\n\nMs. Sturgeon said an independent Scotland would \u201ccontinue to be part of the family of nations that make up the British Isles,\u201d and added, \u201cWe will work closely and cooperatively with our friends across these islands, but we\u2019ll do so on the basis of equality, we\u2019ll do so knowing that we\u2019re responsible for the decisions that shape our future.\u201d\n\nThe wide lead that the \"no\" side had in early opinion polls has appeared to narrow in recent weeks, to the point that the outcome has become too close to call. One survey earlier this month even found the \u201cyes\" campaign, led by Scotland\u2019s first minister, Alex Salmond, slightly ahead. That prompted the political elite in London to promise Scotland wider autonomy if voters reject independence.\n\nIn their letter on Tuesday, the three leaders \u2014 Mr. Cameron; Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats; and Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party \u2014 promised \u201cextensive new powers\u201d for the existing Scottish Parliament on a timetable beginning the day after the referendum.\n\nThey also pledged that the Scottish Parliament would determine Scotland\u2019s spending on the publicly financed National Health Service. But the letter did not go into detail.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Salmond\u2019s independence campaign said the three leaders were \u201cwilling to say anything in the last few days of the campaign to try to halt the 'yes' momentum \u2014 anything except what new powers, if any, they might be willing to offer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Salmond dismissed the promise of greater autonomy, originally put forth last week by Mr. Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s totally inadequate, it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Mr. Salmond said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing approaching the powers that Scotland needs to create jobs, to save the health service and build a better society.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
