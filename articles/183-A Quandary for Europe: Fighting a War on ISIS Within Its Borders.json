Most of the European terrorist suspects were known to the local police.\n\n\u201cThere is a realization that this is not a war you can bomb or shoot your way out of, but you have to deal with individuals who are radicalized at home, to examine the reasons that they are exploring this other identity,\u201d said Mr. Pantucci, who wrote a book on the issue: \u201cWe Love Death as You Love Life: Britain\u2019s Suburban Terrorists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nImportant pockets of the disenfranchised and isolated are embedded in most European countries, he said: Bradford in England, heavily Kashmiri and home to the London subway bombers of July 7, 2005; largely Muslim East Birmingham, where organized crime and radicalism spring from the same roots; and the heavily immigrant suburbs or banlieues of France\u2019s big cities.\n\nBelgium, already divided by language and with a plethora of local and state federalisms and police forces, provides a special example. More so than elsewhere, Belgium allowed the self-ghettoization, or self-isolation, of ethnic communities in the name of multiculturalism and peace.\n\n\u201cThere are parts of Europe, especially in France and Belgium, where over the past two decades you\u2019ve seen the emergence of essentially ungoverned spaces, nearly akin to Yemen or Libya,\u201d said Peter R. Neumann, director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King\u2019s College London. \u201cMolenbeek is one of them, a place where local authorities and even mainstream Muslim groups abandoned them, with an informal pact, that \u2018as long as we don\u2019t see you, we won\u2019t bother you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Resentment and alienation from the state meant that these groups \u201ccould enter and work without being hassled by the police but also found people open to their message.\u201d\n\nMr. Heisbourg said that the result was \u201ca disaster for counterterrorism.\u201d These were \u201cno-go areas for the authorities, who have found it very difficult to get informants and human intelligence,\u201d noting that many of the French citizens who carried out attacks in France lived or were hosted in Brussels neighborhoods like Molenbeek.\n\nIn per capita terms, more Belgians have left to fight with Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq than citizens of any other European country: As of last month, 441 had done so, according to data from the Belgian Ministry of Justice, and 117 have returned.\n\nPlaces like Molenbeek and Schaerbeek, where the bombs used on Tuesday were thought to have been constructed, have been problems for a long time, Mr. Pantucci said. \u201cOne question is whether more could have been or should have been done to understand the local problems and deal with them. Because left alone, over time there is an undercurrent of radical ideologies,\u201d radical preachers and recruitment networks, \u201cand getting rid of that is very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nSome political scientists, like Olivier Roy, a scholar of Islam at the European University Institute, say that Islam does not cause radicalization, but serves as the vehicle for radicalized anger from some Muslim youth.\n\nFor that, Europe has few easy answers, especially as the Islamic State seeks to manipulate European fears of terrorism and migration. Gilles Kepel, a French sociologist who has studied radical Islam and the banlieues, has argued that part of the Islamic State\u2019s intention is to mobilize fears of the \u201cenemy within,\u201d create further rejection of European Muslim citizens and radicalize them at home, to create a kind of civil war between European Muslims and the \u201ccrusader states.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn dealing with terrorism through denial of nationality, abuses of civil liberties or an indefinite state of emergency, Mr. Heisbourg warned that \u201cyou may create the conditions where you end up with the civil war in European societies that Daesh clearly wants.\u201d", "summary": "President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and his prime minister, Manuel Valls, have repeatedly described Europe\u2019s fight against the Islamic State as war; Mr. Heisbourg called that an \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d use of the word.\u201cThere are parts of Europe, especially in France and Belgium, where over the past two decades you\u2019ve seen the emergence of essentially ungoverned spaces, nearly akin to Yemen or Libya,\u201d said Peter R.
