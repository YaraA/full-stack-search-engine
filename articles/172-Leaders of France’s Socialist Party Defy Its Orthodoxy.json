Neither speaks much about redistributing wealth. But both are far more popular now than Mr. Hollande, who drew a 22 percent approval rating in a recent poll.\n\nThrough the late summer and early fall Mr. Macron has unapologetically launched pinpricks at Socialist dogma. In other contexts they would have appeared mild, but in France they have been incendiary.\n\nMr. Macron\u2019s sorties have provoked sputters of rage from tradition-minded activists and the party\u2019s still solid base, but the economy minister, a self-confident 37-year-old, keeps on talking.\n\nOn Tuesday, as Mr. Macron spoke at a conference in Lyon, a protester threw a yogurt pot at him, yelling: \u201cYou are murdering the unemployed!\u201d\n\nTwo op-ed columnists wrote recently in the newspaper Le Monde of \u201cthe disgust that the Macron-Valls axis inspires,\u201d asking, \u201cHow could the left have arrived at this point?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe answer, no doubt, derives from a political calculation of their boss, Mr. Hollande, who put them in place in a nod to his own unpopularity and lack of success in taking on his party\u2019s old guard.\n\nDespite the turbulence Mr. Macron and Mr. Valls have stirred, the president has shown no sign of reining in the two men, who may soon be serious political rivals. Mr. Hollande has pledged not to run for re-election if he cannot bring down unemployment.\n\nIf Mr. Macron and Mr. Valls represent a vision of the party\u2019s future, it is one seemingly out of step with the traditions of its past.\n\nMr. Macron appears more at ease with business leaders than workers, and through the criticism he has continued to address corporate executives and others who do not normally sit still for speeches from Socialist government ministers.\n\nMr. Valls, 53, was recently accused by a leading Socialist parliamentarian of being nothing more than a \u201cfount of liberal ideas\u201d \u2014 in the French context, a defender of free markets. He was forced to push through a signature piece of the government\u2019s economic agenda over the heads of his own legislators this year.\n\nAs the divisions within the party become ever more evident \u2014 and antagonistic \u2014 French analysts are having difficulty identifying what the Socialists actually stand for.\n\n\u201cThe governing party has neither a project nor intellectual consistency,\u201d Marcel Gauchet, a historian and philosopher, wrote last year in a leading political journal, Le D\u00e9bat. \u201cAt its top all ideological credibility has vanished.\u201d\n\nNor is it clear whom the left now represents, Mr. Gauchet said.\n\n\u201cIt prospered on its identification with \u2018the people,\u2019 \u201d he said in the review, which he edits. \u201cBut it is less and less of the working class.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe National Front, on the other hand, represents \u201cthe strongest synthesis in French politics,\u201d Mr. Gauchet said: \u201cthe confluence of nationalist claims and social welfare claims.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In a poll published Sunday, Ms. Le Pen drew 31 percent support in the 2017 presidential race.\n\nAlready, some analysts say the National Front could be unbeatable, having also left the conservative party led by former President Nicolas Sarkozy in early disarray.\n\nIn Le D\u00e9bat, Le Monde\u2019s national editor said this month of the National Front: \u201cI don\u2019t see what could stop it.\u201d\n\nThe contempt Ms. Le Pen showed Mr. Hollande to his face last week at the European Parliament in Strasbourg demonstrated her party\u2019s confidence and ascendancy.\n\nShe mockingly thanked the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also present, for \u201ccoming with your vice-chancellor administrator of province-France,\u201d Mr. Hollande.\n\nMr. Hollande did not address Ms. Le Pen\u2019s insult \u2014 a veiled reference to France\u2019s conquered status in World War II \u2014 directly. Ms. Le Pen then further mocked his response as \u201clightweight.\u201d\n\nIn their effort to restore the stature of their party and country, Mr. Valls and Mr. Macron have pushed forward a program closer to those of the Social Democratic parties of Europe than those of traditional Socialists.\n\nLast week, after workers publicly ripped the shirts off Air France executives in a labor dispute turned violent, Mr. Valls leapt up in Parliament.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut instead of defending the workers, he denounced them, saying their actions were \u201cintolerable,\u201d calling for \u201cexemplary punishments,\u201d and faulting the pilots\u2019 union for lack of \u201cresponsibility.\u201d\n\nTraditional left leaders, by contrast, defended the shirt rippers, who have since been arrested.\n\nLikewise, on Wednesday, Mr. Valls quickly moved to mollify angry police officers demonstrating over a recent shooting of one of their own, announcing new measures to strengthen law enforcement.\n\nMr. Macron, whose past as a banker at Rothschild and Company is a constant source of reproach for Socialist Party activists, upset them this year with an economic reform law that tried to open up some professions to greater competition and has yet to make much of an impact. And he has been at it again, upsetting them consistently since late August.\n\n\u201cThe left might have thought, some time ago, that France could do better in working less,\u201d Mr. Macron told an employers\u2019 federation, in an indirect reference to the 35-hour workweek, sacred to the left but derided by economists. \u201cAll of that is now behind us,\u201d Mr. Macron said.\n\nThen he infuriated the Socialist old guard by appearing to call into question the protected status of civil servants \u2014 \u201cno longer adapted to the world as it is,\u201d Mr. Macron was quoted as saying in a briefing meant to be off the record.\n\nHe has also been at war with the Socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, over opening up sections of the city to Sunday shopping, regarded warily by Socialists as an infringement on workers\u2019 rights and a cave-in to consumerism.\n\nMr. Macron\u2019s Sunday-shopping plans \u201creveal the fantasy of a city turned over entirely to tourist consumerism,\u201d Ms. Hidalgo wrote in a recent letter to the economy minister.\n\nOne of the staunchest of the old-line Socialist bosses, the mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, said she was \u201cfed up\u201d with the ex-banker who appears to have taken over the party\u2019s economic policy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the prime minister has backed him. And in the French Parliament, there has been silence: A movement in its ranks dedicated to fighting the free-market turn of government policy has barely uttered a word all fall.\n\nAt a meeting of producers and retailers of consumer goods, executives listened to Mr. Macron respectfully one morning recently.\n\nHe told the business leaders that the state would be watching over their negotiations, especially attentive to signs that competition was being hindered. But his message on the state\u2019s limits, not its powers, was strongest.\n\n\u201cThe role of the state is not to block initiatives,\u201d the economy minister said. \u201cThe state can\u2019t do everything, and it can\u2019t be in every negotiation.\u201d"}
