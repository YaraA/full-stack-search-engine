{"title": "Rift Forms in Germany Over Asylum", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/world/europe/rift-forms-in-germany-over-asylum.html", "body": "In April, about 426 migrants were living in parishes across Germany \u2014 more than three times as many as last year \u2014 according to Asylum in the Church, an ecumenical organization that helps parishes with legal and logistical questions. The practice began in Berlin in the 1980s, inspired by the Sanctuary Movement in the United States, in which churches sheltered immigrants from El Salvador and Guatemala.\n\nWhile the rise of anti-immigrant demonstrations and recent arson attacks at refugee shelters reflect some Germans\u2019 resistance to the arrival of more than 200,000 asylum-seekers last year, the tradition of church asylum represents another side of Germany.\n\nThe movement has infused Germany\u2019s Roman Catholic and Protestant churches with a newfound sense of social purpose, after years of losing members because of sex abuse scandals and growing secularism.\n\nBut the government, which has repeatedly called for Germans to welcome the refugees, considers the practice illegal and sees the recent explosion of church asylum cases as a rebuke to European policy.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be that church asylum is being used to criticize a difficult political situation,\u201d said Katrin Hirseland, a spokeswoman for Germany\u2019s federal office for migration and refugees.\n\nStephan Theo Reichel, a retired international businessman who counsels Lutheran parishes in Bavaria trying to take in asylum-seekers, said nonreligious Germans, mindful of the country\u2019s Nazi past, had supported church asylum cases out of a sense of political responsibility.\n\n\u201cGiven our history, we should be honored to help these people,\u201d Mr. Reichel said. \u201cWe should be proud that they come to us and should do more for them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe cases of Ali and Abdullah Zadran, the Afghan migrant who joined him in the St. Joseph apartment, are typical. The pair have been threatened with deportation to the country where they entered the European Union. They are so-called Dublin cases, named after the recently recast Dublin Regulation, which specifies responsibility for asylum claims across the 28-nation bloc.\n\nAli, who gave only his first name because he says he is a minor, and Mr. Zadran both entered through Bulgaria last year. Neither wants to go back there.\n\nMr. Zadran said he had spent two months in a Bulgarian jail, a common destination for migrants arriving without authorization in that country, then fled to Serbia. After 10 days in a Serbian prison, he was released, and he hid in a truck headed north, he said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHere, life good,\u201d Mr. Zadran, 21, said in a recent interview.\n\nThe asylum seekers\u2019 plight has put them squarely in the middle of growing tensions over Europe\u2019s handling of the many migrants fleeing conflicts and chaos in places like Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria, Iraq and western Africa. Last year, 570,800 claims for asylum were registered in the European Union, more than a third of them in Germany, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nWhether migrants travel on foot, as Ali and Mr. Zadran did, or in boats crossing the Mediterranean from Africa, many arrive in the countries on Europe\u2019s southern and eastern rims, only to find insufficient support and legal systems to process their applications for asylum. From there, they press north and west, into Europe\u2019s wealthier nations, such as Germany, Denmark or Sweden.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While Europe has adopted a common legal system for refugees, standards for housing and public benefits vary widely. Aid workers say complaints about overcrowding and new arrivals being beaten, jailed or left to fend for themselves are common in some countries, including Bulgaria, Hungary and Italy.\n\nThe German authorities are committed to the European policy. But asylum seekers who manage to remain in Germany for six months become eligible to apply for permanent asylum there, regardless of how they entered the European Union \u2014 which is why more migrants are confining themselves to church grounds, hoping to safely wait out that time period.\n\nAli said he fled Afghanistan on foot after the Taliban murdered his father. In Bulgaria, he spent nearly a month in jail, he said. When he arrived here, his one wish was for a tube of gel to style his hair. He claims that he is only 17, but German authorities who interviewed Ali estimated that he was older than 21.\n\nGerman law prevents deportation of unaccompanied minors, even to another European country. But the legal process to establish Ali\u2019s age could take months, and he was ordered to return to Bulgaria in December.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnly a third of those who applied for permanent asylum in Germany last year met the criteria. The others were ordered to leave or allowed to resubmit their applications.\n\nThe Rev. Dieter M\u00fcller, who runs the Jesuit Refugee Service for southern Germany, has helped settle dozens of asylum seekers in parishes across Bavaria. Like many in the church, he disputes the government\u2019s contention that the practice is illegal.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of a church asylum is to ensure a fair application to gain recognition as a refugee,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, Germany\u2019s interior minister, came under fire when, while saying no religious institution could be above the law, he compared Christians protecting asylum seekers with Muslims practicing a strict form of Islamic law.\n\nMr. de Maizi\u00e8re later retracted the statement and agreed to work with church leaders to evaluate extraordinary cases, before church asylum is considered necessary.\n\nFor Angelika Pfaffendorf, 65, a volunteer at St. Joseph who became a den mother for the two young Afghans, it is a simple matter of compassion.\n\nIn the months the young men spent in the church, she watched over their progress and made sure that Mr. Zadran got out of bed in the morning and left the apartment he shared with Ali.\n\nAfter psychological treatment for trauma, Mr. Zadran began taking part in life around the parish, shoveling snow, helping to set up and clear away chairs for meetings and taking daily lessons in German and basic math.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t go back to Bulgaria,\u201d Ms. Pfaffendorf said. \u201cHe would wind up on the street and slip into a life of petty crime.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter more than two months on the parish grounds, Mr. Zadran was granted the right to apply for permanent asylum in Germany.
