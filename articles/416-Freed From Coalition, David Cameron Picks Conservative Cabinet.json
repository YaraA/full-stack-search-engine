Tina Stowell, a baroness, remains leader of the House of Lords and assumes the status of a full member of the cabinet. Nicky Morgan remains education secretary.\n\nMr. Cameron also promoted Sajid Javid, considered by many to be a rising star in the party, to be business secretary. Mr. Javid, 45, is a former investment banker and the son of a bus driver. He was previously secretary for culture, media and sport, a portfolio that now goes to John Whittingdale.\n\nMark Harper, the former immigration minister, has been named chief whip, a crucial role in a government with a narrow majority in the House of Commons and many members whose views on immigration and Europe are well to the right of Mr. Cameron\u2019s.\n\nMichael Gove, the former chief whip and education secretary, who is close to Mr. Cameron, was appointed minister for justice. He replaced Chris Grayling, who will become leader of the House of Commons, succeeding William Hague, who did not run for re-election.\n\nThe secretary of state for Scotland will be David Mundell, the only Conservative to win a Scottish seat in Parliament last week.

At least 60 Conservative members of Parliament, and perhaps as many as 100, are in favor of Britain\u2019s leaving the union unless Mr. Cameron can deliver fundamental changes in Britain\u2019s terms of membership. He has promised to hold a referendum on the issue by 2017.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is also likely to be friction over how much autonomy to offer Scotland, and over some of the budget cuts Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne have promised.\n\nLegislators from the opposition Labour Party met on Monday as well, to lick their electoral wounds and discuss strategy. The party\u2019s leader, Ed Miliband, stepped down after the election, leaving a temporary replacement, Harriet Harman, to announce a shadow cabinet of 14 women and 15 men on Monday.\n\nMr. Miliband\u2019s brother David, whom he defeated for the leadership in 2010, said on Monday that he would not run for the post now. Speaking to the BBC from New York, where he heads the International Rescue Committee, a nongovernmental organization, David Miliband criticized the election campaign run by his brother as too narrow and unattractive to voters.\n\nThere was \u201cabsolutely no point in blaming the electorate\u201d for Labour\u2019s defeat, he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want what was being offered.\u201d\n\nDavid Miliband said his brother and Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, had \u201callowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, \u201cmany of the attacks on Ed were unpleasant and unfair, and I think he dealt with them with enormous dignity and with courage.\u201d\n\nAlan Sugar, a Labour member of the House of Lords and prominent donor to the party, announced on Monday that he was quitting the party in disgust at what he considered its antipathy toward business.\n\nOn the far right, the U.K. Independence Party on Monday rejected the resignation of its leader, Nigel Farage. Mr. Farage lost his bid for a seat in Parliament on Thursday and resigned on Friday, as he had promised to do.
