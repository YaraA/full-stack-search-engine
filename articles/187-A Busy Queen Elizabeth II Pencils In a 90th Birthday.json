(Her birthday is officially celebrated in June for ceremonial purposes.) A British artist has also paid tribute to her service as an Army mechanic during World War II by using 800 car parts to create a giant sculpture of the queen\u2019s head, including a crown made with spark plugs. There is a new set of stamps to honor the birthday, featuring four generations of royals, including little Prince George. They will be first class, of course.\n\nVideo\n\nRetailers and canny subjects are cashing in. Those who cannot afford the bespoke 22-karat gold \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d music box (retailing for $1,425) can buy a souvenir waistcoat emblazoned with the queen\u2019s image ($50, on eBay).\n\nIn a reflection of how multicultural Britain has become during her reign, Nadiya Hussain, a head scarf-wearing Muslim baker who won the BBC\u2019s wildly popular \u201cGreat British Bake Off,\u201d will prepare an orange drizzle birthday cake with orange curd and orange buttercream for the queen. (A 68-year-old slice of the queen\u2019s wedding cake fetched $719 at a September auction.)\n\nThe queen could be forgiven for showing emotion when she blows out her candles. But it is unlikely.\n\nVernon Bogdanor, an eminent constitutional scholar at King\u2019s College London, commended the queen for her self-restraint and for keeping her views to herself, arguing that the enigma of her persona has been essential to her success at symbolizing and unifying the nation.\n\n\u201cShe grew up during the war when people had to show emotional restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cNot like today when you have to let everything out.\u201d\n\nProfessor Bogdanor said he could recall only two gaffes by the queen: The first came on a trip to St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1994, when she evidently told a young Russian biologist, who had studied in Manchester, England, that the city was \u201cnot such a nice place.\u201d (Buckingham Palace denied it at the time.) More memorably, in 1997, the queen misread the public mood after Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris and initially remained in Balmoral, Scotland, with her grandsons, rather than returning to London to emote before a grieving nation.\n\nRetaining the sparkle of a creaking institution is not easy. Britons also recently got a rare glimpse inside the royal household in an ITV documentary \u201cOur Queen at 90,\u201d in which her subjects learned that her 2-year-old great-grandson, Prince George, calls her \u201cGan-Gan.\u201d His father, Prince William, second in line to the throne, noted that some people are so overwhelmed when they meet his grandmother that they faint.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBorn on April 21, 1926, Elizabeth was initially third in line to the throne. In 1947, she defied her parents to marry Prince Philip, who is part Danish and Greek; she was smitten when she saw him at age 13. She acceded to the throne in 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI; his older brother, King Edward VIII, had abdicated in 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, an American.\n\nThough the monarchy is associated with the class system, wealth and privilege, Peter York, a leading cultural commentator, argued that the queen\u2019s unbridled blandness was a form of \u201chuman bondage.\u201d Britons, he said, relished reports of her legendary thriftiness, including stories, apocryphal or not, that she roams Buckingham Palace turning off lights, enjoys soap operas and eats \u201cnonbanquet dinners out of Tupperware containers.\u201d In private, she is said to have a keen sense of humor.\n\n\u201cShe should be congratulated for living this long,\u201d Mr. York said. \u201cThe certainty of her life reminds Britons of the continuity of their own.\u201d\n\nMr. York said the queen could also display barely decipherable piques of annoyance, as when she asked in 2008, during a visit to the London School of Economics, why no one had foreseen the financial crisis, which had dented her wealth.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
