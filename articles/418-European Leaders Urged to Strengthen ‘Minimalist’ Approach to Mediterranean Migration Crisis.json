{"title": "European Leaders Urged to Strengthen \u2018Minimalist\u2019 Approach to Mediterranean Migration Crisis", "authors": ["Nick Cumming-Bruce"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/world/europe/european-leaders-urged-to-strengthen-minimalist-approach-to-mediterranean-migration-crisis.html", "body": "A European 10-point plan outlined at the start of the week called for enhanced search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean, but put the emphasis on border protection and action against traffickers rather than addressing the causes of the crisis or the plight of migrants.\n\n\u201cAs a paramount principle, the safety, protection needs, and human rights of all migrants and refugees should be at the forefront of the E.U. response,\u201d United Nations and International Organization for Migration officials said Thursday.\n\nApril is already the deadliest month on record in terms of migrant deaths. There have been more than 1,300 fatalities in the Mediterranean, bringing the total to more than 1,776 so far this year, the United Nations refugee agency has reported. This is roughly half the number who perished at sea in all of 2014.\n\n\u201cThe worry clearly is that the European response doesn\u2019t look as if it will be sufficient by a long way and we will see more deaths,\u201d said a United Nations official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. \u201cIf you think you can close the gates to people fleeing war and repression, then you are clinging to a fantasy.\u201d\n\nMore than 219,000 people crossed the Mediterranean seeking entry to Europe in 2014, a record. While the political discourse on migrants labels most as people seeking a better life, the United Nations refugee agency says half of them were fugitives from conflicts in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, mayhem in Somalia and an abusive dictatorship in Eritrea.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
