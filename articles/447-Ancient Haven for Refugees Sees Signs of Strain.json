Other refugees have taken on street trades in what they say is an attempt to preserve their dignity, but their efforts have created resentment from Turkish vendors who do not want the competition.\n\nThe Turkish government, an opponent of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, did not anticipate that the war in Syria would last this long. When Turkey opened its border to refugees in 2011, the government presumed that Mr. Assad\u2019s days were numbered and refugees would soon return home.\n\nNow Turkey faces its own security threats in an increasingly unstable region. There are jihadist fighters taking refuge on its border with Syria, and their extremist counterparts in Iraq have taken hostage dozens of Turkish diplomats. The influx of refugees is transforming the social fabric of major cities, sparking violent protests.\n\nIn one recent demonstration in Kahramanmaras, a city in southeast Turkey, knife-wielding demonstrators chanting, \u201cWe do not want Syrians!\u201d attacked Syrian shopkeepers.\n\nGovernment officials have started to acknowledge that the refugees will stay in Turkey for a while, but analysts say Turkey has no long-term strategy to accommodate them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe attacks against the refugees that we\u2019ve witnessed over the past few weeks are alarming and the government needs to take precautions, but that doesn\u2019t mean pulling the refugees out of cities and cramming them into the camps,\u201d said Piril Ercoban, the administrative coordinator of the Association for Solidarity with Refugees, a Turkish nongovernmental organization. \u201cSending people to these camps by force and isolating them from society is against human rights, and though it may sound harsh, such actions are starting to make these camps look like concentration camps.\u201d\n\nIn some low-income neighborhoods in Istanbul\u2019s historic Fatih district, refugees are working illegally, and large extended families live in tiny apartments. Mustafa Shihabi, 30, lives with 16 family members and guests in a three-room apartment.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His two brothers, the only other family members to have found work, have been able to pay only half their $750 monthly rent.\n\n\u201cLast month my boss didn\u2019t pay me,\u201d Mr. Shihabi said. \u201cHe shut down his workshop and left for Adana without any explanation. Our landlord is annoyed and told us that if we don\u2019t pay up we\u2019ll be kicked out without notice.\u201d\n\nRUSSIA bulgARIA Black Sea GEORGIA Istanbul TURKEY Kahramanmaras SYRIA IRAQ Mediterranean Sea 250 miles\n\nMr. Shihabi\u2019s anxiety is shared by his family and the many refugees here who, without the protection of Turkish labor laws, are vulnerable.\n\n\u201cI hear they are going to send people back to the camps. Is that true?\u201d asked Mr. Shihabi\u2019s father, Adnan, who described the camps as prisons. Mr. Shihabi tried to reassure his father, telling him the government\u2019s efforts are directed at the beggars.\n\nOutside the apartment, life plays out harmoniously for the Turks and the refugees, but some locals are skeptical that the peace can be sustained.\n\n\u201cThe Syrians are good people, but it\u2019s hard to tolerate 32 people sharing one room,\u201d said Cemal Nazlica, a Turkish furniture store owner, who said the refugees would be better off in the camps. \u201cThey make too much noise and have a long way to go to learn our ways,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile Mr. Nazlica sat on his doorstep reading a newspaper, two of Mr. Shihabi\u2019s relatives walked by complaining about the expensive produce that they had bought in the local market.\n\n\u201cEvery day you have to spend money in Istanbul,\u201d said Saniha Adbad, 54. \u201cAt least at the camps everything is free. In Syria I had a job. I was a tailor and my wallet was bursting with money.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow look what I have,\u201d she said, pulling out a 10-cent piece from her pocket. \u201cNothing.\u201d"}
