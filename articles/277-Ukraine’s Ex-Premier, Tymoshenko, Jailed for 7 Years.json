On one hand, Mr. Yanukovich has defied intense diplomatic pressure from Western partners, crossing what one analyst called \u201cthe reddest of red lines.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Ukraine has been under pressure from Russia to join its own economic bloc, along with Kazakhstan and Belarus . Even compared with the other former Soviet nations, Ukraine \u2014 with a population of 46 million \u2014 seems to waver between Europe and Russia, so that isolating it from the West could have profound consequences.\n\nMr. Yanukovich has made integrating with Europe a central goal, and he is likely to head off catastrophic damage by softening Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s conviction swiftly. One route to this would be decriminalizing the article under which she was convicted. In that event, her name would be cleared and she would be able to run in parliamentary elections in 2012, said Serhiy Vlasenko, one of her lawyers. This could occur as soon as next week, so that Mr. Yanukovich would be welcome at European Union talks in Brussels scheduled for Oct. 20.\n\nHe suggested as much on Tuesday, when he told journalists, \u201cThis is not a final decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cAhead lies the appeals court, and it will without a doubt make a decision within the bounds of the law, but the decision will have great significance,\u201d he said, in comments carried by the Interfax news agency.\n\nIn Brussels, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister emphasized the progress that the country has made toward meeting European benchmarks, saying the parties \u201chave never been so close to the association agreement as they are now.\u201d A Foreign Ministry statement argued strenuously against linking the Tymoshenko verdict with the European Union procedure, making the case that political leaders like Mr. Yanukovich could not interfere in judicial processes. As news of the verdict spread on Tuesday, though, some in Kiev said Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s conviction was already marked in Ukraine\u2019s history.\n\nCritics of the verdict warned that Ukraine could follow the pattern set by Belarus, whose nascent engagement with the West came to an abrupt end last year amid a crackdown on opposition figures.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cFor the past 10 years, we were in the process of getting to a democratic state,\u201d said Yulia Shcherban, a travel agent. \u201cI agree that people who are dishonest must be charged. But in Ukraine, we are going back in the opposite direction and getting back to the days of the Soviet state: Either you are with those in power or you are against them and you are in trouble. She was against those in power.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCriticism came from a range of foreign capitals on Tuesday. Poland \u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying, \u201cUkraine\u2019s image as a country that is undertaking a fundamental pro-European transformation has been tarnished.\u201d The White House released a statement urging Ukraine to release Ms. Tymoshenko and other jailed political leaders, and to allow them to run in next year\u2019s parliamentary elections. Catherine Ashton , the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, said the trial \u201cunfortunately confirms that justice is being applied selectively in politically motivated prosecutions of the leaders of the opposition and members of the former government.\u201d\n\nRussia, too, condemned the verdict in Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s case \u2014 in part because her conviction centered on a deal she struck with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin in 2009, agreeing to pay what prosecutors called an excessively high price for Russian natural gas. Russian analysts said Ukraine might be trying to annul Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s gas deal and renegotiate for a better price.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the case is unlikely to mobilize the throngs that coalesced around Ms. Tymoshenko in 2004, when, dressed in the style of an unusually glamorous peasant woman, she became the face of the pro-Western Orange Revolution.\n\nThe euphoria faded over the next few years, as the members of the Orange coalition bickered endlessly among themselves and Ukraine\u2019s economy foundered. During the last presidential election, Ms. Tymoshenko struggled to engage her voting base \u2014 Ukrainian speakers from the west of the country \u2014 and lost narrowly to Mr. Yanukovich, who represents the more Russified east."}
