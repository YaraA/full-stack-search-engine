We are completely polarized as a society, and some of us are triumphant, some of us are worried. Still, a majority don\u2019t care much, as they are uninterested in politics and despise politicians.\n\nI am worried that the actions of the government will weaken our international position and hurt our relations with the E.U. This, in turn, will make it much easier for Russia to expand, once again, its influence over Central Europe.\n\nAdam Sienko in Warsaw, 26\n\nSports journalist\n\nWbrew pozorom ca\u0142kiem sporo si\u0119 zmieni\u0142o. Ludzie powariowali i temat\u00f3w politycznych trzeba unika\u0107 jak ognia. Wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 takich rozm\u00f3w ko\u0144czy si\u0119 k\u0142\u00f3tniami, a do dyskusji o sytuacji w Polsce wszyscy nabrali ostatnio wyj\u0105tkowej ochoty. Pierwszy raz w \u017cyciu jestem autentycznie zm\u0119czony polityk\u0105 i uciekam od niej jak tylko mog\u0119.\n\nContrary to appearances, a lot has changed. People have gone crazy and political subjects need to be avoided at all costs. Most political discussions end with fights, but somehow, people have recently acquired a taste for debates about Poland. For the first time in my life, I am tired of politics, and I try to escape it as much as I can.\n\nPhoto\n\nReminders of Hard-Earned Freedoms\n\nGrzegorz Zielinski in Warsaw, 41\n\nPsychotherapist\n\nIt makes me remember the Communist era. Government saying that everything is right, when thousands on the streets and experts say the opposite. For the first time since 26 years of freedom, I and my friends are worried about our democracy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichal Madey in Chorzow, 33\n\nOperations manager for Cisco\n\n\n\nI voted for PiS because I believe that Poland is still in the process of transforming from Communism and they are the ones who can finish this process. Eighty percent of our law is written in Brussels. We are being lectured on \u201cdemocracy\u201d by unelected commissars from the E.U. Polish people value liberty above all, and we want to decide on our own. PiS is far from perfect, but the best option yet. Foreign governments will not accept our democratic choices as they affect the interests of many foreign corporations who invest in Poland.\n\nBikes and Vegetarians\n\nTomasz Surdykowski in Krakow, 32\n\nTranslator and Ph.D. student in French literature\n\n\n\nAs a translator working with E.U. documents and someone who has to care much about words, I feel oppressed by the sheer stupidity of the statements of our current government. Our minister of transport is deeply concerned about chemtrails. Our minister of foreign affairs considers riding a bike and being vegetarian as Marxist. And to add insult to injury, there is also the unbelievable insolence. A former Communist prosecutor is leading the efforts to dismantle the Constitutional Court. A guy involved in the financial schemes now presides the Finance Commission in the Senate. I have stopped listening to the radio and reading newspapers.\n\nMaria Pawlikowska in Krakow, 30\n\nCopywriter in a communications studio\n\nI feel completely alone. I\u2019m a vegan, a cyclist and an atheist. There is no place for me here anymore. I can\u2019t watch my favorite TV station anymore, the budget in my city is lost due to World Youth Day. We want more bike paths and an Erasmus program! They steal our rights and a diversity rooted in Polish history.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

I was born in 1993 and have lived my whole life in a free, democratic country, and I want it to stay this way.\n\nMichal Szostak, Szczecin, 27\n\nCustomer-service consultant and apprentice blacksmith\n\nI am not a fan of PiS, I have not voted for them, but I see major improvement in the quality of public debate in television. Topics that were silenced are now being mentioned even in major news programs (such as Middle Eastern immigration to Europe, anti-E.U. views, etc.).\n\nPhoto\n\nRise of Civil Society\n\nTomasz Chmielewski in Warsaw, 26\n\nBrand marketing specialist\n\nNigdy nie przypuszcza\u0142em, \u017ce b\u0119d\u0119 bra\u0142 udzia\u0142 w demonstracjach w obronie demokracji. Do tej pory widzia\u0142em takie demonstracje tylko w telewizji \u2014 we wschodniej Europie oraz w archiwach z czas\u00f3w PRL-u. Nie spodziewa\u0142em si\u0119, \u017ce Polska, kt\u00f3ra by\u0142a wzorem dla Europy w walce o demokracj\u0119, mo\u017ce w pewnym momencie t\u0119 demokracj\u0119 zacz\u0105\u0107 traci\u0107.\n\nI never imagined that I would be taking part in demonstrations in defense of democracy. So far, I have seen such things only on television \u2014 in Eastern Europe or in historical records from the time of the Polish People\u2019s Republic. I never expected that Poland, which used to be a European role model in the fight for democracy, at some point could start losing this democracy itself.\n\nCezary Michalski in Szczecin, 16\n\nHigh school student\n\nPoland has changed a lot since the Law and Justice Party came to power, mostly for the worse. However, there is one positive thing \u2014 the rise of civic society, which is something we never truly had in the past. Our country has been through a lot in the past, and we as a nation have shown that we will fight for our freedom and values we believe in.\n\nPhoto\n\nFear of the Foreign\n\nJan Krol in Poznan, 25\n\nPh.D. student in paleontology\n\nI hope that the new government will work on restoring the Polish economy based on our own production. Now, most of the factories in Poland are similar to those in the Far East \u2014 places where people assemble products for big foreign companies, very cheaply.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMark Hall in Krakow, 58\n\nBass player for \u201cLos Gasolineros,\u201d a band of expatriates\n\n\n\nMany of my friends who have never shown an interest in politics are suddenly paying very close attention. The changes here are alarming, and the mounting xenophobia a source of concern to expats who have made their home here.\n\nFear of Exclusion\n\nKatarzyna Andrzejewska in Warsaw, 23\n\nStudent, teacher of foreign languages\n\nJako osoba w homoseksualnym zwi\u0105zku boj\u0119 si\u0119 o moje \u017cycie i wolno\u015b\u0107. Boj\u0119 si\u0119 trzyma\u0107 moj\u0105 ukochan\u0105 za r\u0119k\u0119 na ulicy, boimy si\u0119 m\u00f3wi\u0107 g\u0142o\u015bno o naszym zwi\u0105zku. Boimy si\u0119 przede wszystkim pobicia. Utrudnione jest dzia\u0142anie organizacji broni\u0105cych praw os\u00f3b LGBT, ca\u0142a spo\u0142eczno\u015b\u0107 homoseksualna w Polsce boi si\u0119, czy zmiany w Polsce nie przynios\u0105 tak\u017ce ustawy antygejowskiej, takiej jak w Rosji.\n\nAs a homosexual, I am afraid for my life and my freedom. I am afraid to hold my girlfriend\u2019s hand in the street. We are afraid to talk about our relationship in public. Mostly, we are afraid of being beaten up. It has become harder for L.G.B.T. rights organizations to work. The entire gay community in Poland is afraid that these recent changes in Poland might also bring an anti-gay law \u2014 similar to the one in Russia.\n\nPhoto\n\nEuropean Union\n\nRafal Panasiuk in Biala Podlaska, 27\n\nConstruction worker\n\nW moim codziennym \u017cyciu nie zmieni\u0142o si\u0119 kompletnie nic. Pracuj\u0119 i \u017cyj\u0119 jak dotychczas. Poziom mojej zamo\u017cno\u015bci tak\u017ce pozostaje bez zmian. Nie g\u0142osowa\u0142em ani na PiS, ani na PO, aczkolwiek kibicuj\u0119 obecnemu rz\u0105dowi. Dodatkowo podoba mi si\u0119 \u201cpolityka podniesionej g\u0142owy\u201d wobec zachodniej UE. Mog\u0119 te\u017c \u015bmia\u0142o powiedzie\u0107, \u017ce za rz\u0105d\u00f3w premiera Tuska m\u00f3j poziom \u017cycia znacz\u0105co si\u0119 obni\u017cy\u0142. Aby nie straci\u0107 p\u0142ynno\u015bci finansowej, musia\u0142em wyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0107 do Wielkiej Brytanii w celach zarobkowych. Dlatego w\u0142a\u015bnie dla przeci\u0119tnego Polaka najlepszym premierem ostatnich lat by\u0142 Tony Blair, kt\u00f3ry otworzy\u0142 dla nas rynek pracy.\n\nIn my everyday life, nothing has changed. I work and live just as I used to. I voted neither for Law and Justice nor for Civic Platform, but I root for the new government. In addition, I like the politics of \u201cthe head held high\u201d in regard to the Western European Union. I can also say that under the rule of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, my quality of life was significantly lowered. To maintain financial stability, I had to emigrate to Britain to work. That\u2019s why the best prime minister for an average Pole was Tony Blair, who opened up the British market for us.\n\nAngelika Ciszewska in Krakow, 32\n\nFreight forwarder at a transport company\n\nW ko\u0144cu dostrzegam szans\u0119, \u017ce przestaniemy by\u0107 \u201cpieskiem\u201d Niemiec. Polska to od wiek\u00f3w kraj katolicki z warto\u015bciami, kt\u00f3re zdaj\u0105 si\u0119 by\u0107 niewygodne dla liberalnej UE. Je\u015bli ten rz\u0105d nie ugnie si\u0119 pod presj\u0105 zachodnich polityk\u00f3w, b\u0119d\u0119 spa\u0142a spokojnie. Reasumuj\u0105c, w warunkach materialnych nic si\u0119 nie zmieni\u0142o, natomiast na pewno dzi\u015b bardziej czuj\u0119 si\u0119 Polk\u0105.\n\nFinally, I am seeing a chance for Poland to stop being Germany\u2019s \u201clittle dog.\u201d For centuries, Poland has been a Catholic country with values that seem to be disturbing for the liberal European Union. If this government does not cave to the pressure exerted by western politicians, I will sleep peacefully.", "summary": "Wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 takich rozm\u00f3w ko\u0144czy si\u0119 k\u0142\u00f3tniami, a do dyskusji o sytuacji w Polsce wszyscy nabrali ostatnio wyj\u0105tkowej ochoty.
