Ninety people died at the music hall that evening.\n\nCalmly, soberly, and with a photographer\u2019s eye for detail, Mr. Fritz recently sat down in a cafe here and recounted an awful intimacy \u2014 he referred to the terrorists by their first names \u2014 with the men whose bloody rampage killed 130 people across the city and continues to shake this country.\n\nThe terrorists threatened to kill him, asked him about his political views, appeared to lose interest when he told them he was Chilean, and finally \u2014 to his astonishment \u2014 spared him and the others.\n\n\u201cThis is a question that continues to bother me,\u201d Mr. Fritz said. \u201cEven when the police launched their assault, they didn\u2019t try to kill us. There had been exchanges, something that reminded them of humanity \u2014 so they didn\u2019t kill us. As my brother said, they were replete with death.\u201d\n\nMr. Fritz had been on the Bataclan\u2019s second floor balcony when the killing started. Very quickly he realized what was going on. The bodies had begun to pile up in the pit. \u201cThe odor of blood and gunpowder, very strange,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe attempted to call the police emergency number on his cellphone, but there was no answer. Still, he has nothing but praise for the police that night. \u201cSuperhumans,\u201d Mr. Fritz called them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In vain. Hanging from the window, high above the street, he was sure that night was his last. \u201cHow am I going to die?\u201d Mr. Fritz recalled asking himself. \u201cWill I fall?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the terrorists saw him and ordered him to climb back in, saying that \u201che had just killed 100 people and one more would not make any difference.\u201d Mr. Fritz complied.\n\n\u201cI came down from the window and I remember looking into his eyes, and he had beautiful blue eyes, blue like the sky, there was something magnificent about his eyes. The Kalashnikov was big. He said, \u2018Do you believe in God? Where is your God now?\u2019 \u201d\n\nOne asked him his nationality, and when Mr. Fritz replied that he was Chilean, \u201cthere was something that was extinguished in their look, because I was a foreigner. He said, \u2018But you have an opinion about French politics?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, no, no.\u2019 For them, it was legitimate to have that kind of dialogue.\u201d\n\nAs the two remaining terrorists worked to assemble their hostages, a police officer from the Brigade Anti-Criminalit\u00e9 killed one of them. And that completely changed the situation inside the Bataclan.\n\n\u201cI thought we were going to be killed,\u201d Mr. Fritz said. \u201cBut the behavior of the terrorists changed. We became a burden to them. They lost their footing.\u201d\n\nDespite the change in mood, he said, the ending to the horrific night felt just as tense.\n\nThe terrorists ordered the hostages at gunpoint into a service corridor, behind a door, Mr. Fritz recalled. The gunmen wanted to speak with the news media. They took a cellphone from one of the hostages, and forced some against the windows as shields.\n\nThe hostages could hear noises on the other side of the locked door, and they knew the police were there. Two women were ordered to place themselves against the door, additional human shields. Tense minutes of exchanges on the cellphone followed, but \u201cthere was no negotiation. There was nothing to negotiate,\u201d Mr. Fritz recalled.\n\n\u201cI knew there was going to be an intervention\u201d by the police, he said. \u201cAnd I knew it was going to be complicated. There was only one entrance to that corridor.\u201d\n\nThe door began to shake, and fall in, Mr. Fritz recalled. The terrorists were at the end of the corridor, and the police fired at them. Remarkably, in the chaos of bullets and explosions, none of the hostages were killed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI salute the professionalism of the BRI,\u201d Mr. Fritz said, referring to the police. \u201cThey came in, and they did not kill anybody, they did not wound anybody.\u201d", "summary": "Calmly, soberly, and with a photographer\u2019s eye for detail, Mr. Fritz recently sat down in a cafe here and recounted an awful intimacy \u2014 he referred to the terrorists by their first names \u2014 with the men whose bloody rampage killed 130 people across the city and continues to shake this country.
