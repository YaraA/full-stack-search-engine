This month, as many as 25,000 people showed up in Dresden for its weekly marches, while tens of thousands of others have turned out across Germany to counter its anti-immigration message.\n\nBut as the Pegida movement \u2014 and the backlash \u2014 swelled, and interest in its rallies picked up, the group\u2019s leadership crumbled under increased scrutiny, and the nascent movement may be waning.\n\nA statement on Pegida\u2019s website said its spokeswoman, Kathrin Oertel, needed a \u201ctimeout\u201d from the barrage of media attention that has accelerated since the rallies picked up followers and national and international interest. Thomas Tallacker, another member of Pegida\u2019s leadership and a former member of the City Council in Meissen, near Dresden, needed to devote himself more fully to his struggling business, the statement added. German news media reported that three more of the movement\u2019s leaders had resigned."}
