Of those, 13 are dead, and most of the rest are in custody. A handful have been released but are subject to conditions, like daily check-ins at a police station.\n\nOthers are probably lying low or on the run. What worries investigators is that many of the participants in the Paris-Brussels network were recruited by a preacher in the Brussels district of Molenbeek, Khalid Zerkani. He was tried twice in Belgium, accused of recruiting more than 50 young men to join the fight in Syria and helping to finance their journey to the Middle East. Many of those recruits were also named in those trials and tried in absentia.\n\n\u201cThere are still many people involved who were part of the Zerkani network, who were convicted in absentia \u2014 at least five to 10 \u2014 and we don\u2019t know where they are or what they might do,\u201d Mr. Brisard said.\n\nWhile they could turn out to be minor players, they could also emerge as able organizers of new assaults. Among Mr. Zerkani\u2019s recruits, prosecutors say, were Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the on-the-ground commander of the Paris attacks, and Reda Kriket, who was arrested on March 24 in a suburb of Paris. Mr. Kriket has been accused of being in the final stages of planning an attack in France involving \u201can arsenal of weapons and explosives of an unprecedented size,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Molins, the Paris prosecutor.\n\nFrom the ammunition and material found it appears that a highly lethal attack was averted. Mr. Kriket had Kalashnikov assault rifles, a submachine gun, pistols, ammunition and four boxes containing thousands of small steel balls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFour men in touch with Mr. Kriket, who were arrested in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, had in their possession 45 kilograms of ammunition, according to the Dutch Public Broadcaster, NOS. That is enough ammunition for 2,500 rounds, which is enough to supply as many as a dozen gunmen with multiple magazines.\n\nMr. Kriket\u2019s connection to the Paris and Brussels cells that carried out the attacks in those cities was not clear, and experts have differing views, but it raises the possibility that there are other, similar cells in France and Belgium as well as farther afield.\n\n\u201cThe cells are kept quite separate,\u201d said Claude Moniquet, a former French intelligence officer who now works in Belgium.\n\nHe added that so far investigators had not learned much about Mr. Kriket either from Salah Abdeslam, who prosecutors say was the only one of the 10 men directly involved in the Paris attacks to survive, or from Mr. Abrini, who was arrested on Friday and is accused of being involved in the logistics for the Paris attacks. Prosecutors say Mr. Abrini has also acknowledged accompanying the two suicide bombers at the Brussels airport.\n\nWestern intelligence and counterterrorism officials say their working assumption is that there are Islamic State networks in two or more European countries in addition to those in France and Belgium.\n\n\u201cOther Islamic State cells are highly likely to be in existence across Western Europe, preparing and organizing further operations, and awaiting direction from the group\u2019s central leadership to execute,\u201d said Matthew Henman, the head of IHS Jane\u2019s Terrorism and Insurgency Center in London.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

About 1,800 people have left or tried to leave France to fight in Syria and Iraq, according to recent statements by Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister. An additional 450 have gone to those countries from Belgium, according to estimates by analysts in Europe.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday that the Islamic State had aimed to strike France again came from the Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office. \u201cNumerous elements in the investigation have shown that the terrorist group initially had the intention to strike in France again,\u201d the office said in a statement.\n\n\u201cEventually, surprised by the speed of the progress in the ongoing investigation, they urgently took the decision to strike in Brussels,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn the attacks in the two capitals, a total of 162 people died and 753 were wounded.", "summary": "It adds up to a long road ahead in Europe for law enforcement and intelligence agencies but also for citizens who are having to learn to adapt to an array of new security precautions and more intrusive surveillance, especially in public places.Mr. Kriket has been accused of being in the final stages of planning an attack in France involving \u201can arsenal of weapons and explosives of an unprecedented size,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Molins, the Paris prosecutor.\u201cOther Islamic State cells are highly likely to be in existence across Western Europe, preparing and organizing further operations, and awaiting direction from the group\u2019s central leadership to execute,\u201d said Matthew Henman, the head of IHS Jane\u2019s Terrorism and Insurgency Center in London.Officials believed that the Islamic State had developed an overarching network of facilitators in Europe over the last few years to buy weapons, rent cars and reserve hotel rooms for teams of operatives who had previously traveled to, or were returning from, Iraq or Syria.The Islamic State\u2019s threats are in some ways easier to fulfill in France and Belgium than elsewhere because of the large number of French-speaking foreign fighters, many of whom are European citizens from those countries."}
