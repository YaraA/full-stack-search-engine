Why does everybody always say that the economy will benefit from a big stream of migrants, while there is in fact already a very high unemployment rate of well-educated people? \u2014 Reiner, Brussels, Belgium\n\n\n\nA. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, included the benefits of migration for the European economy in his State of the Union speech to the European Parliament last month. He described Europe as \u201can aging continent in demographic decline\u201d in need of \u201ctalent,\u201d and said migration could be \u201ca well-managed resource.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that overall unemployment across the European Union remains stubbornly high at nearly 10 percent. The rate among those with tertiary levels of education is lower: 6.6 percent in the 19 eurozone countries and 5.5 percent across the European Union, according to officials at Eurostat, the bloc\u2019s statistical office.\n\nEven so, Mr. Juncker\u2019s assertion does seem to support the views of some economists and migration experts who argue that migration can help drive economic activity, growth and employment in some countries.\n\nProviding education and skills will be crucial, those experts say.\n\nIn a policy paper in May 2014, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental think tank in Paris, said that getting migrants jobs would be the most important factor in determining how much they would pay into, or receive from, the state.\n\nAsk Us Your Questions About the Refugee Crisis in Europe What would you like to know about the refugee crisis in Europe? * You have 250 characters left.

He added that \u201cupskilling adult arrivals may also contribute, but the net impact is more difficult to assess.\u201d\n\n\u2014 JAMES KANTER\n\nQ. For how long is Europe willing to take in refugees, and how many? Is this an open-ended commitment that could last until the population of the Middle East and Africa has migrated to Europe? \u2014 Sandy Belkin, Bellmore, N.Y.\n\nA. The 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which for many years applied only to Europe, says that signatories to the convention have the obligation to take in all those fleeing a clear danger of persecution or threat to their lives from war or other dangers.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has said repeatedly that there is no limit on how many refugees Europe could or should absorb \u2014 at least in theory. But as Ms. Merkel and certainly some of her critics have also said, there is a practical limit to the number of people that can be effectively absorbed over a short period.\n\nThe entire population of the Middle East or Africa could not emigrate to Europe. But large numbers of people are expected to be on the move as long as the war in Syria persists. And there are other causes of the mass migration we\u2019re witnessing. In August, the United Nations predicted that Africa would add 1.3 billion people by 2050. That is about the current population of China. Economic growth is also predicted for Africa, but it\u2019s uncertain that this growth will be sufficient to support the continent\u2019s inhabitants, forcing many to move elsewhere in search of work.\n\nEurope, by contrast, is getting older. Germany is among the European countries with a rapidly aging population, and Ms. Merkel has long noted that Europeans cannot expect to retain their current living standards if the Continent has just 7 percent of the world\u2019s population but accounts for 50 percent of global expenditures on welfare.\n\n\u2014 ALISON SMALE", "summary": "In a policy paper in May 2014, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental think tank in Paris, said that getting migrants jobs would be the most important factor in determining how much they would pay into, or receive from, the state.Germany, with an overall jobless rate below 5 percent (and a jobless rate of 2.3 percent for those with tertiary education), should be able to integrate new arrivals into its work force as long as those people lacking qualifications and skills receive sufficient training, according to Matthias Busse, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels.Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.But the long-term effects on Europe\u2019s economy are less clear because of a range of variables like skills, success at integration and the average age of immigrants and asylum seekers.\u201cYoung migrants will profit from our education system and they still have a full work life to contribute to the welfare state,\u201d Mr. Busse said."}
