Legal uncertainty over how to define \u201cthe unborn\u201d has long dogged the amendment, and the assembly was seen as one response to the panel\u2019s criticisms.\n\nIt is common for women in Ireland to travel to countries such as Britain and the Netherlands for abortions. Figures from Britain\u2019s National Health Service showed that more than 3,400 women gave Irish addresses to British abortions clinics in 2015.\n\nThat said, Ireland remains a conservative society, and the Roman Catholic Church opposes any change in the law. \u201cWe believe that every unborn child, irrespective of his or her medical condition or the circumstances of his or her birth, has the right to be treated equally before the law,\u201d the bishops\u2019 conference said in a statement.\n\nSubmissions posted online expressed a wide range of views, with many of them offering deeply personal perspectives.\n\nLeslie Spillane, a woman in her 20s from Cork, in southwestern Ireland, wrote that several of her friends had traveled abroad to terminate their pregnancies.\n\n\u201cThese friends of mine are also the lucky ones, they have been able to borrow the money for the travel, and they have had friends they could tell,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAbortions happen, everyday. Making them illegal doesn\u2019t stop woman needing, or wanting them, or inflicting them on themselves \u2014 there will always be coat hangers, broken bottles, painkillers, stairs to fall down, fists to hit, medicines to swallow.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In 1992, voters approved an amendment to the Constitution to allow women to travel abroad for abortions and to receive information about abortion services abroad. And in that year, and again in 2002, voters rejected amendments that would have removed the threat of suicide as grounds for a legal abortion.\n\nConor O\u2019Mahony, a lecturer in law at University College Cork, says the continued contentiousness reveals problems with the wording of the ban.\n\n\u201cThe Eighth Amendment doesn\u2019t work as a means of regulating abortion, whether you are coming from the anti-abortion or abortion rights perspective,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd the evidence I would give you is that neither side has ever been happy with how that amendment has been interpreted and applied over the years.\u201d\n\nHe said that public opinion had been gradually shifting in favor of legalizing abortion \u2014 particularly in cases involving severe fetal abnormalities or rape \u2014 but predicted that the debate would continue for years even if a referendum was to take place in the near future.\n\nGerard Whyte, a professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, said in a phone interview that it would be unwise to simply repeal the amendment, as some abortion-rights advocates seek.\n\n\u201cIf there is no constitutional protection for the unborn, then there is a problem and we\u2019re into uncharted territory,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m simply warning about a situation whereby people decide to repeal the Eighth but don\u2019t add anything else.\u201d"}
