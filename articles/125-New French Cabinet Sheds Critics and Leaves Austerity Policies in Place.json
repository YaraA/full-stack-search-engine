{"title": "New French Cabinet Sheds Critics and Leaves Austerity Policies in Place", "authors": ["Liz Alderman", "Dan Bilefsky"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/world/europe/france-new-government.html", "body": "And he named Emmanuel Macron, 36, a former investment banker at Rothschild and a deputy secretary general at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace who has been a close adviser to Mr. Hollande on economic policies, as the new economy minister, replacing Mr. Montebourg.\n\nYet in a sign that Mr. Valls is seeking to ensure his party\u2019s backing, he asked Parliament on Tuesday to hold a rare vote of confidence in the new government in September or October. \u201cThe majority will have to be there,\u201d he said of the vote in an interview on French television. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a majority, it\u2019s over \u2014 we cannot continue.\u201d\n\nBoth men were expected to press ahead with Mr. Hollande\u2019s economic program, including a package of spending cuts totaling 50 billion euros, or $66 billion, through 2017, and a package of tax measures for employers designed to stoke hiring.\n\nThe moves appeared to trim the ideological breadth of the cabinet at the expense of the left. But analysts expected that would do little to alter the course Mr. Hollande has plotted in trying to keep his party with him while also appeasing European Union officials who want countries to mend their public finances by reducing budgets.\n\nMr. Hollande has tried to walk a line between the two camps, and watched his public standing dwindle. His policies have stoked ire from both the left and from French businesses and international investors, who say he has not gone far enough to revive the nation\u2019s competitiveness.\n\nIf nothing else, the crisis has made more apparent the competing forces that have tugged at Mr. Hollande since the beginning of his term in 2012. It has also highlighted the limited policy tools available to him in an atmosphere, in France and in much of the rest of Europe, of high public debt, persistent unemployment and stagnant growth that threatens to transform the five-year euro crisis into a chronic economic illness.\n\nAnalysts said they expected the new government to push ahead with more of Mr. Hollande\u2019s austerity measures, which were necessary to help reduce France\u2019s deficit. Critics say the measures have thwarted an economic recovery after nearly a year of stagnant growth and high unemployment, which hovers above 10 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPolitically, the early judgments on the reshuffling were gloomy as jockeying began for the next presidential elections in 2017, cementing Mr. Hollande\u2019s image as an ineffective politician who now faces the added risk of seeing his party base further erode.\n\nSimon Tilford, an economist who is deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute in London, said that the latest French political crisis would invariably also diminish Mr. Hollande in Brussels in favor of Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel. It was her insistence on austerity that helped spur the divisions that led to the French crisis.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He is better versed in the nuances of European politics, having gotten his start in the early 1990s, when, as finance minister under President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, also a Socialist, he managed the referendum campaign to persuade the French to join in the creation of the euro.\n\nWhile Mr. Montebourg had warned that the austerity program would only suppress a recovery, others said it was important for the president to make some progress in curbing runaway government spending.\n\n\u201cFifty billion in three years is massive for France, so it\u2019s a positive sign that Mr. Hollande is committed to continuing what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Famke Krumbm\u00fcller, a Europe analyst at the Eurasia Group in London. \u201cThe only alternative would be to do much less to please the left wing of his party.\u201d\n\nWith growth so tepid, Mr. Sapin has already warned France\u2019s European partners that the government can no longer meet its deficit targets, and he is expected to continue pressing the European Union and Germany for more flexibility on fiscal rules.\n\nStill, in an interview in July, Mr. Sapin rejected the notion that France risked becoming the next sick man of Europe. \u201cWe don\u2019t see it like that,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance is a huge economy in Europe, with an industrial base, innovation and research. I don\u2019t see how we can be sick \u2014 or at least sick for a long time.\u201d", "summary": "And he named Emmanuel Macron, 36, a former investment banker at Rothschild and a deputy secretary general at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace who has been a close adviser to Mr. Hollande on economic policies, as the new economy minister, replacing Mr. Montebourg.It has also highlighted the limited policy tools available to him in an atmosphere, in France and in much of the rest of Europe, of high public debt, persistent unemployment and stagnant growth that threatens to transform the five-year euro crisis into a chronic economic illness.Simon Tilford, an economist who is deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute in London, said that the latest French political crisis would invariably also diminish Mr. Hollande in Brussels in favor of Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel.At home, the abruptness and upheaval caused by the crisis were a fresh blow to Mr. Hollande at a time when his popularity ratings are already at record lows, and disillusioned voters show signs of defecting to other parties, including the far-right National Front.The newspaper La Tribune called Mr. Macron, who formerly worked at the French Treasury, \u201can anti-Montebourg\u201d who was expected to \u201cdefend the official line.\u201d Known for a market-friendly approach, he played a significant role in advising Mr. Hollande during his presidential campaign, promoting an economic policy based on supply and support to companies."}
