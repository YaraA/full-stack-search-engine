Many youths simply call it \u201ca ghetto.\u201d It might also be called the Other France.\n\nHere, and in numerous other poor suburbs that ring French cities, joblessness runs around 20 percent, about double the national average. For young people, it can be as high as 40 percent. About half of residents do not have a high school diploma. Police harassment and profiling are taken for granted as the rule.\n\nIn a time of budget cuts and austerity, conditions have only deteriorated despite years of pledges by successive governments, including President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s, to improve schools and create opportunity.\n\nThe men who carried out the attacks \u2014 Sa\u00efd Kouachi and his brother Ch\u00e9rif, and Amedy Coulibaly, who seized the kosher market \u2014 grew up in the French banlieues and had failed to hold down a series of menial jobs in their youth.\n\nAll were attracted to Islamic extremism by their teenage years, and many residents in the banlieues consider them bad seeds who were propelled toward the fringe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the fallout from their attacks, and the response shown by the rest of France, has been Topic A along the gritty streets of many impoverished suburbs from Paris down through the south of France.\n\nMany worried that as Muslims, they would be lumped together with the killers. Others spoke of fears of retaliation against mosques and other Muslim symbols, as well as the specter of reprisals or even a crackdown by the police after officers were murdered in the terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cPeople feel like there is no solution \u2014 that they are just totally divided from the rest of society,\u201d said Gounedi Traore, 37, a social worker at the Centre Social Intercommunal de la Dhuys, a community center in Clichy-sous-Bois, a suburb outside of Paris that is one of France\u2019s most economically deprived. \u201cAfter what happened with Charlie Hebdo, I feel that this is going to set off a war.\u201d\n\nNearly everyone agreed that the fallout from the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including a heightened security response by France and its allies, was a distraction from a larger problem: a sense of increasing social and economic marginalization that many cited as a root cause of young people drifting toward extremism.\n\n\u201cThe attacks had a global impact but not local impact,\u201d said Faouzi Hamdi, rector of the Okba Ibn Nafee Mosque in Vaulx-en-Velin.\n\nCommunity leaders say France\u2019s drawn-out economic crisis has made already scarce job opportunities even worse.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But we also need to address what it is within our society that is capable of producing monsters.\u201d\n\nThe sense of marginalization did not disappear with the massive solidarity march across Paris on Sunday, which drew more than one million people and 40 presidents and prime ministers to Mr. Hollande\u2019s side. For some banlieue residents, it seemed an almost surreal display that had nothing to do with them.\n\nIn Vaulx-en-Velin, the only Charlie reference to be seen was a sign for the Charlie Chaplin cultural center across the street from City Hall, which is topped with a drawing of a flag of its sister city, the West Bank town of Beit Sahour.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nResidents there ridiculed the \u201cI am Charlie\u201d marches. Some said the terrorist attacks had been staged. While many strongly condemned the attackers for the murders, others insisted the cartoonists had gotten what they deserved.\n\nLocal leaders say this city of 44,000 is a microcosm of France\u2019s failed integration policy, and the underlying social problems that have encouraged young people toward radicalization. Places like Vaulx-en-Velin have remained \u201cpriority zones\u201d for the government since 1964, some noted.\n\nMore on the Paris Shootings\n\nAs in Clichy-sous-Bois, youth here said they felt as if they were living in a separate country, detached from the social and economic benefits of the state and abandoned by a system that preaches unity and solidarity with France\u2019s republican secular values.\n\n\u201cI totally feel cut off from France,\u201d said Karim Yahiaoui, 15, who added that he had not left this suburb more than twice in the past year. Over the past few decades, the Muslim community in Vaulx-en-Velin has become increasingly insular. \u201cMany people only believe their own values now, not those of the republic,\u201d said Anne Dufaud, director of the Mission, a nonprofit organization. She has worked in the community for 20 years. When Mr. Hollande led a moment of silence across France last Thursday for the victims of the attacks, two students and a teacher at a local high school, who declined to be identified, said many students refused to stand.\n\nPatrick Kahn, a manager at the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism in Lyon, who operates a weekly tolerance program in the schools of Vaulx-en-Velin, said simply, \u201cThe integration policy failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suburbs were left behind in government planning, so they became segregated communities,\u201d he explained. Fear of the authorities was already omnipresent, reflected in crude antipolice graffiti on many of the concrete housing complexes, which residents call \u201cles cages de poulet,\u201d or chicken coops.\n\nThe attacks only deepened concerns about racial profiling \u2014 already a common occurrence. One woman wearing an abaya said she had left the house only twice since the Charlie Hebdo attacks because she was afraid of the authorities.\n\nInside schools, students said there were already deep social divisions between Muslims and non-Muslims. One community leader said it was impossible to open a discussion about the Charlie Hebdo attacks without first explaining what satire, caricatures and freedom of expression were. Several teachers said their attempts to discuss the events had led to tense exchanges.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSchools reflect the society,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Gomez, general councilor and deputy mayor of Vaulx-en-Velin. Mr. Gomez is also a high school teacher in the region. \u201cWe have to talk about what has gone wrong and reopen the debates that we\u2019ve been afraid to talk about for so long,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Clichy-sous-Bois, residents said such a debate would have to include a hard look at the economic and social segregation that has defined France\u2019s banlieues decade after decade.\n\n\u201cWe need to give people ways to succeed,\u201d said Mohamed Mokkadem, 37, who runs a trucking company, SKL Transports.\n\nMr. Mokkadem had tried, to no avail, to buy a copy of the latest Charlie Hebdo that hit newsstands on Wednesday. He said he was curious to see close-up the new depiction of the Prophet Muhammad on the cover.\n\nConditions were already bleak in his neighborhood even before the killings, he said, and now, more than ever, he wanted to send a pointed message to the government and the country.\n\n\u201cWhat we are asking for is to be respected according to our worth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe message, quite simply, is to be regarded as truly French.\u201d", "summary": "In numerous interviews, community leaders and Muslims and North Africans who largely populate the banlieues expressed concern that last week\u2019s attacks in Paris would intensify an already explosive social and economic situation in the places where they live.On Tuesday, a French association that represents 120 mayors across France issued a statement warning that the banlieues were \u201con edge\u201d amid the fallout from the attacks, and said there was an urgent need to address economic, social and educational shortfalls.The men who carried out the attacks \u2014 Sa\u00efd Kouachi and his brother Ch\u00e9rif, and Amedy Coulibaly, who seized the kosher market \u2014 grew up in the French banlieues and had failed to hold down a series of menial jobs in their youth.Nearly everyone agreed that the fallout from the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including a heightened security response by France and its allies, was a distraction from a larger problem: a sense of increasing social and economic marginalization that many cited as a root cause of young people drifting toward extremism.As in Clichy-sous-Bois, youth here said they felt as if they were living in a separate country, detached from the social and economic benefits of the state and abandoned by a system that preaches unity and solidarity with France\u2019s republican secular values."}
