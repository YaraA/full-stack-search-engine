But he said that such an approach was still extremely unpopular in Germany.\n\nMs. Merkel left no doubt about whether she was ready to embrace the most radical measures, strongly rejecting Mr. Hollande\u2019s suggestion that European leaders reopen a compact on deficit reduction that they adopted in March.\n\n\u201cWe in Germany are of the opinion, and so am I personally, that the fiscal pact is not negotiable,\u201d Ms. Merkel said at a news conference in Berlin. \u201cIt has been negotiated and has been signed by 25 countries.\u201d\n\nMr. Hollande\u2019s victory is a significant moment in Europe\u2019s continuing efforts to manage the crisis, ejecting Ms. Merkel\u2019s closest collaborator, Mr. Sarkozy, from office. But it remains to be seen whether Mr. Hollande\u2019s election is a real turning point or Ms. Merkel is able to stick to austerity while making only symbolic gestures toward flexibility on the margins.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about some kind of space between structural reforms, like liberalizing labor markets, and the kind of direct stimulus Germans call crude Keynesian measures on the other hand,\u201d said Hans Kundnani, a Germany expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what space there is between those two.\u201d\n\nGerman intransigence also reflects a shift in recent years toward greater self-assurance and a willingness to pursue the country\u2019s own interests more overtly than it had in the postwar era. \u201cGermans have become in a sense much more confident about saying, \u2018This is what we think, and we don\u2019t care if you agree with us,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Kundnani. \u201cEconomists who disagree with them are perceived as being anti-German.\u201d\n\nBut discontent has soared in Europe, evident in the high number of voters supporting radical parties both in the first round of voting in the French presidential election and in Sunday\u2019s vote in Greece, which brought an extreme-right party, the ultranationalist Golden Dawn party, into Parliament in Athens for the first time.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the meantime, the number of prominent politicians demanding new stimulus measures has grown. In Rome, Prime Minister Mario Monti, a technocrat appointed in November as the euro crisis deepened, said the outcome of the French vote was a \u201ccall for a reflection on European policies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cResponsible public finances are a necessary condition, but certainly not sufficient for the key objective: sustainable growth that creates employment and is orientated toward social equality,\u201d Mr. Monti said. \u201cFor this reason it is fundamentally important that Europe urgently adopts concrete policies for growth.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s political opponents at home also said a shift was necessary. Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, said on Monday that the result in France showed that \u201cthe politics of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy led Europe deeper into crisis.\u201d The victory for Mr. Hollande will \u201cnot only change France, but finally help Europe to go in another direction,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Gabriel was careful to add that \u201cno one wants to do away with the fiscal pact,\u201d but merely add measures promoting growth and jobs to it.\n\nKlaus-Peter Flosbach, a member of the finance committee in Parliament and a spokesman on finance matters for Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic delegation, said: \u201cThe fiscal pact is the basis for further cooperation. In the parliamentary groups of the coalition there is absolutely no support for introducing euro bonds.\u201d\n\nThe hard line embraced by Ms. Merkel and her party has been popular with German voters, and as the country\u2019s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, prepares to vote in a new state Parliament next week, it is little wonder that Ms. Merkel refuses to bend. Nor can Mr. Hollande afford to tone down his message with the French parliamentary elections coming up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see coordinated fiscal stimulus happening,\u201d said Mark Hallerberg, director of the Fiscal Governance Center at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Action by the European Central Bank, however, seems more likely.\n\n\u201cEuro bonds are a red line; quantitative easing much less so,\u201d Mr. Hallerberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s fashionable for the Bundesbank to always complain, but it\u2019s only one vote. Merkel can blame the bank. The Germans may be sending mixed signals.\u201d\n\nThe adjustment will be slow and incremental rather than quick and decisive. \u201cThere will be a bit of inflation, and there will be some pay increases,\u201d Mr. Hallerberg said. \u201cHigher wages make Germans wealthier. It\u2019s hard to hate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an interview in the German newsweekly Focus, Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said it was appropriate for wages to rise more quickly in Germany than in other European Union countries. \u201cThese wage increases also have the effect of reducing the imbalances within Europe,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said.\n\nAt the news conference on Monday, Ms. Merkel explained her rationale for holding the line on spending, describing how in her view the debt crisis grew out of the coordinated stimulus packages in the first phase of the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cWe are in the middle of a debate to which France, of course, under its new president, will bring its own emphasis,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are talking about two sides of the same coin: progress is only achievable via solid finances plus growth.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel said she telephoned Mr. Hollande on Sunday night to congratulate him on his victory and expected him to come to Berlin soon. \u201cI may say from my side that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande will be welcomed with open arms here in Germany by me,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cWe will work together well and intensively.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Bofinger said that what was needed was to slow down spending cuts for countries in the midst of recession and \u201ca transfer of fiscal sovereignty to the euro-area level\u201d as a step toward euro bonds.Ms. Merkel left no doubt about whether she was ready to embrace the most radical measures, strongly rejecting Mr. Hollande\u2019s suggestion that European leaders reopen a compact on deficit reduction that they adopted in March.In Rome, Prime Minister Mario Monti, a technocrat appointed in November as the euro crisis deepened, said the outcome of the French vote was a \u201ccall for a reflection on European policies.\u201d\u201cResponsible public finances are a necessary condition, but certainly not sufficient for the key objective: sustainable growth that creates employment and is orientated toward social equality,\u201d Mr. Monti said.In an interview in the German newsweekly Focus, Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said it was appropriate for wages to rise more quickly in Germany than in other European Union countries."}
