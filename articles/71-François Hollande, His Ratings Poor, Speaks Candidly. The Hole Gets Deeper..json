{"title": "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, His Ratings Poor, Speaks Candidly. The Hole Gets Deeper.", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/world/europe/franois-hollande-book-france.html", "body": "Two Le Monde journalists have published a book of frank conversations with Mr. Hollande, recorded weekly and in private over the five years of his term. It is an exercise in name-calling candor that has provoked horror and consternation in the Socialist Party, glee on the opposition right, and fascinated delight in the French news media.\n\nThe reaction in France\u2019s commentariat to his unwanted 662-page unburdening has been bafflement: No French president has ever behaved this way.\n\nThe fuss over the new book, \u201cA President Shouldn\u2019t Say That,\u201d would be more convincing if the president\u2019s political death had not already been declared many times. The amiable Mr. Hollande has long been noted for his resiliency.\n\nYet this scandal may seriously test that tenacity, as Mr. Hollande has now alienated what little remaining support he may have had even in his own Socialist ranks.\n\nIn a national poll published on Thursday, only 11 percent of those queried supported Mr. Hollande for another run at the presidency. The incumbent, nearly all agree, has failed to make a dent in France\u2019s near-permanent 10 percent unemployment rate, and growth is projected to hover at not much over 1 percent.\n\nThe left of his party reproaches him for being too favorable to business, and on the right he is seen as not doing enough for it.\n\nSome have speculated that Mr. Hollande, his political career almost certainly over anyway, has simply decided on a final suicidal plunge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thoroughly dismayed by many of these statements,\u201d the former French ambassador to the United States, Fran\u00e7ois Bujon de l\u2019Estang, said on the influential public affairs radio program L\u2019Esprit Publique Sunday. \u201cThis is a way of doing things that is utterly singular in terms of presidential behavior.\u201d\n\nThis week, Mr Hollande gave a speech honoring the centennial of his mentor and predecessor, the much craftier Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who died 20 years ago.\n\nAs it happened, one of the Socialist Party grandees Mr. Hollande insulted in the new book, Claude Bartolone \u2014 the president of the National Assembly \u2014 walked out. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the stature to be prime minister,\u201d Mr. Hollande told the two journalists, and \u201che\u2019s not big on charisma.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe duty of silence is part of the president\u2019s job description,\u201d Mr. Bartolone huffed to the newspaper La Provence recently.\n\nThe haughty Mr. Mitterrand, like his predecessors, sought to preserve the monarchical style of the French presidency. The French expect this. He would never have let himself go with the two journalists, G\u00e9rard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme, the way Mr. Hollande did.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Hollande\u2019s near-casual approach to his position, the authors believe, is revealed in a laconic phrase he pronounced often in his meetings with them: \u201cIt just so happens that I am president.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I can sense that. She\u2019s extremely determined. Najat, she\u2019s not an intellectual, she didn\u2019t do ENA\u201d \u2014 the elite school attended by Mr. Hollande and much of France\u2019s leadership class \u2014 \u201cbut she wants it.\u201d\n\nMr. Hollande has already had to apologize publicly to France\u2019s judiciary for saying in the book that it was \u201ccowardly.\u201d\n\nThe criticism of the president is now open and unrestrained, even from those in his inner circle. \u201cThe exercise of power means keeping it private,\u201d Mr. Hollande\u2019s own prime minister, Manuel Valls, said this week on France Inter radio.\n\n\u201cIt means respecting what is said in private. And of course it means respecting secrets,\u201d said the prime minister, himself now increasingly seen in the media as the Socialists\u2019 possible substitute for Mr. Hollande.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven before the current round of scandal, Mr. Hollande had never recovered from the very public revelation of his clandestine trysts with the actress Julie Gayet, and his simultaneous fiery breakup with Ms. Trierweiler, who later took her \u201crevenge\u201d \u2014 her word in her own book \u2014 in a tell-all recounting of Mr. Hollande\u2019s frailties and prejudices.\n\nMr. Hollande habitually referred to the poor as \u201cthe toothless ones,\u201d she wrote \u2014 a devastating revelation for a Socialist president.\n\nMr. Hollande is both philosophical and elliptical in recalling this episode with the two journalists.\n\n\u201cShould I not have, earlier on, proceeded to a decision?\u201d Mr. Hollande is quoted as asking, rhetorically, meaning, according to the journalists, \u201cShould he not have broken up with Ms. Trierweiler earlier?\u201d\n\nSuch a decision might have spared him the savaging she inflicted on him. But now, it appears, Mr. Hollande has done it to himself.", "summary": "\u201cI\u2019m thoroughly dismayed by many of these statements,\u201d the former French ambassador to the United States, Fran\u00e7ois Bujon de l\u2019Estang, said on the influential public affairs radio program L\u2019Esprit Publique Sunday.
