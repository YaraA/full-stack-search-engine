The biggest shift would involve getting more soldiers to move away from their \u201cstatic,\u201d or fixed, positions, allowing them to patrol the surrounding area on foot.\n\n\u201cOnce we ask our soldiers to assume the security of our national territory, we would do better to exploit in full measure their capacities and their training,\u201d Mr. Audibert Troin said in an interview. The aim is to eventually leave only 20 percent of the soldiers in static positions, inversing the original ratio of the Sentinelle deployments.\n\n\u201cA soldier is not trained to stand like a pillar,\u201d Mr. Audibert Troin said. \u201cFor that, we should hire private security guards. When the soldiers are dynamic, they can be more effective, and less likely to be targets.\u201d\n\nThere have been numerous episodes in which soldiers on Sentinelle duty have come under attack \u2014 notably in Nice in March 2015 when several were wounded in front of a Jewish community center by a knife-wielding assailant, and in Valence in January, when a man driving a red Peugeot plowed into two guarding a mosque.\n\nA soldier opened fire during the attack in Valence, wounding the attacker and a passer-by, the only shots fired during the course of the Sentinelle operation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPutting soldiers on the streets in visible positions may have helped calm public fears, but as the parliamentary report concluded, maintaining the deployments at current levels is a drain on the French armed services, in terms of personnel and morale.\n\nWhat was initially intended as an emergency measure is now becoming the new normal, justified with each new attack.\n\nAfter the attack in Nice, bringing down the number of soldiers is not an option. The new imperative, Mr. Audibert Troin said, is to make their presence more effective, through better coordination with police forces and more incentives for military recruits.\n\nRabbi Malka said his congregation remained grateful for the protection. \u201cIt is not their presence which is troubling but the danger, which is now more evident than before,\u201d he said.", "summary": "The biggest shift would involve getting more soldiers to move away from their \u201cstatic,\u201d or fixed, positions, allowing them to patrol the surrounding area on foot.\u201cOnce we ask our soldiers to assume the security of our national territory, we would do better to exploit in full measure their capacities and their training,\u201d Mr. Audibert Troin said in an interview.There have been numerous episodes in which soldiers on Sentinelle duty have come under attack \u2014 notably in Nice in March 2015 when several were wounded in front of a Jewish community center by a knife-wielding assailant, and in Valence in January, when a man driving a red Peugeot plowed into two guarding a mosque.Putting soldiers on the streets in visible positions may have helped calm public fears, but as the parliamentary report concluded, maintaining the deployments at current levels is a drain on the French armed services, in terms of personnel and morale.The new imperative, Mr. Audibert Troin said, is to make their presence more effective, through better coordination with police forces and more incentives for military recruits."}
