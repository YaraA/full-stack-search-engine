Eric Van der Sijpt, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor\u2019s office, said that the warrant would be sent to an investigative judge \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\nThe judge would then decide whether to order the arrest of Mr. Puigdemont and the four other politicians. If they are arrested, the next step would be an appearance before a Belgian court that would decide whether to return them to Spain to stand trial, Mr. Van der Sijpt said.\n\n\u201cThe whole procedure, including appeal up to the highest court, can take between one and two months,\u201d he said.\n\nDirk Vanheule, a professor of international law at the University of Antwerp, said that the Catalan elected officials could argue that the international arrest warrant is not valid in Belgium on several grounds, among them a claim that the charge of rebellion has an insufficiently clear equivalent in Belgian criminal law.\n\nThey could also contend that the fundamental right of suspects to a fair trial is not guaranteed in Spain, an argument Mr. Puigdemont has made repeatedly this week.\n\nOn Thursday, Paul Bekaert, Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s Belgian lawyer, told VRT News, a television channel, that \u201cif the extradition is approved, then we will definitely go the whole way,\u201d in terms of appeals within Belgium\u2019s judicial system.\n\nMr. Puigdemont\u2019s arrival in Belgium on Monday raised problems for Prime Minister Charles Michel, who leads a governing coalition that includes both Francophone liberals and Flemish separatists. Mr. Michel will have to contend with conflicting needs, keeping in check separatists in his government who are sympathetic to the Catalans\u2019 desire for independence while maintaining good diplomatic relations with Spain.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His conservative separatist party is part of the prime minister\u2019s coalition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bourgeois accused Spain of \u201cengaging in repression,\u201d adding, \u201cI am stunned that such a thing is still possible in today\u2019s Europe.\u201d\n\nHe also took a jab at the European Union for declining to intervene in the Catalan conflict. \u201cA European Union that silently defends the interests of nation states, and does not dare to raise its voice to protect freedom of expression \u2014 that worries me,\u201d he said.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, the leader of Scotland, tweeted that \u201cregardless of opinion on Catalonia, the jailing of elected leaders is wrong and should be condemned by all democrats.\u201d\n\nThe European Union, however, views the Catalan conflict as a matter of Spanish national sovereignty. Annika Breidthardt, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said on Friday that the European Union would not intervene and that \u201cthis is a matter entirely for the judicial authorities whose independence we respect fully.\u201d\n\nThe arrest warrant, along with the detention on Thursday of half of the members of the former Catalan government, may provoke new street protests in Catalonia. It could also reinvigorate the independence movement before regional elections scheduled for December.\n\nSpain\u2019s judiciary also turned down an appeal on Friday to release two other separatist leaders who have been jailed since mid-October awaiting trial on sedition charges."}
