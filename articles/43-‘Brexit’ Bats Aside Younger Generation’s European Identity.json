Splitting Britain from the European Union may put a damper on future changes important to this globalized generation, like the move toward a single European digital market for movie and music streaming, and the end, by next year, of cellphone roaming charges when crossing European Union borders.\n\nDays before the British referendum, Mr. Gu\u00e9ry, Ms. Muscroft and Ms. Desbles jokingly wondered, while waiting in the passport lines at the airport in Barcelona, Spain, whether Britons like Ms. Muscroft would soon be kicked out of the European Union lane.\n\nNow, the friends are wondering whether their children will be able to benefit from Erasmus as they did. If their European health insurance cards will still cover them in Britain. Whether France might soon follow with a Frexit vote, the Netherlands with a Nexit, and who knows what else?\n\n\u201cMy initial reaction when it happened was feeling like part of my identity had been stripped away,\u201d said Ms. Muscroft, 24, who works in London for an online food-ordering site. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve always really felt a strong connection to, with Europe, is a unified sense of fate \u2014 the fact that we are all in this together, and that we benefit each other through this union.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most profound force in creating this European identity was Erasmus, now called Erasmus+, which was created in 1987 and had supported 3.3 million students studying or training abroad by the end of 2013-14 academic year, according to a European Union report. (Yet, in the last five years, fewer than 5 percent of all university graduates in the participating countries were Erasmus students.)\n\nMagali Ballatore, a sociologist at the University of Aix-Marseille in France who wrote a book on the Erasmus program, said it would be hard to tease out whether Erasmus alumni were internationally minded because of the experience, or whether that prospect had attracted them to the program in the first place.\n\nVideo\n\nBut younger Europeans are more likely to report an attachment to the European Union than those 55 and over, according to the most recent Eurobarometer survey. In Britain before the balloting, surveys showed that 57 percent of voters ages 18 to 34 wanted it to remain in the bloc. (An identical percentage over age 55 supported the Leave campaign.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the vote\u2019s aftermath, many young voices have expressed fear and despair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been so angry,\u201d Mr. Gu\u00e9ry said. \u201cI was texting friends, people who did Erasmus, people who lived in Britain or Germany. We are disgusted that this might be the trigger for the destruction of the only good thing that these governments have done in 50 years: peace.\u201d\n\nIt is still unclear what kind of relationship Britain will negotiate with the European Union, but trade is unlikely to screech to a halt and short-term travelers are not likely to face stringent visa requirements. As for the union\u2019s Erasmus program \u2014 in which Britain ranked fifth two years ago for students sent abroad and fourth for foreign students taken in \u2014 nonmembers like Iceland, Norway and Turkey are already allowed to participate. Until Britain officially leaves the union, the program will continue there, too.\n\nBritain had always stood apart in any case, having never adopted the euro or joined Europe\u2019s passport-free Schengen zone.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Leersch, the German whom Mr. Gu\u00e9ry met at Stockholm University, counted among the benefits of European Union membership the 500 euros per month (about $550) that Erasmus provided to cover living expenses in Sweden; her two-month internship at the European Parliament in 2011; and the European Capitals of Culture program, which has given a boost to artists and tourism in more than 40 cities.\n\nFor Mr. Gu\u00e9ry, the list of advantages included environmental regulations and his European health insurance card, which gave him access to health care when he had mononucleosis in Berlin.\n\nMs. Seele, who is studying for the bar exam in Berlin, said that for those and other reasons, she \u201creally feels like a European.\u201d Many of her friends, as well as her brothers and sisters, have studied or worked abroad in Europe.\n\n\u201cThe fact that you don\u2019t have to exchange money anymore, that you don\u2019t have to go through border control and show your passport, it is part of the feeling that you are not leaving from one country to the other,\u201d she said. \u201cThat you are still more or less in one community.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Texting and social media like Facebook and Skype help people stay in touch, no matter how far away; when they want to meet, discount airlines like easyJet and Ryanair make the borders further disappear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Gu\u00e9ry and his friends meet every three to six months \u2014 sometimes back in Berlin, but also in Brussels, Budapest and other cities. That also means more exposure to very different people and places.\n\n\u201cI never had an opinion on Norway, for example, before I moved abroad,\u201d Ms. Muscroft said. \u201cAnd suddenly one of my closest friends is Norwegian.\u201d\n\nEven this staunchly pro-European group knows the union is far from perfect. (\u201cStop voting on stupid things like olive oil labeling, and answer the need for security and immigration policy,\u201d Mr. Gu\u00e9ry said.) The friends hope that Britain\u2019s departure will push the institution to reform itself, but there are also concerns that it will fuel political extremes at home.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m most worried about is how Marine Le Pen and other leaders at the National Front are using these kinds of debates for their own political purposes,\u201d said Ms. Desbles, a 25-year-old teacher, referring to the far-right party and its leader, who favor a similar breakaway for France.\n\nMr. Gu\u00e9ry has been thinking about his grandparents and great-grandparents, who bore the brunt of both world wars. \u201cSo much of my family suffered from the stupidity of nationalism,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my continent going back 50 years.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Gu\u00e9ry was 13, he refused to take German classes at school \u2014 \u201ca Nazi language,\u201d he thought at the time. His mother persuaded him to do otherwise, but the three E\u2019s helped, too.\n\n\u201cI lived in the heart of what destroyed my country,\u201d he said of Germany. \u201cBut I learned the story of the people; now I speak the language. I didn\u2019t do that by myself. It\u2019s because of Europe.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cMy initial reaction when it happened was feeling like part of my identity had been stripped away,\u201d said Ms. Muscroft, 24, who works in London for an online food-ordering site.
