Antonio Spadaro, the editor of the leading Jesuit journal in Rome. The pope, formerly a cardinal, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, spoke of the mistakes he feels he made when he became the superior of his Jesuit province in Argentina at the \u201ccrazy\u201d young age of 36. He talked about his vision of the church, and why he has chosen not to spend much time talking about abortion, gay marriage and contraception. He explained what he meant by the headline-grabbing remark he made about gay people: \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d And he said that doubt is essential to finding God.\n\n\u2014 LAURIE GOODSTEIN\n\nWho is Jorge Mario Bergoglio?\n\nI am a sinner. This is the most accurate definition. It is not a figure of speech, a literary genre. I am a sinner.\n\nWhy did you become a Jesuit, a member of the Society of Jesus?\n\nThree things in particular struck me about the Society: the missionary spirit, community and discipline. And this is strange, because I am a really, really undisciplined person. But their discipline, the way they manage their time \u2014 these things struck me so much.\n\nWhat did you learn in your early experience as superior of the Jesuit province in Argentina?\n\nMy authoritarian and quick manner of making decisions led me to have serious problems and to be accused of being ultraconservative. I lived a time of great interior crisis when I was in Cordova. To be sure, I have never been like Blessed Imelda, but I have never been a right-winger. It was my authoritarian way of making decisions that created problems.\n\nWhat should the church say to divorced and remarried people, and homosexuals?\n\nIn Buenos Aires I used to receive letters from homosexual persons who are \u201csocially wounded\u201d because they tell me that they feel like the church has always condemned them. But the church does not want to do this. During the return flight from Rio de Janeiro, I said that if a homosexual person is of good will and is in search of God, I am no one to judge. By saying this, I said what the catechism says. Religion has the right to express its opinion in the service of the people, but God in creation has set us free: it is not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person.\n\nA person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality. I replied with another question: \u201cTell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?\u201d We must always consider the person.\n\nWhat kind of church do you dream of?\n\nWe cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods. This is not possible. I have not spoken much about these things, and I was reprimanded for that. But when we speak about these issues, we have to talk about them in a context. The teaching of the church, for that matter, is clear and I am a son of the church, but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time.\n\nThe dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent. The church\u2019s pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently \u2026\n\nWe have to find a new balance; otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel. The proposal of the Gospel must be more simple, profound, radiant. It is from this proposition that the moral consequences then flow.\n\nI say this also thinking about the preaching and content of our preaching.\n\nWhat should be the role of the Vatican\u2019s various departments (or congregations)?\n\nThey are instruments of help. In some cases, however, when they are not functioning well, they run the risk of becoming institutions of censorship. It is amazing to see the denunciations for lack of orthodoxy that come to Rome. I think the cases should be investigated by the local bishops\u2019 conferences, which can get valuable assistance from Rome. These cases, in fact, are much better dealt with locally. The Roman congregations are mediators; they are not middlemen or managers.\n\nWhat should be the role of women in the church?\n\nI am wary of a solution that can be reduced to a kind of \u201cfemale machismo,\u201d because a woman has a different makeup than a man. But what I hear about the role of women is often inspired by an ideology of machismo. Women are asking deep questions that must be addressed. The church cannot be herself without the woman and her role. The woman is essential for the church. Mary, a woman, is more important than the bishops. I say this because we must not confuse the function with the dignity. We must therefore investigate further the role of women in the church. We have to work harder to develop a profound theology of the woman. Only by making this step will it be possible to better reflect on their function within the church. The feminine genius is needed wherever we make important decisions. The challenge today is this: to think about the specific place of women also in those places where the authority of the church is exercised for various areas of the church.\n\nIf encountering God is a journey, then we can make mistakes?\n\nIf one has the answers to all the questions \u2014 that is the proof that God is not with him. It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself. The great leaders of the people of God, like Moses, have always left room for doubt. You must leave room for the Lord, not for our certainties; we must be humble.\n\n\u2026 Our life is not given to us like an opera libretto, in which all is written down; but it means going, walking, doing, searching, seeing. \u2026 We must enter into the adventure of the quest for meeting God; we must let God search and encounter us.\n\n\u2026 If the Christian is a restorationist, a legalist, if he wants everything clear and safe, then he will find nothing. Tradition and memory of the past must help us to have the courage to open up new areas to God. Those who today always look for disciplinarian solutions, those who long for an exaggerated doctrinal \u201csecurity,\u201d those who stubbornly try to recover a past that no longer exists \u2014 they have a static and inward-directed view of things. In this way, faith becomes an ideology among other ideologies. I have a dogmatic certainty: God is in every person\u2019s life. God is in everyone\u2019s life. Even if the life of a person has been a disaster, even if it is destroyed by vices, drugs or anything else \u2014 God is in this person\u2019s life. You can, you must try to seek God in every human life. Although the life of a person is a land full of thorns and weeds, there is always a space in which the good seed can grow. You have to trust God."}
