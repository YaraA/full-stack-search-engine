It hailed the plan as proof that Europe could respond with unity and solidarity to a problem that has put huge strains on countries like Italy, Greece and Malta, which have taken most of the migrants fleeing conflict from North Africa.\n\nBut the plan, which is backed by Germany, immediately ran into fierce opposition from a number of countries, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe, whose own citizens have flooded into wealthier nations in Western Europe to find work but where public opinion is strongly against taking in Arab and African migrants.\n\nMore than 50,000 migrants have arrived in Italy alone this year, according to Frontex, the European Union agency that helps protect the bloc\u2019s borders. Most of them are stuck in legal limbo, awaiting word on whether they will be granted asylum or given other lawful status so they can settle and work.\n\nDenmark has the right to opt out of European Union policy on immigration, as does Britain, but populist Danish politicians, nonetheless, seized on Brussels\u2019 quota proposal before last week\u2019s elections as an example of unacceptable meddling by the European Union in the sovereign affairs of member countries.\n\nUnlike the Danish People\u2019s Party, which has tried to curb more extremist voices, Slovakian anti-immigration groups that gathered here openly paraded their racism.\n\nSpeaking at the rally, Marian Kotleba, governor of a central Slovak region, wished protesters a \u201chappy white day\u201d and described the protest as an attempt to \u201csave Slovakia\u201d from the European quota program. \u201cEven one immigrant is one too many,\u201d said Mr. Kotleba, a founder of the People\u2019s Party \u2014 Our Slovakia.\n\nA Saudi family with a small child was attacked near the main rail station, and protesters destroyed at least six police cars, according to news reports.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOrganizers said about 6,000 people took part in the protest, which disrupted a cycle race around Bratislava\u2019s medieval castle. But local news reports estimated the crowd at 3,000 to 5,000 \u2014 still a large number by the standards of Slovakia, where street protests usually attract far fewer people. When a speaker asked protesters whether they would mind if he burned the European Union\u2019s blue 12-star flag, the crowd shouted \u201cNo.\u201d A flag was later set on fire.\n\nWhile the protest was dominated by extremist groups, including a neo-Nazi one, mainstream politicians have also condemned the quota proposals.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He denounced the European Commission for what he called a \u201crisky strategy\u201d of trying to force countries to share in accepting migrants.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, who has clashed repeatedly with Brussels over issues like the death penalty and what critics say are his authoritarian ways, said every country had a duty to defend its own borders from unwanted outsiders, suggesting that Italy and Greece had failed to do so and should not now expect help from others.\n\n\u201cTo defend borders is a national responsibility,\u201d Mr. Orban said. \u201cAs a state, you have to protect your own borders. I don\u2019t believe in a European solution.\u201d\n\nHungary recently announced plans to build a 13-foot-high fence along its border with Serbia, which is not a member of the European Union but has become a transit point for migrants seeking to enter the bloc. Serbia has protested the fence plan and vowed to block it.\n\nWorried that the proposed mandatory quota system for migrants is fast becoming an emblem of Europe\u2019s divisions rather than action, European Union officials proposed last week that resettlement of migrants be done on a \u201cvoluntary mandatory\u201d basis. It was unclear what this would mean in practice.\n\nThe confusion and passions stirred by the migrant issue have put a spotlight on how the domestic politics of individual European countries undermine Europe\u2019s ability to take joint and decisive action. The same dynamic has also thwarted efforts to resolve the Greek debt crisis, with public opinion in Germany, Slovakia, Finland and many other nations strongly opposed to easing demands on Greece.\n\nOn Monday, European Union leaders are due to hold an emergency meeting to try to break the long-running deadlock over how to deal with Greece, which faces possible bankruptcy and default at the end of the month. The meeting will be followed on Thursday by another gathering to discuss the migrant crisis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe migrant quota plan, which would force Slovakia to take about 700 migrants who landed in Italy and Greece, never had much chance of winning widespread approval, prompting criticism that the program from the start was largely a public relations exercise by the European Commission to create an illusion of action.\n\nIn a post on his Facebook page, Slovakia\u2019s president, Andrej Kiska, voiced sympathy for countries facing the greatest influx.\n\n\u201cI repeat that there are no easy solutions to this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t leave everything on the states that are hit the hardest. If we don\u2019t start to cooperate, the European problem can become a global one. If we are not able to explain why we need to help people in need, we leave the space for the extremists. And we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d"}
