Religion, he argued, was \u201cjust a veneer\u201d for anger at the dysfunctional Arab states left behind by colonial powers and the \u201cOrientalist\u201d condescension many Arabs still feel from the West.\n\n\u201cThe Arab states have not delivered what they are supposed to deliver and it can only lead to a deep sense of resentment and frustration, or to revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the nonviolence that needs to be explained, not the violence.\u201d\n\nPhotographs\n\nOnly a very small number of Muslims pin the blame directly on the religion itself.\n\n\u201cWhat has ISIS done that Muhammad did not do?\u201d an outspoken atheist, Ahmed Harqan, recently asked on a popular television talk show here, using common shorthand for the Islamic State to argue that the problem of violence is inherent to Islam.\n\nConsidered almost blasphemous by most Egyptian Muslims, his challenge provoked weeks of outcry from Islamic religious broadcasters and prompted much-watched follow-up shows. In subsequent debates on the same program, Salem Abdel-Gelil, a scholar from the state-sponsored Al Azhar institute and former official of the ministry overseeing mosques, fired back with Islamic verses about tolerance, peace and freedom.\n\nBut then he warned that, under Egypt\u2019s religion-infused legal system, the public espousal of atheism might land his opponents in jail.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen a person comes out and promotes his heresy, promotes his debauchery, and justifies his apostasy on the basis that \u2018Islam is not good,\u2019 then there is the judiciary,\u201d Sheikh Abdel-Gelil said. \u201cThe judiciary will get him.\u201d\n\nM. Steven Fish, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, sought to quantify the correlation between Islam and violence. In his book, \u201cAre Muslims Distinctive?,\u201d he found that murder rates were substantially lower in Muslim-majority countries and instances of political violence were no more frequent.\n\nOver a 15-year period ending in 2008, Islamist militants were responsible for 60 percent of high-casualty terrorist bombings, his study found, but almost all were concentrated in just a handful of Muslim-majority countries in the context of larger conflicts that were occurring \u2014 places like Afghanistan after the American invasion or Algeria after the military takeover.\n\n\u201cIs Islam violent? I would say absolutely not,\u201d Mr. Fish said in an interview. \u201cThere is very little empirical evidence that Islam is violent.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Even before his speech, he has also presided over an effort to reassert the state\u2019s control over the teaching and application of Islam by installing government-aligned imams in mosques and dictating Friday sermons.\n\nIntellectuals supporting him have applauded his efforts and called for the state to lead a sweeping top-down overhaul of the popular understanding of Islam, attributing the problem to a lack of education or cultural advancement. \u201cReligious thought, or religious discourse, is afflicted with backwardness,\u201d Gaber Asfour, the minister of culture, declared in a recent television interview. \u201cWe now live in an age of backwardness.\u201d\n\nMore on the Paris Shootings\n\nMany pro-government intellectuals consider the popularity of the Muslim Brotherhood an aspect of that backwardness and argue that all such Islamist political movements are inherently violent \u2014 even if the groups publicly disavow violence.\n\n\u201cTheir task is not becoming modern; it is becoming hegemonic again, making a new world in which Islam will be on top again,\u201d argued Prof. Sherif Younis, a historian at the Helwan University here who has led calls for an Islamic \u201creformation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvery fundamentalist has in mind a counter-regime, even if he does not know how to use a knife,\u201d Professor Younis said. That includes the mainstream Islamists of the Brotherhood and the ultraconservatives known as Salafis, as well as the overtly violent jihadist groups like the Islamic State or Al Qaeda, he said.\n\nOthers argue that the state control of the Muslim religious establishments \u2014 whether in relatively secular states like Egypt or the United Arab Emirates, or in explicitly religious ones like Saudi Arabia \u2014 only reinforces the problems. Such attempts at control inject politics into religious teaching, diminishing its credibility. And the state religious establishments further entangle politics and religion by seeking to confer the legitimacy of Islamic law on autocratic rulers.\n\nAmr Ezzat, a researcher with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, argued that the official clerics and the jihadists agree on one thing: Both \u201csay that Islam is the source of the state\u2019s authority, and that we should all be governed by Islamic law.\u201d\n\nSome say it is also na\u00efve to expect unaccountable governments like Egypt\u2019s that cannot provide health care or education to do a better job leading religious reform.\n\n\u201cIn an authoritarian society, there is no room for reasoned debate, so it is not surprising that irrational religious discourse is going to flourish in certain quarters of Egypt or the Arab world,\u201d argued Mohammad Fadel, an Egyptian-American Islamic legal scholar at the University of Toronto. \u201cBut the answer of these governments has been to double down on repression and that is only likely to increase the extremism.\u201d\n\nA handful of non-Muslim researchers in the West \u2014 typically outside the academic mainstream \u2014 seek to build a case that Islam is inherently more violent than Judaism or Christianity by highlighting certain Quranic verses. But they struggle to explain away approving passages about violence in other religious texts, such as the book of Joshua in the Old Testament, the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, or the statement attributed to Jesus by the Gospel writer Matthew that \u201cI come not to bring peace, but a sword.\u201d\n\nRaymond Ibrahim, the author of \u201cCrucified Again: Exposing Islam\u2019s New War on Christians,\u201d argued in an interview that the passages in the Bible are descriptive but the Quranic ones are prescriptive. But most scholars say such distinctions are matters of interpretation.\n\nMainstream Muslim scholars in the Arab world or the West emphasize the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s injunctions to mercy and forgiveness, his forbidding of \u201ccoercion in matters of religion,\u201d or his exhortation to restraint even in self-defense. \u201cFight in the cause of God against those who fight you, but do not transgress limits,\u201d reads one verse. \u201cGod does not love transgressors.\u201d\n\nEmad Shahin, the editor of The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics, compared the discussion of violence in the Islamic tradition to the \u201cjust war\u201d teachings of the Catholic Church. But because of the specific history of Western colonialism and Arab responses, he argued, Islam now provides an effective way to appeal to feelings of identity, community, justice, freedom and nationalism all at once. \u201cIt is all rolled into one,\u201d he said.", "summary": "\u201cSome people who feel crushed or ignored will go toward extremism, and they use religion because that is what they have at hand,\u201d said Said Ferjani, an official of Tunisia\u2019s mainstream Islamist party, Ennahda, speaking about the broader phenomenon of violence in the name of Islam.In subsequent debates on the same program, Salem Abdel-Gelil, a scholar from the state-sponsored Al Azhar institute and former official of the ministry overseeing mosques, fired back with Islamic verses about tolerance, peace and freedom.Over a 15-year period ending in 2008, Islamist militants were responsible for 60 percent of high-casualty terrorist bombings, his study found, but almost all were concentrated in just a handful of Muslim-majority countries in the context of larger conflicts that were occurring \u2014 places like Afghanistan after the American invasion or Algeria after the military takeover.\u201cIn an authoritarian society, there is no room for reasoned debate, so it is not surprising that irrational religious discourse is going to flourish in certain quarters of Egypt or the Arab world,\u201d argued Mohammad Fadel, an Egyptian-American Islamic legal scholar at the University of Toronto.Mainstream Muslim scholars in the Arab world or the West emphasize the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s injunctions to mercy and forgiveness, his forbidding of \u201ccoercion in matters of religion,\u201d or his exhortation to restraint even in self-defense."}
