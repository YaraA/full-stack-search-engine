He looked at various options, including empty office space and tent camps.\n\nBut, exceptionally for almost any country, the Netherlands had a surplus of unoccupied jail cells because of plunging crime rates, and had even been renting out cells to other countries, like Belgium and Norway.\n\nWhen the asylum seekers arrived, part of a tide of more than a million migrants who entered Europe last year, the empty detention centers seemed like a practical option, Mr. Dijkhoff said.\n\n\u201cAt the time we did it, the influx was so high that if at the end of the day we had enough beds for the people who were coming in, we were proud,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile the prisons are \u201cnot five-star facilities,\u201d Mr. Dijkhoff added, they do have some \u201cclear benefits,\u201d including kitchens and private rooms.\n\nAt many, \u201cyou even have a gym, or you have an outside court to play football or other sports, which you don\u2019t have in a repurposed office building, for example,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd most times, you have more space.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn a recent day, Mr. Nabhan, formerly an engineer at a security company, and his wife, Chena Kabane, 26, sat on their bunk beds, punching their thumbs into their smartphones while the heavy steel door that offers them a measure of privacy was left open so they could use the wireless internet.\n\nFor the last five months, when Ms. Kabane has needed to bathe, Mr. Nabhan has stood guard so men do not walk in on her. The couple cannot cook their own food, but receive microwaved portions. They have not been able to sleep in the same bed. Instead, he puts his mattress on the floor next to her bottom bunk.\n\nStill, they have tried to remain appreciative and optimistic.\n\n\u201cAt the start, it felt like a prison, even though we are free to come and go,\u201d Mr. Nabhan said. \u201cBut when we look at people who are staying in tents, we know we have good luck.\u201d\n\nOthers are less sanguine.\n\nPooria Bazhian, 26, and his mother, Nahid Mikaeilidiba, 52 \u2014 former Muslims who converted to Christianity in Iran, where apostasy is punishable by death \u2014 have also been housed there for five months.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There isn\u2019t any fresh air. There isn\u2019t green space for walking.\u201d\n\nAs the time lengthens, complaints have grown, along with concerns that a quick and imperfect fix has become the norm.\n\n\u201cWhen we were consulted on this, we said, O.K., given that this is an emergency, we can accept it,\u201d said Mr. Kuipers of the advocacy group.\n\n\u201cBut now it\u2019s been there for a half a year, and I don\u2019t see them going away,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned that former prisons are not temporary, but the new standard.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe government\u2019s Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers \u2014 known by its Dutch initials, C.O.A. \u2014 ran 40 reception centers, with room for about 30,000 people, in January 2015, before the crisis began. It now runs 121 facilities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout 16,000 people currently housed in the agency\u2019s facilities have received their residency permits, but they cannot move out until they find permanent places to live, and there is a backlog, Mr. Dijkhoff said.\n\nThe wait time before asylum seekers can expect a decision on their applications, which used to be six months at most, now typically begins after seven months and can take as long as 15.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any large complaints on the grounds that they don\u2019t want to stay in a prison,\u201d said a C.O.A. spokesman, Jan Willem Anholts. \u201cWe hardly get complaints about the facilities; we get complaints about the length of the procedure.\u201d\n\nSome of the sites have been adapted in such a way that they might not be recognizable as former prisons, Mr. Anholts said. But at the 400-cell De Koepel, one of three pentagonal prisons built in the early 1900s, there is little disguising that it is a correctional facility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a prison,\u201d Mr. Anholts said. \u201cYou can\u2019t change to make it look otherwise.\u201d\n\nMr. Kuipers said he was particularly concerned about the psychological impact on people fleeing persecution and imprisonment in their home countries. The biggest groups of migrants who arrived in the Netherlands in 2015 were Syrians and Eritreans, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Eritreans fled a regime in their country where imprisonment was a huge problem,\u201d Mr. Kuipers said. \u201cMany of the Eritreans have been imprisoned; I would guess about half of them.\u201d\n\nHe added, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, \u201cFor people who have been in prisons and have been victims of torture \u2014 by the Assad regime, for example \u2014 it can trigger certain memories.\u201d\n\nStill, many of the asylum seekers are trying to make the best of it.\n\nOn a recent day, Dawlat Derbas, 34, sat outside making a collage in the women\u2019s garden, a former prison yard where some have planted boxes with flowers.\n\nThe granddaughter of a Palestinian refugee, Ms. Derbas has always been officially stateless, even though she was born in Syria. In Aleppo, a city in the north, she had a house, a car and a job as a teacher, and she was working toward a master\u2019s degree in sociology, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn Syria, I had everything,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t have freedom, and that\u2019s very important. Here, I am not free, not yet.\u201d", "summary": "When the asylum seekers arrived, part of a tide of more than a million migrants who entered Europe last year, the empty detention centers seemed like a practical option, Mr. Dijkhoff said.
