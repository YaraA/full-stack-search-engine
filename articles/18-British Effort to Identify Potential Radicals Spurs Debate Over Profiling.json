In the case of the boy in Blackburn, whose name has not been publicly disclosed because of his age, the police later arrested him after they found that he had made a detailed plan for an Islamic State-inspired massacre in Australia.\n\nLast October, he was sentenced for inciting terrorism overseas and became, at 15, the youngest person to get a life sentence in Britain in a terrorism case.\n\nThe Prevent program, started by Prime Minister Tony Blair in the aftermath of the July 7, 2005, London bombings, encourages and in some cases requires Britons to watch for signs of radicalization in their communities and to alert the authorities about people who could become risks, before they turn violent. Once someone is identified, the authorities judge whether the threat of radicalization is sufficient to justify further counseling; if so, the at-risk person is offered a place in a voluntary portion of the Prevent program known as Channel, which seeks to steer participants away from extremism.\n\nLast year, Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s government expanded the program\u2019s scope, making it a legal duty for schools, hospitals, local governments, social services and prisons to flag extremist behavior with the authorities. Opponents say that requirement risks turning Britain into a surveillance state where one section of the public is encouraged to snoop on everybody else.\n\nPrevent\u2019s 65 million pound ($94 million) annual budget covers the cost of supporting community organizations that help at-risk groups, such as disaffected youth or British Muslim women isolated from mainstream society. Last month, Mr. Cameron announced a \u00a320 million fund to teach English to Muslim women. Communities that are cut off, he said, are potential breeding grounds for terrorists.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Prevent program provides instruction to teachers, doctors, social workers, and prison and housing officials on how to detect early signs of radicalization. The program\u2019s officers explain, for example, the influence of Anwar al-Awlaki, a cleric born in the United States who was killed in an American drone strike in Yemen in 2011 but who continues to inspire young Islamic militants through videos of his lectures available online.\n\nTeachers are supplied with dictionaries to help them identify Arabic words used by the Islamic State such as \u201cDawla/Dawlah,\u201d a term used to describe the group by its supporters; the pejorative \u201ckaffir/kuffar\u201d to mean non-Muslims; and less obvious words like \u201crafidha,\u201d a derogatory term for Shiite Muslims.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Home Office said more than 400,000 public sector employees had attended lectures about the program. They are given a list of 22 \u201ccontributing factors\u201d that signal a person\u2019s potential engagement with an extremist group, including a loss of interest in friends and activities, unwillingness to listen to other points of view, using derogatory names for another group and condoning violence.\n\nThose indicators, described in a Prevent guidance booklet, also include people with \u201coccupational skills that can enable acts of terrorism\u201d such as civil engineering, pharmacology, or technical expertise, including knowledge of information technology, chemicals, or military training.\n\nAs part of the effort, schools have installed monitoring devices on school computers, enabling teachers and administrators to see what kind of material their students are viewing online.\n\nHowever imperfect, Prevent is about \u201cmaking teachers aware that some of their kids might go in the direction\u201d of terrorism, said Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. He raised the example of four girls from the Bethnal Green Academy in London who traveled to Syria in 2014 and last year.\n\n\u201cClearly a mini social movement was going on within that school,\u201d he said. \u201cThose teachers now know what to look for and how to tell authorities.\u201d\n\nPatsy Kane is the executive director of two all-girls high schools in Manchester. Most of the 2,500 pupils are Muslim, she said, and the schools have already dealt with sensitive issues, such as students being forced into marriage. Prevent, she said, \u201cis an added duty, a moral duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take away the risk, and we can\u2019t control who is influencing our students outside of school,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we can do is to find alternative narratives, like those given by Islamic State defectors, and try to chip away at the group\u2019s missionary zeal.\u201d\n\nAnyone flagged by the program is screened several times by the police and local officials. If a formal referral is made, the person is encouraged to take part in Channel, the de-radicalization program. This often involves an imam who plays the role of counselor, psychotherapist and religious scholar.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIntervention is voluntary because referred individuals are in what the government calls a \u201cpre-criminal\u201d stage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Although he was within his rights to decline, he was nonetheless put into a special school for youngsters showing unruly behavior.\n\nIn court later, the schoolboy said that his exclusion from regular school further radicalized him. That culminated in threats he made against a teacher in early 2015 that he wanted to \u201cstab him in the neck with his pencil and kill him like halal.\u201d He told another: \u201cYou are on my beheading list.\u201d\n\nWhen the police arrested him over the threats, they uncovered the terrorist plot in Australia. His phone contained images of the Islamic State, a Twitter account with 24,000 followers, Internet searches for bomb recipes, and encrypted instructions to a militant to behead a victim and run over police officers. Pretending to be a much older man, the teenager advised the militant on using a knife with a handle \u201cperfect for tearing through throat.\u201d\n\nIn the first six months of 2015, a total of 3,228 referrals were made, according to the latest figures from the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council.\n\nTwo-thirds of the referrals came from schools, social services and health care practitioners. Less than 10 percent came from local communities, suggesting that Muslims, among others, view Prevent with suspicion. As a result of the referrals, 46 people were prevented from traveling to Syria and 225 \u201care being successfully dissuaded from undertaking extremist activity related to Syria,\u201d the police chiefs\u2019 council said. A majority of referrals were of Muslims.\n\nBut success on the individual level can come at a cost.\n\nShashank Joshi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said he was concerned that even \u201cpeaceful, legitimate debate could be dragged into the clutches of a security state.\u201d That could undermine the government\u2019s efforts and drive true extremists deeper underground, he said.\n\nSome Muslims say they have been unfairly singled out and that Prevent has increased distrust of the government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe program is \u201cvery subjective, and it very much depends on which eyes are looking,\u201d said Mohammed Khaliel, an independent adviser to the Metropolitan Police in Prevent-related matters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disproportionately focused on Muslims when the government says it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. Occasional news reports about children being interrogated over spelling mistakes (living in a \u201cterrorist\u201d instead of \u201cterraced\u201d house, in one recent case) has stoked further anger, he added.\n\nThe London-based Waltham Forest Council of Mosques, which represents 70,000 worshipers, said in a statement that it had \u201cno confidence in Prevent\u201d and called the program racist. It reacted angrily to a questionnaire distributed by the Waltham Forest Council last year that asked primary-school children about their beliefs. Children were asked to respond to statements including: \u201cReligious books are to be understood word for word,\u201d \u201cI believe my religion is the only correct one,\u201d and \u201cI would do what a grown-up told me to do even if it seemed odd to me.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the Blackburn schoolboy, his lawyer said he knew that what he had done was wrong, but the presiding judge said that the teenager had paid only \u201clip service\u201d to attempts to reform him.\n\nThe boy is being put through a mandatory program in a youth detention center and may be released from custody in five years, but only if he is considered purged of Islamic State views.", "summary": "The Prevent program, started by Prime Minister Tony Blair in the aftermath of the July 7, 2005, London bombings, encourages and in some cases requires Britons to watch for signs of radicalization in their communities and to alert the authorities about people who could become risks, before they turn violent.
