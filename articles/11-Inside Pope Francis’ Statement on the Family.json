The experience of the broad oriental tradition of a married clergy could also be drawn upon.\n\nParagraph 203 Broader Training for Priests \u201cSeminarians should receive a more extensive interdisciplinary, and not merely doctrinal, formation in the areas of engagement and marriage. Their training does not always allow them to explore their own psychological and affective background and experiences. Some come from troubled families, with absent parents and a lack of emotional stability. There is a need to ensure that the formation process can enable them to attain the maturity and psychological balance needed for their future ministry.\u201d\n\nParagraph 226 Encouraging Young Couples \u201cYoung married couples should be encouraged to develop a routine that gives a healthy sense of closeness and stability through shared daily rituals. These could include a morning kiss, an evening blessing, waiting at the door to welcome each other home, taking trips together and sharing household chores. Yet it also helps to break the routine with a party, and to enjoy family celebrations of anniversaries and special events. We need these moments of cherishing God\u2019s gifts and renewing our zest for life.\u201d\n\nParagraph 237 Reviving Injured Marriages \u201cAt times, all it takes to decide that everything is over is a single instance of dissatisfaction, the absence of the other when he or she was most needed, wounded pride, or a vague fear. Inevitably, situations will arise involving human weakness and these can prove emotionally overwhelming. One spouse may not feel fully appreciated, or may be attracted to another person. Jealousy and tensions may emerge, or new interests that consume the other\u2019s time and attention. Physical changes naturally occur in everyone. These, and so many other things, rather than threatening love, are so many occasions for reviving and renewing it.\u201d\n\nParagraph 250 Denounces Antigay Violence \u201cEvery person, regardless of sexual orientation, ought to be respected in his or her dignity and treated with consideration, while \u2018every sign of unjust discrimination\u2019 is to be carefully avoided,276 particularly any form of aggression and violence. Such families should be given respectful pastoral guidance, so that those who manifest a homosexual orientation can receive the assistance they need to understand and fully carry out God\u2019s will in their lives.\u201d\n\nParagraph 251 Rejection of Same-Sex Marriage \u201cIn discussing the dignity and mission of the family, the Synod Fathers observed that, \u2018as for proposals to place unions between homosexual persons on the same level as marriage, there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God\u2019s plan for marriage and family.\u2019 It is unacceptable \u2018that local Churches should be subjected to pressure in this matter and that international bodies should make financial aid to poor countries dependent on the introduction of laws to establish \u2018marriage\u2019 between persons of the same sex.\u2019\u201d\n\nParagraph 252 On Single Parents \u201cWhatever the cause, single parents must receive encouragement and support from other families in the Christian community, and from the parish\u2019s pastoral outreach. Often these families endure other hardships, such as economic difficulties, uncertain employment prospects, problems with child support and lack of housing.\u201d\n\nParagraph 283 Questioning \u2018Safe Sex\u2019 Message \u201cFrequently, sex education deals primarily with \u2018protection\u2019 through the practice of \u2018safe sex.\u2019 Such expressions convey a negative attitude towards the natural procreative finality of sexuality, as if an eventual child were an enemy to be protected against. This way of thinking promotes narcissism and aggressivity in place of acceptance.\u201d\n\nParagraph 300 New Route Back for Divorced Catholics \u201cIf we consider the immense variety of concrete situations such as those I have mentioned, it is understandable that neither the Synod nor this Exhortation could be expected to provide a new set of general rules, canonical in nature and applicable to all cases. What is possible is simply a renewed encouragement to undertake a responsible personal and pastoral discernment of particular cases, one which would recognize that, since \u2018the degree of responsibility is not equal in all cases,\u2019 335 the consequences or effects of a rule need not necessarily always be the same.336 Priests have the duty to \u201caccompany [the divorced and remarried] in helping them to understand their situation according to the teaching of the Church and the guidelines of the bishop. Useful in this process is an examination of conscience through moments of reflection and repentance. The divorced and remarried should ask themselves: how did they act towards their children when the conjugal union entered into crisis; whether or not they made attempts at reconciliation; what has become of the abandoned party\u2026.\u201d"}
