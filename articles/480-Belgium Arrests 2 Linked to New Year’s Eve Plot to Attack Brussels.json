Officers now patrol in groups of two or more, with at least one member armed, around the headquarters.

But the festivities, which could draw as many as 50,000 visitors, will be closely guarded by police officers and soldiers, a spokesman for the mayor said. Visitors will not be allowed to bring fireworks, bottles or pets.\n\nNine men have been charged in Belgium in connection with the Paris attacks, and a global manhunt continues for Salah Abdeslam, a Belgian-born Frenchman who is believed to be the only survivor among those who directly participated in the attacks.\n\nOne week after the attacks in Paris, the Belgian authorities expressed concern that the threat of a similar terrorist attack in Brussels was \u201cserious and imminent.\u201d\n\nThe police raided several homes throughout the country and arrested 16 people, 15 of whom were released the next day without being charged. Although no arms or explosives were found during those raids, the authorities said they had averted a major terrorist attack.", "summary": "Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
