Fears were highest in Hungary and Poland.\n\nIn Poland, the right-wing government is already locked in bitter disputes with the European Union over freedom of speech and the rule of law.\n\nAs the grisly details in Nice became clear, Poland\u2019s interior minister swiftly blamed \u201cdecades of multi-culti policy\u201d and those \u201cwho lit up the Eiffel Tower\u201d after earlier attacks in Paris.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t learned anything from terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, when those in power just burst into tears,\u201d the minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, told Polsat News, a private TV channel. \u201cWe need to focus on guaranteeing people\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is best done, he argued, by emulating Poland and Hungary, keeping migrants out and preventing crime.\n\n\u201cWe, unlike Western Europe, don\u2019t experience such problems; we don\u2019t have districts ruled by a different law than Polish law; we don\u2019t have no-go zones that Polish police cannot enter,\u201d Mr. Blaszczak said, alluding to debunked reports of such areas in Western Europe.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That contest pits a former Green Party leader against a far-right politician, Norbert Hofer, who could become the first rightist elected head of state in Europe since 1945.\n\nEven if Mr. Hofer does not prevail, his Freedom party is still No. 1 in opinion polls in Austria, well ahead of the mainstream parties that have governed Austria since 1945 but were eliminated in the first round of presidential voting in April.\n\nEven in prosperous and conservative Germany, Europe\u2019s No. 1 power, politics have become more fractured. The far-right Alternative for Germany, mired in internal disputes, has slipped to between 9 percent and 12 percent in opinion polls, down from 15 percent. But that is still well above the 5 percent barrier for winning seats in next year\u2019s national elections.\n\nSupport for Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative bloc has strengthened slightly since the British referendum, as the public saw the economic and political aftermath of that vote.\n\nBut Ms. Merkel is still widely blamed for a policy that allowed some one million migrants to arrive in Germany last year. Desperate to stanch the flow, she enlisted Turkey to help keep migrants from entering Europe. How that agreement will fare now that Turkey\u2019s military has tried to unseat President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was one of many open questions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Britain, one of the biggest challenges facing Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s new government is how to balance a desire for continued access to the European single market with the European Union\u2019s requirement of open-border policies that allow European citizens to live and work anywhere they please within the bloc. Shutting off immigration was one of the most powerful motives behind the vote to leave the European Union, and the attack in Nice seemed likely to harden the position of those advocating strict border control.\n\nWell before the British referendum, the refugee crisis had put an acute strain on European unity, and in particular on Europe\u2019s Schengen border-free travel zone. The attacker in Nice was living in France legally.\n\nBut the assault followed other terror attacks in which some attackers had crossed the Belgian-French border, and two of the attackers in the assault on Paris in November had apparently entered Europe in last year\u2019s migrant wave.\n\nAs a result, criticisms of Europe\u2019s open-border policies have taken root not just on the far right but among more mainstream parties.\n\n\u201cAll the Schengen countries have now free circulation of people,\u201d Pierre Lellouche, a former minister and member of France\u2019s center-right Republican party, told the BBC on Friday. \u201cBut it is turning into free circulation of terrorists. We don\u2019t know who enters.\u201d\n\nAs for improving border control or sharing more information among European intelligence agencies, he added: \u201cNothing is happening.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cThis was in one of the most famous holiday destinations in Europe, and the images were so horrific that it does feed into this general sense of insecurity that populist parties trade off,\u201d said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research institute.
