But his efforts got little attention in the French news media in the aftermath of the Paris attacks.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Cazeneuve announced that 2,800 extra police officers would be assigned to the climate conference\u2019s 40-acre site just outside Paris, where about 60 pavilions and restaurants have been built.\n\nMr. Cazeneuve said that mobile police force units, including riot police officers, \u201cwill be deployed at an unprecedented level, in Paris and in the provinces, to assure public order and to prevent any misbehavior.\u201d\n\nIn Belgium on Thursday, the authorities lowered a terrorism alert that had paralyzed Brussels, the nation\u2019s capital, declaring that the threat of a Paris-style assault was still \u201cserious\u201d but no longer \u201cimminent.\u201d\n\nThe decision to reduce the threat level to 3, from the highest level, 4, lifted a mood of foreboding that had gripped Brussels since last weekend, but left intact a mystery over what information had led to initial government warnings of a \u201cserious and imminent\u201d threat. Also unclear was what had changed since.\n\nThe fact that at least one of the suspects in the Paris attacks remains at large, possibly in Belgium, has added to a lingering sense of insecurity. On the other hand, experts said Wednesday, from a security point of view, the climate conference comes at an ideal time, since France is already on maximum alert.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we will be able to go further in terms of security measures,\u201d said Jean-Charles Brisard, a security consultant and terrorism expert. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do, in terms of the state of emergency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an attempt to limit the use of private vehicles, the authorities also announced on Wednesday that public transportation would be free on Sunday and Monday and that some major highways around Paris would be closed.\n\nIn one sign of how the attacks have pushed the climate change conference from the top concerns of French leaders, the topic of the conference did not come up in a discussion lasting over an hour and a half this week when Prime Minister Manuel Valls hosted correspondents.\n\nSecurity, and the need to prepare French people for heightened danger in their country, dominated the prime minister\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to prepare the French for this new situation,\u201d Mr. Valls said. \u201cWatch out, live with it. We could suffer new attacks.\u201d", "summary": "Yet as Mr. Fabius proudly noted recently, none of the dozens of heads of state expected have renounced their plans to come to the conference, the largest diplomatic gathering held in France since 1948, and several who were tardy in replying have now said they will attend.
