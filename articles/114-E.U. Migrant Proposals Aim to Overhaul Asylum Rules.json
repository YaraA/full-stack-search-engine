Underlining those fears, Frontex, the bloc\u2019s border agency, said on Wednesday that two of the terrorists who carried out the Paris attacks in November had used fake Syrian papers on the Greek island of Leros before traveling to other parts of Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe episode highlights \u201cthe growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters,\u201d and it is \u201ca dreadful reminder that border management also has an important security component,\u201d Fabrice Leggeri, the executive director of Frontex, wrote in an introduction to an annual report.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

That figure included crossings by people who were counted for the first time when arriving on the Greek islands from Turkey and were counted again when crossing one of the bloc\u2019s external borders in the Western Balkans, such as between Greece and Macedonia.\n\nMore than half of the people detected at the bloc\u2019s external borders in 2015 were Syrians, the agency said. Afghans made up 27 percent of the total and Iraqis about 8 percent, it said.\n\nOnce Greece and Turkey take additional legal steps to allow the return of asylum seekers, another part of the agreement will go into full effect: a measure to allow one Syrian refugee in Turkey to be flown to Europe for every Syrian who is deported from Greece.\n\nThe agreement with Turkey was meant to improve the asylum process and to reduce the incentives to use human traffickers. Officials have reported that the number of people trying to cross the Aegean Sea has slowed considerably since the deal was struck with Turkey on March 18.\n\nAsked about the prospects for the full carrying out of the deal with Turkey, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration, said talks were continuing with Ankara to ensure that all returned asylum seekers are adequately protected.\n\n\u201cWe are still in the beginning; the numbers are very low,\u201d Mr. Avramopoulos said at the news conference, referring to the number of people who have been returned to Turkey so far.", "summary": "It broke down last year because Greece, the entry point for most migrants, was unable to cope on its own, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, allowed hundreds of thousands of people to stay in Germany even though they had failed to register elsewhere.
