{"title": "Far-Right Gains Leave Germans Wondering, What Now?", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/world/europe/germany-election-far-right.html", "body": "At the very least, the vote has forced many Germans to realize that their country, despite its past, is not immune to the tug of nationalism and populism that has challenged liberal democracies across Europe and in the United States.\n\nMany Germans bridled at the thought. Within minutes of the election results, German-speaking social media responded with a campaign promoting the 87 percent who did not elect the far-right.\n\nSome noted the comparison with the United States, where a right-wing populist, Donald J. Trump, won the election, or France, where the far right made it to the final round of presidential voting this year.\n\nCompared with many of its European neighbors, Germany\u2019s far-right force remains a minority. But an analysis of the returns also shows that in all but one of 299 polling districts the AfD earned at least 5 percent, reflecting widespread, if not necessarily deep, support.\n\nAlternative for Germany Got Most Support from East German states Share of vote for Alternative for Germany 25-30 >30% 10-15 15-20 20-25 <5 5-10\n\nThat revelation is a sobering reality for those Germans who believed that liberal democracy was an unshakable moral compass for their modern, reunified country.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cNow I have the impression there is no longer any consensus anymore,\u201d Ms. Schindler said.\n\nGermany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has warned against allowing the vote to drive a wedge in society, insisting that now is not the time for anyone \u201cto retreat to their own niche shaking their heads.\u201d\n\nBut the map of where the AfD enjoyed its strongest support also reveals clear lines of division that have split the country throughout its history.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne is the divide between the largely Roman Catholic southern states, where conservatives turned their backs on Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union.\n\nThe other cuts along the former East-West border of the Cold War, with support for the AfD by far strongest in the former East Germany, where the party also made its strongest showing ever in regional elections last year.\n\nJohannes Staemmler, now in his mid-30s, was born and raised in Dresden, the capital of the eastern state of Saxony, where the AfD emerged as the strongest force, with 27 percent of the vote.\n\nFrom his home in Berlin, he recognized immediately whom Mr. Gauland meant by \u201cour people\u201d \u2014 it was his former schoolmates, neighbors and family members in the east.\n\nIn the first two decades following reunification, the region\u2019s population dropped by two million, many of them young people like him who had moved west looking for jobs.\n\nReferring to an idea laid out by J. D. Vance in the book \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d Mr. Staemmler said that while church, family and country serve as mainstays of community in the American Midwest, such anchors are missing in the former Communist east.\n\n\u201cIn the east, there is no church, families are splintered because so many young people have moved away and the state is not viewed as representing them,\u201d Mr. Staemmler said.\n\n\u201cSo when Gauland says, \u2018let\u2019s be proud of Germany, let\u2019s take back our country, let\u2019s put our country first,\u2019 he is serving their need for identity, for community,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nOthers placed the blame squarely on Ms. Merkel.\n\n\u201cThrough the gutting of her party, in which she drove out any and all conservative positions, she opened up space on the right fringe, sending unhappy conservatives into the arms of right-wing populists,\u201d Stefan Kuzmany wrote in an editorial commentary in Spiegel Online.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill others lay the fault not with the policies of the governing parties but with their inability to take the far right seriously. They never stopped to consider what made the party attractive to voters.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

An investigation by the influential left-leaning Die Zeit found that roughly a third of the AfD\u2019s 93 lawmakers can be considered nationalist conservatives, along the lines of Mr. Gauland, their far-right leader.\n\nAn additional 13 AfD lawmakers were found to have ties to extreme-right political groups, including the Identit\u00e4ren, who are under observation by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence service.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMartin Hohmann is the only AfD lawmaker to have previously served in the German Parliament, until he was kicked out of the Christian Democrats in 2003, for blaming Jews for the deaths caused by the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe return of such voices to Parliament has caused concern among many Jews in Germany and Europe.\n\nJosef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called on the centrist forces in the German Parliament to defend their democratic values and resist the attempts by the AfD to provoke them.\n\n\n\n\u201cI expect our democratic powers to reveal the true face of the AfD and expose the empty, populist promises of the party,\u201d Mr. Schuster said.\n\nWhile some have branded the AfD Nazis \u2014 in the weeks before the vote Sigmar Gabriel, the foreign minister said \u201creal Nazis\u201d would be entering Parliament \u2014 others warn that the term does not necessarily shed light on the new populist movement in Europe.\n\n\u201cThere is a hard-right core that is extremely nationalistic, but unlike the Nazis, not murderously nationalistic,\u201d said Michael Wolffsohn, a professor of modern history at the University of the German Armed Forces in Munich.\n\nMuch of the far right\u2019s emergence had to do with the anxieties provoked by a \u201cdemographic revolution,\u201d Mr. Wolffsohn said. \u201cChange frightens many people.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen fear grows, irrationality grows. That is at the heart of this new right-wing phenomenon.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of those who will represent the AfD in Parliament are virtual political unknowns, leaving some Germans to take a wait-and-see approach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the AfD has vowed to be a disruptive force in Parliament, Mr. Gauland acknowledged the responsibility the party now faces.\n\n\u201cOf course the language of an election campaign is different than the language in Parliament,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers hoped that a turn in government would ultimately lead the AfD to self-destruct, or self-correct.\n\n\u201cThe Left Party was just as despised early on, or even the Greens,\u201d Mr. Hoffmann said. \u201cToday, it\u2019s the AfD, and if they have any sense, they will expel the extreme forces from their party and become just a typical conservative party.\u201d"}
