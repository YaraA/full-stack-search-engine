But the outbreak of the Arab Spring in 2011 changed the strategy, as well as public attitudes.\n\nWaves of refugees risking their lives to make passage to Europe stirred global sympathy. In response, Italy suspended the pushback operations, and then a landmark 2012 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights barred Italy from continuing the tactic.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have people fleeing war \u2014 young children, fathers, mothers \u2014 and drowning within sight of Europe,\u201d said Leonard Doyle, spokesman for the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t acceptable.\u201d\n\nAfter a shipwreck last October, in which more than 300 migrants died within a few hundred yards of the Italian island of Lampedusa, the government announced the creation of Mare Nostrum, the search-and-rescue program.\n\nWith Italian leaders loudly calling for help and money, European officials last month announced that Frontex would be expanded in November to include rescue efforts. But few details have been provided, even as Italian officials say the new initiative will allow Italy to end Mare Nostrum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Italian government is telling Italians that Mare Nostrum will be replaced,\u201d said Bruce Leimsidor, an expert on European asylum law at Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice. \u201cBut if you look at the statements by European officials, they are talking about supplementing. They are not talking about replacing Mare Nostrum.\u201d\n\nAlong the southeastern coast of Sicily, small cities have hurriedly opened holding centers, including an abandoned school in the port city of Augusta that now houses unaccompanied teenage boys. Many of them had left Gambia and Ghana, and even Bangladesh, to work as migrants in oil-rich Libya. But as Libya has steadily unraveled into anarchy and violence, they feared for their lives.\n\n\u201cThey can kill you at any moment, any second,\u201d said Ibrima, a 17-year-old from Gambia, who worked in Libya before paying smugglers to reach Italy in August.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said his father had two wives, and the second wife, jealous of Ibrima\u2019s mother, doused him with scalding oil.\n\n\u201cHere is now my country,\u201d he said of Italy. \u201cI want to stay here.\u201d\n\nOut on the commercial ports of Augusta and Pozzallo, the Italian naval frigates deliver newly rescued migrants almost every day.\n\nMigrants cling to suitcases or plastic bags bearing their remaining worldly possessions. A handwritten note, scrawled in Egyptian dialect on a torn cigarette pack, was discovered on the ground last week in Pozzallo as migrants filed off a ship. It was from someone initialed \u201cA\u201d to someone else initialed \u201cR.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to be with you,\u201d read the note. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare forget me. I love you very much. My wish is for you not to forget me. Be well my love. A loves R. I love you.\u201d\n\nOne man on the ship, Mohannad Sharouf, 38, an English teacher, had fled Swedea, in Syria, because he said he became a target of the security forces of President Bashar al-Assad. \u201cEven if the E.U. takes different measures, they can\u2019t stop immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Syria, I had my fianc\u00e9e, my family and friends. I had my whole life there. Do you think, had I a choice, I would have left?\u201d\n\nDown the coast in Pozzallo, another major processing point for incoming migrants, Mayor Luigi Ammatuna and his chief of staff, Virginia Giugno, now spend much of their time dealing with the bureaucratic and emotional tasks of migration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ammatuna has gone on Italian radio to debate immigration opponents, asking if they have ever seen what he sees every day. Ms. Giugno, who has two children, is now listed as the legal guardian of all the roughly 150 unaccompanied minors who have arrived in Pozzallo.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what mothers and fathers go through when they put an 11-year-old boy on a boat and say, \u2018Good luck,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThey know they will never see them again, that they may die at sea.\u201d\n\nDeath has become one of the city\u2019s bureaucratic tasks. In July, the Navy rescued a wooden ship overcrowded with migrants. When the hatch was opened, Navy sailors discovered that 48 people inside the hull had suffocated. Pozzallo officials created a makeshift morgue by attaching refrigeration units to an empty room at the city\u2019s civil protection center. Bodies were also placed inside a refrigerated truck ordinarily used to transport freshly cut flowers.\n\nThe bodies from Monday\u2019s funeral arrived on a migrant boat in August. So many migrants have now been interred in Pozzallo that officials had to distribute some of the dead for burial at cemeteries in nearby towns such as Ragusa and Modica. The two men buried in Modica, Moussa Conde, 23, and Amadou Conde, 24, from Conakry, Guinea, may have been related.\n\nSicily has known suffering and deprivation, and once saw its own youth flee poverty to emigrate to better opportunities, in places including the United States. Monday\u2019s funeral in Pozzallo was held outdoors because there were too many bodies to fit into the cemetery\u2019s small chapel. A few dozen residents joined the officials, including Claudia Scala, 42, who felt compelled to come since the families of the migrants could not be there.\n\n\u201cThese people have nobody,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018At least they can have me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe service was especially bittersweet for Vincenza Angieleri, 64. Her husband died working on an oil tanker that wrecked off the coast of North Carolina 37 years ago. Search crews never found his body.\n\n\u201cIt is a duty for people who live here to come to this funeral,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter the color of their skin. It saddens us that something like this happened in our village.\u201d"}
