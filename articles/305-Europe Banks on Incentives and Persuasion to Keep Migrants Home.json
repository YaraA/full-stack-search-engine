The World Bank expects the nations of sub-Saharan Africa to receive about $33 billion in remittances this year alone, compared with nearly $47 billion in aid from nations around the world.\n\nThe deal includes a 1.8 billion euro fund (roughly $2 billion) for African countries from which migrants originate. In an effort to make it more palatable to Africans themselves, it also promises to double the number of university scholarships for African students and to offer new training opportunities for African entrepreneurs.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s top diplomat at the United Nations, Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, said that the deal being proposed was one that African leaders should embrace.\n\n\u201cIt is in their interest that we organize a joint response to the challenge,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe alternative, if they don\u2019t engage themselves as well, is we find ourselves in a situation where you would find very little, very little support for any kind of migration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s asking them to help us make that flow a politically sustainable operation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe sweeteners come on top of more punitive measures that Europe has already put into motion in an effort to stop the flow. There are fences along the border of Morocco and the Spanish city of Melilla, and joint maritime patrols along the Atlantic. More recently, European militaries have been authorized to patrol the international waters of the Mediterranean to inspect and seize boats suspected of human smuggling that depart from Libya.\n\nCritics liken those efforts to draining sand out of the Sahara.\n\nFor one thing, Europe makes it virtually impossible for Africans to live and work in Europe legally, giving them few options other than the illegal, often dangerous, route.\n\nVideo\n\nAmnesty International on Tuesday issued a scathing critique of the Valletta plan, saying that \u201cconcrete proposals on safe and legal routes are glaringly absent\u201d and worrying that asylum seekers might also be sent back without due process.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenegal\u2019s president, Macky Sall, made it clear that accepting returned migrants \u201cis a difficult subject\u201d for his continent. \u201cWe have people who have often taken chances with their lives in terrible conditions, who have crossed deserts and the Mediterranean,\u201d and there have been \u201cthousands of deaths,\u201d Mr. Sall told reporters Wednesday in Valletta.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a frank discussion,\u201d said Mr. Sall, who emphasized that there also needed to be a focus on allowing Africans to stay in Europe.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many African economies, including those from which the migrants come, are growing fast, she pointed out, but doing little to create decent jobs for young citizens who aspire to a better life.\n\n\u201cAfrica boasts incredible growth rates, but what it really needs is inclusive growth,\u201d she wrote in a blog post on the Chatham House website. \u201cIn its absence, European authorities cannot hope to control illegal migration.\u201d\n\nThe summit meeting itself hints at the vast gulf between the two continents on how to tackle migration. For Europe, keeping out economic migrants is an urgent political priority. For Africa, the exodus of young, ambitious men is potentially a political relief valve and an economic lift. It not only brings in cash, but also provides an exit route for frustrated young men who, as a recent report by the International Crisis Group notes, have no decent job prospects nor \u201creal loyalty to the state.\u201d\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\n\u201cMany youths see migration \u2014 illegal if necessary \u2014 as their only future,\u201d the report says.\n\nEuropean capitals have historically had little success in sending home failed asylum seekers. A small share of them agree to return voluntarily, usually with a package of cash incentives facilitated by the International Organization for Migration. Most remain in Europe in the shadows.\n\nNow, with the surge of Syrian and other refugees from war, whom Europe is obliged to take, the continent\u2019s leaders are under intense pressure to draw a clear line against those who have no such legal protections \u2014 and to send them back home.\n\nDrawing such a clear line may not be easy. According to figures from the migration organization, of the 141,000 people estimated to have crossed the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy so far this year, the largest single group is from Eritrea, one of the most repressive countries in the world. Others come from Nigeria, Mali and Sudan, countries torn by conflict as well.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe aid money that the European Union is expected to announce in Valletta this week \u2014 some of the \u20ac1.8 billion over the next several years is repackaged aid that Europe had already promised \u2014 is intended to spur economic opportunities in the migrants\u2019 home countries, including vocational training. But the money is also meant to be used for what the draft action plan calls \u201cmigration management, including containing and preventing irregular migration.\u201d\n\nMr. Loprete, the migration organization\u2019s director in Niger, took pains to point out that his center, which is financed by European donors, does not force anyone to return. It seeks instead, he said, to inform the migrants of the real risks that lie ahead \u2014 including getting stuck in Libya for months, which is what often happens \u2014 and to give them reasons to stay in the region. In the past, migrants returning home were sometimes offered a sewing machine to start a new business, or aid workers would help build water wells in their arid villages.\n\nHis agency is now hoping to arm migrants with skills to make a better living closer to home \u2014 hence the school to teach them how to make bricks with sand and plastic.\n\n\u201cThey have sand everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately they have plastic everywhere,\u201d too.\n\nMr. Loprete is keenly aware that it is not easy to talk someone out of following a dream. Not long ago, he said, he met a young man who was trying to get on a boat to Italy. It was his sixth try."}
