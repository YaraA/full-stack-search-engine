{"title": "French Premier\u2019s Push Toward Center Opens Rift on the Left", "authors": ["Liz Alderman", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/world/europe/france-premier-manuel-valls-push-toward-center-opens-rift-on-the-left.html", "body": "Even as momentum builds against the austerity policies that Germany has pushed on the eurozone, the question remains whether Europe can afford the welfare systems that have defined the left for generations and that critics blame for ushering in the debt crisis in the first place. But if the left now backs away from its ideological touchstones, then what does it stand for?\n\nMr. Valls is trying to answer that challenge by calling on his party to embrace policies that emphasize growth over social protections as Europe\u2019s leaders look for ways to stimulate their economies. He has forged a new solidarity axis with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, who has embraced freer markets and labor reforms but, like Mr. Valls, is also seeking to push back against deeper cuts in public spending.\n\nAt a social-democratic rally in Bologna, Italy, this month, both men appeared tieless and in matching white shirts, hugging each other and promising to \u201cunblock Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cRenzi and Valls have broken with the old European Socialism the way Blair did,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a political scientist who studies the left in France. \u201cValls is trying to embody a real modernization of the Socialist Party, by challenging the state and putting more confidence in the markets.\u201d\n\nSo far, it has not been easy. In the cabinet reshuffle last month, Mr. Hollande ousted Arnaud Montebourg, a populist economy minister, and replaced him with Emmanuel Macron, a wealthy former banker at Rothschild who is seen as more friendly to business.\n\nThe moves left the traditional base of the Socialist Party feeling angry and betrayed. Yet to critics elsewhere, the changes still felt like an unsatisfying attempt to split the difference between setting a new direction for the party and remaining true to old Socialist ideals.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that Hollande and Valls don\u2019t embody anything at all,\u201d said the French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d explores social inequality in France and elsewhere. \u201cThey are trying to make people believe that Germany is the only country responsible for the catastrophic austerity policy which has plunged the eurozone into stagnation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBut in truth,\u201d he added, \u201cthe problem is that they are scared of any progress in terms of policy and budgetary union at the eurozone level, which would yet be the only solution to get out of the crisis,\u201d but was likely to require future trimming of the state to meet the European Union\u2019s requirements.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In his 2010 book, \u201cPower,\u201d Mr. Valls emphasized the \u201cexhaustion\u201d of the social-democratic model, which he described as a confusing mix of left and right policies. \u201cEven worse,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is the left that is now incapable of rejuvenating the welfare state by adapting it to the realities of our time.\u201d\n\nJean-Jacques Urvoas, a Socialist legislator and a close friend of Mr. Valls\u2019s, called him a \u201cprickly\u201d man with a \u201cmodernist\u201d approach. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t kowtow to the great figures of the left; he is an iconoclast,\u201d Mr. Urvoas said.\n\nMr. Valls fashions himself as a torchbearer for the center, seeking peace with the business community and revisiting bedrock Socialist tenets like France\u2019s 35-hour workweek. If Mr. Hollande\u2019s mandate grows weaker, there is little doubt that Mr. Valls will try to pick up the mantle for the Socialist Party heading into France\u2019s 2017 presidential race.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have that soft image that Hollande does; in that sense he\u2019s viewed as more presidential,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cFor now, he must follow Hollande\u2019s policies. But if the captain of the ship has to bow out because he is too weak, he would fancy himself taking a crack at it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the latest polls show Mr. Valls losing popularity, too, and if the government\u2019s tilt toward the center does not produce better economic results, he will be deeply discredited.\n\nTo shore up his Socialist credentials, Mr. Valls has taken pains to address \u201cthe French who are suffering.\u201d But Mr. Valls is also limited in how much he can go beyond the policies already outlined by Mr. Hollande. For now, the two men are, perhaps uncomfortably, joined at the hip.\n\nWhile Mr. Hollande has made clear he will not impose new austerity measures, Mr. Valls must still persuade left-leaning members of their Socialist Party to sign off on cuts of 50 billion euros, or about $65 billion, already pledged through 2017 \u2014 something that will remain a hurdle even if the confidence vote passes on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s politically tough to do when you have a left wing of the Socialist Party that want no cuts of any kind in the social welfare state,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cThat\u2019s where Valls\u2019s main political fight will be.\u201d"}
