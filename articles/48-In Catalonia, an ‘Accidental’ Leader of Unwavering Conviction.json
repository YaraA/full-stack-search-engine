He still commutes from the city of Girona, with a population of only around 100,000, where he was mayor. He compares running the government headquarters in Barcelona to sitting in an electric chair.\n\nCatalonia\u2019s previous leader, Artur Mas, was fined and barred from public office for organizing a nonbinding independence ballot in 2014. But Mr. Mas was a late convert to the separatist cause.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy \u2014 who was already a government minister two decades ago \u2014 thought the comparatively green Mr. Puigdemont would be more pliable, that has not been the case.\n\nMr. Puigdemont says he is determined to have Catalans vote on Sunday. He also says he will leave Barcelona \u2014 and possibly politics \u2014 as soon as independence is assured, \u201cto recover a certain lost normality.\u201d\n\nFor now, nothing is normal, for Catalonia or for Spain.\n\nThe referendum on Sunday won\u2019t take place in the normal voting conditions, if it comes off at all. With the backing of Spanish courts, Madrid is doing all it can to block the vote. The Spanish police have confiscated ballot papers and other election-related material and are under orders to keep polling stations closed.\n\nShould the referendum be thwarted, Mr. Puigdemont is certain to shift the blame for Spain\u2019s constitutional crisis more firmly onto Mr. Rajoy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has already accused the conservative prime minister of ignoring Catalans in the name of a Spanish Constitution that has run its course, after enshrining Spain\u2019s democratic transition in 1978, following the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.\n\n\u201cWith Rajoy, there is a taboo topic, which is the aspiration of Catalonia to decide its future,\u201d Mr. Puigdemont said. \u201cIt\u2019s very irresponsible to deny the reality of a problem to see whether it might stop existing.\u201d\n\nMr. Puigdemont has recently managed to move the debate from the issue of independence \u2014 which has split Catalans and for which there has not been majority backing \u2014 to arguments over whether voters have a right to decide on statehood, which most Catalans want to do, according to opinion polls.\n\nMr. Rajoy, however, has stood his ground, as the guardian of Spanish unity and defender of the rule of law against Catalan civil disobedience. The referendum is a \u201ccrazy\u201d project, Mr. Rajoy said at a news conference with President Trump this week in Washington. \u201cAll this will lead to is noise,\u201d he said.\n\nThat noise is already getting louder. Mr. Rajoy accuses the separatists of encouraging civil disobedience, while Mr. Puigdemont compares the Madrid-ordered clampdown to Franco\u2019s authoritarianism.\n\nWith no sign that the two leaders will return to the negotiating table before Sunday, Catalonia is becoming increasingly tense.\n\nMadrid has sent thousands of police officers to Catalonia, saying they are there to prevent unrest, even as Mr. Puigdemont promises that Catalans won\u2019t turn violent. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to avoid either the temptation or provocation of violence,\u201d he said.\n\nXevi Xirgo, director of a newspaper, El Punt Avui, who worked with Mr. Puigdemont in the late 1980s, said that even then Mr. Puigdemont was pushing to allocate more space to any news item related to self-determination, however anodyne it appeared.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Rajoy can invoke emergency powers to suspend Mr. Puigdemont and give Madrid full administrative control over Catalonia, though such a step could provoke a backlash.\n\nWhen pressed, Mr. Puigdemont is coy about how he could actually form a new Catalan state, given the additional difficulty of gaining recognition for any independence declaration from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThere is no button that you push and the next day you become independent,\u201d he said.\n\nThe acrimonious breakdown in the relationship between Madrid and Barcelona has baffled most observers.\n\nA few months after taking office, Mr. Puigdemont visited Mr. Rajoy for the first time. The meeting seemed cordial, and Mr. Rajoy gave Mr. Puigdemont a facsimile of part of the first edition of \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d in which the legendary knight-errant travels to Barcelona.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Puigdemont never received a follow-up invitation, he said, after he made clear to Mr. Rajoy his commitment to an independence referendum.\n\nThe two met last month, but to pay homage to the victims of the terrorism attacks in Barcelona rather than discuss Spain\u2019s territorial crisis.\n\n\u201cIt seems pretty weird that a person with his experience is reaching the end of his career without having tried to engage in politics\u201d over the Catalan issue, Mr. Puigdemont said of Mr. Rajoy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf the government in Madrid \u201chad deployed the same efforts in politics as they have in now deploying policemen, we wouldn\u2019t have got here,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Rajoy told Parliament that he could not negotiate with a Catalan leader who flouts the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIn Spain, there\u2019s somebody trying to end national sovereignty and inventing a parallel jurisdiction,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to avoid this folly \u2014 that\u2019s the priority \u2014 and after that I\u2019ve got no problem talking.\u201d\n\nIt does not help that both men are in vulnerable political positions.\n\nMr. Rajoy runs a minority government and his political survival is now at stake. Mr. Puigdemont leads a fragile coalition of separatist parties, which disagree profoundly on economic and social issues and what kind of Catalan state they want to build.\n\n\u201cPuigdemont is not seeking power \u2014 he took this job with a single idea in mind, to lead Catalonia to independence,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Antich, director of El Nacional, a Catalan online newspaper. \u201cHis top priorities are independence, independence and independence. It\u2019s not about also improving education or creating a better government.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he was force-feeding voters the promise of statehood without first explaining how a Catalan republic would function, Mr. Puigdemont argued that the new Catalonia would be discussed if and when the project was approved.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, you know that you want to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s on the menu \u2014 perhaps it\u2019s not your favorite dish \u2014 but you will eat.\u201d"}
