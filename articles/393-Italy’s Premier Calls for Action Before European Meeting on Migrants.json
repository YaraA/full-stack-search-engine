A steady stream of boats has been arriving daily to its shores, confronting the country and the European Union with a humanitarian crisis.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cEither we have policies,\u201d he told the lower house of Italy\u2019s Parliament, \u201cor we go nowhere.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are asking Europe to be Europe, not just when it\u2019s time to devise a budget.\u201d\n\nMr. Renzi called for the European Union to have a more coordinated strategy, including expanding search-and-rescue patrols and taking action against smugglers in Libya and elsewhere, whom he referred to as \u201c21st-century slave drivers.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe also evoked an idea that has previously circulated in Brussels: the establishment of migration centers in African countries, in cooperation with the United Nations, so that would-be migrants could apply for asylum in the European Union from their home countries rather than set off on potentially deadly journeys in search of refuge in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday, European leaders are expected to discuss proposals to double the size of search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean; increase the budget for Frontex, the European Union\u2019s border agency; improve cooperation between the police across the bloc; and intensify the battle against smugglers and human traffickers.\n\nEuropean Union officials said on Wednesday that the current budget for the bloc\u2019s border protection operation, known as Triton, was about 3 million euros, or $3.2 million, a month, and that the operation\u2019s resources included two aircraft, two helicopters, six coastal patrol vessels and about 65 officers. Even doubling that would probably not be enough to deal with the scale of the migration crisis, analysts said."}
