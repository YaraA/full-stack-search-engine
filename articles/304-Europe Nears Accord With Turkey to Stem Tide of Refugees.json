But he also acknowledged that the details of raising the remaining \u20ac2.5 billion from individual member governments still needed to be settled.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Tusk of the European Council, which represents leaders of European Union member states, said he was \u201c99 percent sure\u201d that the summit meeting with Mr. Erdogan would take place at the end of November.\n\nAngela Merkel, the German chancellor, said summit meetings between the European Union and Turkey should not become a regular event. But the strains of the migration crisis on Europe were plain to see on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarlier in the day, Sweden defended its decision to reintroduce border controls as Europe\u2019s leaders also wrapped up an agreement to provide African nations with \u20ac1.8 billion intended to speed up the process of returning people to Africa who have not qualified for asylum and to discourage others who would not qualify from migrating.\n\nMacky Sall, the president of Senegal, in West Africa, said the deal could still \u201cbe improved\u201d and the fund \u201cmore generously financed.\u201d\n\nThe announcement from Sweden that it would reintroduce border controls came late on Wednesday, after a request earlier this month for concessions, already granted to Italy and Greece, that would allow the relocation of migrants to other European countries. The European authorities still are reviewing that request.\n\nThe Swedish prime minister, Stefan Lofven, framed the controls as a temporary measure by Sweden to maintain order. But the new controls represent a blow to the European policy of allowing free movement of people across most of the bloc\u2019s internal borders.\n\nThe move was not necessarily a sign that the open-border system in Europe had permanently broken down, Mr. Lofven said, but, \u201cwe need another system \u2014 that is obvious.\u201d\n\nGermany has warned it may not be able to accept some migrants over the long term, even from Syria, where a four-year war has displaced millions of people. Germany said it would take a stricter approach to admitting the relatives of refugees.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
