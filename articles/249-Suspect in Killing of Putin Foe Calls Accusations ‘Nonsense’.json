Lugovoi, a Russian entrepreneur and former K.G.B. bodyguard accused of poisoning Alexander V. Litvinenko with radioactive polonium 210, was quoted Wednesday as saying the charges that Russia was behind the killing were \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch evidence simply does not exist because Russia wasn\u2019t involved,\u201d Mr. Lugovoi told The Associated Press at his office in Russia\u2019s Parliament, where he became a lawmaker after the death in London on Nov. 23, 2006, of Mr. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer and bitter opponent of President Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cSecond, even if somebody had produced it, then I can only say that it\u2019s a fake and speculation.\u201d\n\nHis remarks were published as an oft-delayed public inquiry into Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s death entered a second day in London.
