They \u201cmark the end of a season that cast doubts over the Second Vatican Council, a season of some mistrust,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMany spoke about the council, criticized it as too weak and with too many compromises, but failed to feel the spirit of the council,\u201d he added. \u201cBoth popes were bishops at the council, not theologians.\u201d\n\nMr. Melloni said it was significant that Francis had bypassed the need for a second miracle attributed to John XXIII. Perhaps he decided \u201cthat the people of God have already made a judgment about the two popes,\u201d he added.\n\nAt John Paul II\u2019s beatification ceremony, which drew one and a half million people to Rome, Benedict lauded John Paul II as a central figure in the history of the 20th century and a hero of the church.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe was witness to the tragic age of big ideologies, totalitarian regimes, and from their passing John Paul II embraced the harsh suffering, marked by tension and contradictions, of the transition of the modern age toward a new phase of history, showing constant concern that the human person be its protagonist,\u201d Benedict said at the Mass.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile Benedict\u2019s first encyclical, \u201cGod Is Love,\u201d drew on the work of John Paul, Francis\u2019 first encyclical, \u201cLumen Fidei,\u201d or \u201cThe Light of Faith,\u201d released on Friday, is the first that the Vatican has openly acknowledged was written by two popes together. The encyclical calls on believers and seekers alike to explore how God can enrich their lives.\n\nIt also urges Catholics to uphold the church\u2019s conception of the family. \u201cThe first setting in which faith enlightened the human city is the family,\u201d Francis writes. \u201cI think first and foremost of the stable union of man and woman in marriage.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In addition to the Old Testament and the Gospel, the encyclical quotes Dante, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, T. S. Eliot and the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber.\n\nIt also touches on a passage in Fyodor Dostoyevsky\u2019s novel \u201cThe Idiot,\u201d in which Prince Myshkin sees the painting \u201cThe Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb\u201d by Hans Holbein the Younger and says, \u201cLooking at this painting might cause one to lose his faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet it is precisely in contemplating Jesus\u2019 death that faith grows stronger and receives a dazzling light,\u201d Francis writes.", "summary": "\u201cHe was witness to the tragic age of big ideologies, totalitarian regimes, and from their passing John Paul II embraced the harsh suffering, marked by tension and contradictions, of the transition of the modern age toward a new phase of history, showing constant concern that the human person be its protagonist,\u201d Benedict said at the Mass.
