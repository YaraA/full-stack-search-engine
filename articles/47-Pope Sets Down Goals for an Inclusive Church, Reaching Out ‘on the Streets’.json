{"title": "Pope Sets Down Goals for an Inclusive Church, Reaching Out \u2018on the Streets\u2019", "authors": ["Laurie Goodstein", "Elisabetta Povoledo"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/europe/in-major-document-pope-francis-present-his-vision.html", "body": "The document, called \u201cEvangelii Gaudium\u201d (the Joy of the Gospel), is an apostolic exhortation \u2014 less authoritative than an encyclical, but an important pronouncement. He drafted it in August in Spanish, said a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, as a reflection on a synod of bishops last year that took up the \u201cnew evangelization.\u201d\n\nFrancis\u2019 prescription for the church is inextricably tied up with his analysis of what is wrong with the world. He devotes many pages to denouncing the \u201cdictatorship\u201d of a global economic system and a free market that perpetuates inequality and \u201cdevours\u201d what is fragile, including human beings and the environment.\n\n\u201cHow can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points?\u201d he wrote, in the folksy language that has already marked his as a memorable papacy.\n\nVincent J. Miller, a theologian who writes on economic globalization at the University of Dayton, a Catholic university, said that while other popes have critiqued the economy, Francis has perspective on economic injustice as the first pope from Latin America, and is putting forward the church as the counterpoint.\n\n\u201cHe talks about an economy of exclusion, while he\u2019s been modeling and practicing inclusion publicly through his whole papacy,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\n\nAfter months in which many have parsed his comments for hints of change, the pope used the document to reiterate church teachings on abortion, homosexuality and the ordination of women. On abortion, he said, \u201cIt is not \u2018progressive\u2019 to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life. On the other hand, it is also true that we have done little to adequately accompany women in very difficult situations,\u201d who may seek abortions because of rape or extreme poverty.\n\nNowhere in the document did Francis speak explicitly of homosexuality or same-sex marriage. However, he said the church should not give in to \u201cmoral relativism,\u201d and cited with approval a document written by the bishops of the United States on ministering to people with \u201chomosexual inclination.\u201d The pope said the American bishops are right that the church must insist on \u201cobjective moral norms which are valid for everyone\u201d \u2014 even when the church is perceived by supporters of gay rights as promoting prejudice and interfering with individual freedom.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Francis said that both clergy and laypeople suffer from homilies: \u201cThe laity from having to listen to them, and the clergy from having to preach them! It is sad that this is the case.\u201d\n\nFrancis criticized those within the church who foster division to the point of \u201cveritable witch hunts.\u201d In recent years, some bishops in the United States and Europe have advocated denying the eucharist, or holy communion, to Catholic politicians who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage. Francis did not take up this issue directly, but he advocated open doors.\n\n\u201cEveryone can be part of the community, nor should the doors of the sacraments be closed for simply any reason,\u201d Francis said. \u201cThe eucharist, although it is the fullness of sacramental life, is not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak.\u201d\n\nFrancis proposed a vision of a decentralized church. Bishops and priests have a better sense of the needs of the faithful, he said. Parishes should be the point of \u201ccontact with the homes and the lives of its people,\u201d not a \u201cuseless structure out of touch with people or a self-absorbed cluster made up of a chosen few.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaypeople are, put simply, the vast majority of the people of God. The minority \u2014 ordained ministers \u2014 are at their service,\u201d Francis wrote.\n\nJohn Thavis, a former Vatican bureau chief for Catholic News Service, who wrote \u201cThe Vatican Diaries,\u201d said, \u201cHe\u2019s laying down some real markers about the kinds of reforms he expects to preside over, including greater decentralization, openness to diversity in the church, and a greater emphasis on the gospel message of salvation as opposed to church doctrines and rules.\u201d\n\nThe pope wrote that national bishops\u2019 conferences can be fruitful sounding boards.\n\nArchbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri, secretary general of the Synod of Bishops, noted Tuesday that the document made repeated references to documents drafted by various bishops\u2019 conferences \u2014 a first. It signals the will \u201cto allow the bishops of the world to participate in the leadership of the church,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rev. Antonio Spadaro, editor of the leading Jesuit journal in Rome, who interviewed the pope last summer just as Francis was writing the exhortation, said, \u201cIt is an ample and profound document,\u201d which finds its roots in the pope\u2019s personal history.\n\n\u201cBut it isn\u2019t complete,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see more.\u201d"}
