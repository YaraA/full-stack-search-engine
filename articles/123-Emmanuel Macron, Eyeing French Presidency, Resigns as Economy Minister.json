He was stepping down to \u201cundertake a new step in my struggle,\u201d he said, and to \u201cbuild a project that will serve only the general interest.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Macron was once Mr. Hollande\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, he now represents a political threat to the president on his right. In polls, Mr. Macron routinely leads his erstwhile boss, whose support languishes in the midteens, and he often comes in second to the putative front-runner and former prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, who is the mayor of Bordeaux.\n\nThey are joined by an increasingly crowded field that also includes former president Nicolas Sarkozy, a flock of lesser government veterans, and several of Mr. Hollande\u2019s own former ministers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He has never held elected office.\n\nHis one major reform push, forced through a reluctant Parliament last year, did little more than open up intercity travel in France to commercial buses \u2014 a first \u2014 and allow large stores in some tourist areas to open on Sunday. Many are still shut, blocked by unions.\n\nHe has had a knack for keeping France\u2019s unions and left on low boil with positions that clearly favor free markets. Since creating his own idealistic political movement in the spring, Mr. Macron has attracted sizable crowds to his rallies, particularly of young people, and has openly considered running for president.\n\nBut the homogeneous demographic he has attracted \u2014 young and largely affluent \u2014 also point to Mr. Macron\u2019s potential weakness as a candidate. Many French analysts doubt that Mr. Macron, with his earnest, cultivated style often peppered with literary references, can reach a voting public destabilized by globalization and the Islamist threat.\n\nNevertheless, at a rally in central Paris last month, when Mr. Macron stopped just short of announcing his candidacy, he told hundreds of cheering supporters, \u201cnothing can stop this movement now.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThis movement, we will carry it together to 2017, and all the way to victory!\u201d"}
