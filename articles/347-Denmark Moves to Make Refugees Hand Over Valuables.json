Fears are growing that terrorists are entering Europe masquerading as refugees. Finland has called on asylum seekers to work without pay, and Sweden introduced identity checks last week for travelers arriving from Denmark, prompting Denmark to do the same along its border with Germany.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Denmark, as in countries like France and Sweden, a far-right populist party, the Danish People\u2019s Party, has been attracting voters by railing against immigration. Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s governing center-right party, which does not have a majority in Parliament, often needs the Danish People\u2019s Party\u2019s support to pass legislation.\n\nAnalysts said the recent moves by Denmark reflected a concerted effort to make the country less attractive for refugees. Among the new bill\u2019s provisions is a three-year waiting period before asylum seekers can apply to bring their families to Denmark, which human rights activists have criticized as unusually cruel.\n\nThe United Nations refugee agency has called the proposed legislation an affront to refugees\u2019 dignity and said it would send a worrying signal to other countries. In a statement this month, before the bill was amended, the commission said it \u201ccould fuel fear, xenophobia and similar restrictions that would reduce \u2014 rather than expand \u2014 the asylum space globally and put refugees in need at life-threatening risks.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Rohde left Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s center-right party, Venstre, in December in protest over the bill, saying that the party had lost its way and that it was in thrall to the far right.\n\n\u201cEven with the latest changes to the bill, the legislation still paints a bad image of Denmark in the international community, and I don\u2019t recognize myself or the Danish people in this bill,\u201d Mr. Rohde said. \u201cThe bill is less horrible than before, but still undignified.\u201d\n\nThe bill has had particular resonance in Denmark because the country has historically been known for its tolerance and generosity. During World War II, when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany, Danish citizens managed to save most of the country\u2019s 7,800 Jews by smuggling them to neighboring Sweden before they could be rounded up. Denmark also took in a large number of refugees during the Balkan wars of the 1990s.\n\nLast year, Denmark received 21,000 asylum seekers, according to the Danish Refugee Council. Sweden, in contrast, received about 163,000 asylum seekers, and Germany was expected to have received more than a million, the council said.\n\nJakob Nielsen, the editor of Politiken\u2019s online edition, said it was paradoxical that Denmark was trying to make the country less attractive for immigrants. \u201cDanes are known for being some of the happiest people on earth, with one of the most generous welfare states, and now the government is trying to worsen our image to give the message: Refugees, don\u2019t come here.\u201d", "summary": "Among the new bill\u2019s provisions is a three-year waiting period before asylum seekers can apply to bring their families to Denmark, which human rights activists have criticized as unusually cruel.
