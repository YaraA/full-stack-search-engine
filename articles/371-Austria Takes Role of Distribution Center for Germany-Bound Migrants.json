The conditions for its implementation are not there.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe accused Greece and Croatia, two members of the European Union, of violating European law: Greece by failing to prevent an influx of migrants, many of them from Turkey, and Croatia by flooding Hungary and Slovenia while failing to register them.\n\nUnder what are known as the Dublin Regulations, people who seek asylum in the European Union are required to register and apply in the member country where they first set foot.\n\nCroatia blamed Greece for the crisis. \u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable to have Greece emptying its refugee camps and sending people towards Croatia via Macedonia and Serbia,\u201d said the Croatian interior minister, Ranko Ostojic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Monday, Hungary\u2019s Parliament approved rules giving more powers to the army to enforce the country\u2019s borders with Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. Last week, Hungary adopted legislation making illegal border entry a crime, subject to imprisonment and expulsion.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban again emphasized that Hungary would not apologize for its strict measures because millions of migrants were \u201claying siege\u201d to Europe, endangering the Continent. \u201cThe migrants are not just banging on our door; they are breaking it down,\u201d Mr. Orban said.\n\nAs the United Nations prepared to convene in New York for its annual meeting, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement calling on European leaders to show leadership and compassion.\n\nIn the statement, a spokesman said that Mr. Ban \u201crecalls that many are fleeing persecution, conflict and human rights abuses and have endured arduous journeys in order to reach safety.\u201d\n\nAnthony Lake, the executive director of Unicef, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, told reporters at a briefing in New York that his agency had been working over the last few weeks \u201cto considerably ramp up what we\u2019re doing\u201d to serve migrant children traveling into European countries. But he also expressed worry about his agency\u2019s limited budget and fear of compromising Unicef\u2019s Syrian refugee work in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cOne of our concerns is precisely that we don\u2019t rob the Peter of the countries surrounding Syria to pay the Paul of Europe,\u201d Mr. Lake said.\n\nThe United States announced Monday that it would provide an additional $419 million in humanitarian aid for emergency health care, safe drinking water, food, shelter and other relief supplies to Syrians affected by the civil war there. The money will be distributed to organizations, including Unicef, aiding Syrians still in Syria and those in Lebanon, Turkey and elsewhere in the region. The White House said that would bring the total American commitment to the refugee crisis to $4.5 billion.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nIn Austria, many migrants said they were stunned at their treatment after journeys through nations to the south and east where officials were only too happy to simply push them north.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor people escaping a recent past of violence and persecution, landing in Austria has been one of the first opportunities to feel some measure of security.\n\n\u201cThis is unbelievable. I am so happy,\u201d said Zuhair, 23, a chemistry student from Homs, Syria, who did not want to give his last name because of fears for relatives he left behind. Less than a month ago, his hometown was \u201cpure hell,\u201d he said, as \u201cpeople around me were dying every single day.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When the buses carrying his group pulled into a parking lot on the Hungarian side, it was clear to him where he needed to go, he said.\n\nIn Hungary, the road to the border was barely lit. Police officers quietly waved the migrants through while a handful of aid workers offered apples and water.\n\nIn Austria, floodlights pierced the night. Dozens of volunteers were busy helping out, and a field kitchen served warm meals. Police officers were firm but friendly and, most of all, efficient in organizing the crowd.\n\n\u201cYour people is kind people; you know human rights,\u201d Mr. Mohamadzai said, referring to Europeans. \u201cIn Afghanistan there is no human rights.\u201d\n\nThe process is smooth. On Monday, a train carrying 1,800 migrants arrived late in the afternoon on the Hungarian side near Nickelsdorf. The people walking across the border brought the total of new arrivals to 5,000 since that morning, said Helmut Marban, a spokesman for the Burgenland police.\n\nFrom the border station at Hegyeshalom in Hungary, migrants crossed a grassy field on the frontier of Hungary and Austria. As they approached, Austrian police officers greeted them with a cheerful \u201cHallo, \u00d6sterreich,\u201d drawing looks of relief.\n\n\u201cAustria is very good, nice,\u201d said Mohamed Hoseini, 44, from Damascus, said shortly after he arrived. He said he had spent 14 hours in a Hungarian train with no food or water.\n\nVideo\n\nHe, like many on Monday, appeared to be ready to end his journey in this country. \u201cAustria is good, but I must ask about how long before I can bring my wife and baby,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe authorities did not have specific information of more trains arriving on the Hungarian side but were prepared for that event, Mr. Marban of the police said.\n\nThe main challenge was to provide shelter to the people on a windy night, with temperatures under 50 degrees.\n\n\u201cIt will be very cold outside and windy during the night,\u201d Mr. Marban said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try very hard to get accommodation for them here in Nickelsdorf and other provinces of Austria.\u201d\n\nOn Slovenia\u2019s northwestern border, a center into which people had been bused from the Croatian border the night before emptied out just after lunch. All 387 migrants, impatient with the Slovenian authorities\u2019 slow pace in moving them along, simply walked several hundred yards into Austria.\n\nIn the central Slovenian city of Celje, about 150 people, most of them Syrian refugees, left a center set up in a high school, bought tickets at the railway station and boarded a train to Vienna as the police looked on.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to spend another night in the camp,\u201d Merhin, 20, an engineering student from Aleppo, said. \u201cPolice allowed us to walk to the station and buy the ticket to Austria. We are extremely happy now.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear how long the people who do not want to seek asylum in Austria stay there before being moved on to Germany. But on Sunday night, in Salzburg, the operation to move them along proceeded quietly.\n\nShortly before a Deutsche Bahn commuter train departed around 9 p.m., the police escorted groups with children to the train.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDeparture boards declared there was no train service to Germany, and for that train, no destination was posted. But three individuals working at the station who did not provide their names said the train was headed to Germany.", "summary": "The foreign ministers of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia met in Prague on Monday, in advance of an emergency meeting of union leaders on Wednesday in Brussels.
