By contrast, Ms. Merkel has played up her status as a world leader and savored two unexpected clear victories for her party in other state elections, last week and in late March.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ms. Merkel marshaled Europe into a joint position on negotiating Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and warned the British against \u201cillusions\u201d that it would come easy.\n\nShe dined with the Saudi king in Riyadh, the capital, and the Russian president in Sochi, days after hosting a women\u2019s conference in Berlin with powerful figures as different as America\u2019s \u201cfirst daughter,\u201d Ivanka Trump, and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIn a turbulent world, Ms. Merkel\u2019s status as an undramatic but effective problem solver seems to have won over voters at home, despite what her critics say is a lack of a clear domestic agenda.\n\nHer Christian Democrats won elections in Germany\u2019s northernmost state on May 7, and one poll conducted afterward for the public broadcaster ARD found that a staggering 87 percent of conservative voters endorsed the view that \u201cAngela Merkel ensures that we are doing fine in an unsettled world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nForty-six percent said she was the \u201cmost important reason\u201d to vote conservative, while 28 percent said they would not vote for the party without her.\n\nPublicly, Ms. Merkel almost never acknowledges such numbers. In private, she and her team track poll data, as any successful politician must. After appearing reluctant last winter to run again for office, she has clearly been buoyed by recent events.\n\nBefore a crowd of about 550 conservative movers and shakers in this wealthy state capital on Thursday, Ms. Merkel was almost playful with her interviewer, Michael Br\u00f6cker, the editor of the Rheinische Post newspaper.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen he asked, for instance, if she ever looked herself up online, Ms. Merkel joked, \u201cI only look at my cellphone once in a while so I can remember my own phone number.\u201d\n\nBut she was serious when asked about polls that showed the race tightening in North Rhine-Westphalia, where Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives have governed for only five of the past 50 years.\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia \u201cis no easy terrain\u201d for us, she said, while proceeding to pummel the center-left with charges of letting infrastructure deteriorate, tinkering with education and being lax on security.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The mass assaults on women in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2015 and the state authorities\u2019 failure to detain a Tunisian terrorist who plowed a truck into a Berlin Christmas market last year, killing 12, have prompted fierce criticism of the current coalition government of Social Democrats and Greens.\n\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany, which held a fractious congress in the state in late April, is predicted to clear the 5 percent barrier for entering the state legislature but to fall short of the double digits it confidently forecast last winter.\n\nThe party\u2019s support, for now, has been dented by outrage over a party leader\u2019s criticism of the monument in Berlin to Jews killed in the Holocaust.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt has been similarly undercut by Ms. Merkel\u2019s moves to reduce the refugee influx and to assuage anti-Islam activists by supporting a ban on the full veil for Muslim women. The distaste for populism as practiced by President Trump in the United States has also reduced its attraction here.\n\nInitially, Mr. Schulz had siphoned support from the far right. He hails from the far west of North Rhine-Westphalia, which encompasses the gritty Ruhr industrial heartland, several of Germany\u2019s most troubled and most prosperous cities, and bucolic Rhine River country.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo listen to voices from Germany\u2019s rust belt is to hear strong echoes of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in the United States.\n\nGuido Reil, a 26-year veteran of the Social Democrats and a coal miner, quit the party in disgust last year and joined Alternative for Germany.\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, I have been forced to watch the decline of my home, the Ruhr,\u201d he said while campaigning for the state legislature. \u201cWe are always speaking so grandly of changing the structure \u2014 coal and steel have vanished, and in their place comes something else. But that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nSusanne Neumann and Christel Wellmann, both 58, are cleaners in the Ruhr area who gained national prominence after Ms. Neumann confronted leading Social Democrats at a forum last year.\n\nThey have kept the faith, just, but Ms. Wellmann suggested that Mr. Schulz and other politicians \u201cshould do our jobs \u2014 cleaning, care for the elderly \u2014 for just one day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen perhaps they would act a little more \u2014 not just talk,\u201d Ms. Wellmann said.\n\nMs. Neumann said, \u201cThe gulf between rich and poor is getting bigger and bigger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schulz has made much of righting inequality, and his program, due only in June, may yet see him surge anew in the long months until the fall elections, scheduled for Sept. 24.\n\nBut after being chosen to lead his party\u2019s campaign with an unheard-of 100 percent of votes cast at a party congress in mid-March, Mr. Schulz and the Social Democrats have stumbled.\n\nMr. Schulz, initially welcomed as a fresh face in Germany\u2019s often dull politics, had spent most of his career in European structures in Brussels. So far, he has failed to make a lasting impact, suffering because he does not hold government office, which would guarantee him a certain amount of attention."}
