But with that path growing increasingly dangerous, a shorter boat ride from Turkey, to an overland route from Greece to Macedonia to Serbia to southern Hungary started attracting more people this summer.\n\nHungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, responded by beginning the construction of a razor-wire fence along the country\u2019s entire 108-mile border with Serbia.\n\nMr. Orban has also promised a fresh crackdown against those crossing the border when new laws take effect in Hungary on Tuesday, imposing harsh prison penalties for entering the country illegally and allowing the building of \u201ctransit centers\u201d right at the border where migrants could be held while their cases are being considered.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn announcing Germany\u2019s new border restrictions, Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re also called for the creation of what he called \u201cwaiting zones\u201d along the union\u2019s external borders where migrants could be registered and wait until they are granted refugee status and assigned to a country.\n\nHungary\u2019s government, which has taken a particularly hard line in the crisis, reacted warmly to Germany\u2019s announcement on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHungary understands Germany\u2019s decision, and Hungary is standing by Germany,\u201d Peter Szijjarto, the country\u2019s foreign minister, said at a news conference.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Advocates for refugees say that those determined to reach Europe will only find other paths.\n\nPhoto\n\nJust how dangerous that sea crossing can be was evident again Sunday when the Greek Coast Guard recovered the bodies of 34 migrants, including 15 children, after their boat capsized in the Aegean Sea. An additional 68 were rescued, and 30 others managed to swim to the nearby island of Farmakonisi.\n\nThe land portion of the journey offers dangers, too. The Austrian authorities said they had saved 42 people on Sunday from a refrigerated truck near the German border, and arrested two smugglers. Just last month, 71 people were found dead in the back of such a truck near the Austrian-Hungarian border.\n\nGermany has said it expects 800,000 migrants by year\u2019s end, but has indicated up to now that it can handle the newcomers, and even welcomed their addition to its aging work force.\n\nBut the numbers arriving have continued to grow, and Germany\u2019s humanitarian network is wobbling under the strain.\n\nOn Saturday, around 12,000 migrants arrived in Munich, with 4,000 more by Sunday afternoon. More beds are needed, Munich officials said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd more migrants are on the way. Before Germany closed off rail traffic from Austria, Austrian officials said 500 migrants were arriving every hour at the main border crossing between Hungary and Austria, with 7,000 crossing that day before 3 p.m.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nThe city of Salzburg sent out a post on Twitter asking residents to bring blankets and camping pads to the railway station to help accommodate several hundred people spending the night there and in a nearby parking garage.\n\nOn the Serbian border, the Hungarian authorities said that 4,330 migrants were detained Saturday for crossing illegally, an increase of 700 over the previous one-day record.\n\nAnd many thousands more are waiting to cross behind them, or are making their slow way to the border.\n\n\u201cThe influx is simply not stopping right now,\u201d said Lt. Col. Helmut Marban, a police spokesman in Austria\u2019s easternmost state. \u201cWe really have our plates full.\u201d\n\nGuntram B. Wolff, director of Breugel, a Brussels research group, said Germany\u2019s decision to impose controls seemed to be \u201can interim thing,\u201d rather than a sign that the European Union, panicked by a disorderly influx of migrants, was retreating from the principle of open borders.\n\n\u201cIt is just a measure to slow down the flow and to handle things in a more orderly manner,\u201d he said.\n\nBut if some Europe-wide agreement is not reached to deal with the crisis, Mr. Wolff said, the so-called Schengen system that allows passport-free travel across 26 countries is in danger of collapsing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere has to be a European solution, and if there is not one, then Schengen will come under pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the moment, Schengen is still there.\u201d\n\nAbdelkahar Sherzad, a 28-year-old from Afghanistan, heard about Germany\u2019s new restrictions only after waiting four days for a train out of Budapest\u2019s Keleti station.\n\n\u201cI would really like to go to Germany,\u201d Mr. Sherzad said. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t let me go, I will consider other options, like staying in Austria or trying to go to another country. I won\u2019t stop.\u201d", "summary": "When word of the new restrictions made the rounds at the main station in Salzburg, Austria, the last major stop on the rail journey to Germany, hundreds of migrants were taken off the blocked trains and to a garage nearby, the German Press Agency said.
