{"title": "E.U. Woos Turkey for Refugee Help, Ignoring Rights Crackdown", "authors": ["Tim Arango", "Ceylan Yeginsu"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/world/europe/turkey-european-union-refugees.html", "body": "\u201cMore rights and freedoms for people in Turkey has been the reason why I supported accession,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament. But nowadays, she said, \u201cwe see the trading away of principles in the mere hope of solutions to Europe\u2019s own challenges in dealing with asylum seekers and migrants.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the media crackdown, critics have been concerned by the renewed fighting in Turkey\u2019s southeast between the army and Kurdish insurgents. They say Europe should do more to push the two sides to return to peace talks.\n\nSelahattin Demirtas, the top Kurdish political leader, whose party for the first time won representation in Parliament in elections last year, said the refugee crisis had led Europe to be largely silent on the renewed war in the southeast. He criticized Europe for bowing to Turkey\u2019s demands and not taking a tougher line with Ankara on its domestic troubles.\n\n\u201cBlackmailing European countries in turn for the refugee crisis, this is something that the European Union should not close their eyes to,\u201d Mr. Demirtas told reporters on Monday. \u201cThe European Union should see this as blackmailing, and this is not in line with European values.\u201d\n\nIn previous years, the membership talks between Turkey and the European Union led to more democracy within Turkey, analysts say. To put itself more in line with European values, Turkey has abolished the death penalty, legalized education and news broadcasts in the Kurdish language, granted more rights to non-Muslim minorities and curbed the influence of the military over politics. Now that is shifting.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cE.U.-Turkey relations today are merely transactional,\u201d said Mustafa Akyol, a Turkish columnist who sometimes contributes to The New York Times. \u201cWe can give you this, you can give us that. You take back some refugees, we give you free visas. It is not about Turkey becoming an E.U.-style liberal democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s pre-eminent political figure since 2003, once embraced democratic reforms in the hopes of obtaining European Union membership. But in recent years, as those hopes faded, the early gains were reversed. There was a tough crackdown on government protesters in the summer of 2013. There was a corruption investigation that prompted the government to purge the judiciary and the police of perceived enemies. And there has been the erosion of press freedoms.\n\nNow, rather than being the leader of a glittering Islamic democracy, Mr. Erdogan, who remains extremely popular among his religiously conservative base, is often compared to Vladimir V. Putin, the leader of Russia \u2014 an authoritarian leader with little regard for freedom of expression.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Like Zaman, which was seized last week, Cihan is linked to the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, a rival of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s who lives in exile.\n\nAnd as the talks were progressing in Brussels on Monday, Mr. Erdogan, in a speech in Ankara, denounced the Europeans for failing to deliver on their pledge of more than $3 billion in aid for refugees.\n\n\u201cThey promised to give us three billion euros, and four months have passed since then,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister is in Brussels right now. I hope he returns with that money, the three billion euros.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nActivists, press freedom advocates and Turkish liberals who once counted on the prospect of European Union membership to bring about more democratic reforms have reacted with despair to Europe\u2019s muted criticism of what they see as Turkey\u2019s increasingly antidemocratic behavior.\n\n\u201cIs the E.U. determined to let itself be humiliated?\u201d Christophe Deloire, the secretary general of the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, asked in a statement on Monday. He noted that Turkey\u2019s seizure of the daily newspaper Zaman had come last week as Mr. Tusk was on a visit to Ankara.\n\nSvante Cornell, a Turkey analyst and director of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, a research organization, said the various crackdowns on the news media \u201cillustrate fully the charade that E.U.-Turkey relations have become.\"\n\n\u201cThe timing of Turkey\u2019s move against Zaman was ostentatious,\u201d he said, \u201csuggesting Erdogan\u2019s government is not even trying to pretend to live up to European norms and values.\u201d\n\nThis week Zaman, now overseen by court-appointed trustees, quickly shifted from a steadfast critic of the government to a voice of support, a transformation neatly illustrated by Tuesday\u2019s front-page headlines about the summit meeting in Brussels.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA green light from the E.U. for Turkey\u2019s demands,\u201d one read, while another celebrated that \u201cthe path to visa-free travel in Europe opens.\u201d", "summary": "Selahattin Demirtas, the top Kurdish political leader, whose party for the first time won representation in Parliament in elections last year, said the refugee crisis had led Europe to be largely silent on the renewed war in the southeast.
