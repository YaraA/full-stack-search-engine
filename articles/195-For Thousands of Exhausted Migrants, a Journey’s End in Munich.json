There, he said, they were laid upon by smugglers and saw people so exhausted that they collapsed.\n\n\u201cThat was a bad journey,\u201d he said.\n\nSome 2,100 migrants had poured into Munich\u2019s main station by Tuesday night, said Carsten Neubert, a police spokesman. That was on top of 1,750 who arrived there or in the surrounding region on Monday, said Matthias Knott, a spokesman for the federal police. Many spread blankets on the stone-tiled floor and stretched out, their heads propped on their backpacks, in a wing of the station cordoned off to provide them with a place to rest.\n\nFor many of the migrants, Germany was their dream destination, a safe haven and an opportunity to begin new lives after enduring war and strife in the Middle East or Northern Africa. Drawn by its strong economy and the prospect of securing jobs, nearly a quarter-million people have already applied for asylum in Germany in the first six months of 2015. Government officials have said they expect a total of 800,000 new arrivals by year\u2019s end.\n\nBut the final phase of the trek for those who arrived Monday and Tuesday was particularly harrowing, as completion of a new barbed-wire fence on the Hungary-Serbia border and discord over immigration policy slowed their passage through Hungary, en route to Austria and then Germany.\n\nAt the train station in Budapest on Monday, many of the travelers were met by confusion, long lines and a dearth of police officers and other personnel to help them navigate the station and the next leg of their journeys.\n\nSome of the migrants were again stopped at the train station near the Hungary-Austria border, the Vienna station or close to Austria\u2019s border with Germany.\n\nWhile European Union rules call for arriving migrants to be registered in the country where they first enter the bloc, many were let through without any documentation \u2014 and then were allowed to continue their trip again when they reached Vienna, even if they chose not to register there, as well. The German authorities said they would register every migrant and, when applicable, initiate an application for asylum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose who landed in Germany on Tuesday morning narrowly avoided being trapped in Budapest, where the authorities on Tuesday suddenly stopped allowing unregistered migrants onto trains, essentially shutting down the station \u2014 and the route west \u2014 to most of them.\n\nBut in Munich, the scene was markedly different. Many of the new arrivals seemed overwhelmed by the abundance of volunteers and food, water, clothing, toys and other gifts that were bestowed on them as they poured off trains through the day and into the evening.\n\nBavaria, in Germany\u2019s southeastern corner, has been the front line for many of the new arrivals, and emergency plans have already been in place for months.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first of these centers opened Tuesday, and three more were expected to help take the strain off the system so the migrants fleeing war and political persecution could be processed more swiftly.\n\nMs. Schantz said her team had worked through the night, after watching reports late Monday that hundreds of people were packing trains bound for Vienna and on to Munich. They began putting emergency plans into action, as updates of the migrants\u2019 progress toward Austria and north to Germany came in from the police tracking their movement from border to border.\n\nAs the hundreds swelled to more than a thousand early Tuesday, buses were organized to ferry asylum seekers from Munich\u2019s city center, which was sweltering under nearly 90-degree temperatures and bright sunshine. Long lines of people waited patiently behind red-and-white ribbons of police tape on streets closed to traffic for the buses that would take them to other parts of Bavaria and the neighboring state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n\u201cWe want to swiftly get them to a shelter where they can rest and find a bit of peace,\u201d Ms. Schantz said.\n\nThe first priorities were addressing hunger, thirst and medical needs, said Mr. Neubert, the police spokesman.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the station, boxes piled high with bread, fruit and stacks of drinks were set up on the long wooden tables and benches typical of the city\u2019s many beer gardens. Organizers said they had fed some 800 people the previous night and called early Tuesday for more donations.\n\nBy early afternoon, the Munich police put out notices over social media asking people to slow down, saying they were \u201coverwhelmed\u201d with goods and had enough to meet everyone\u2019s needs.\n\nOne of the volunteers was Ashley Fliess, 39, who stood outside Tuesday night handing out umbrellas after it began to rain. She said she, like many of the other volunteers, had just shown up after realizing that the trains from Budapest and Vienna would be arriving.\n\n\u201cIt was just logic,\u201d she said. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Well, then they will be in Munich very soon.\u2019\u201d She had been there for about 24 hours, with one hour\u2019s sleep, she said.\n\nRen\u00e9 Hinkfoth, 34, of Munich, said he was on vacation. He showed up in the morning and was still there Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cDo you need something warm?\u201d he asked, holding out a plate of rice to a woman as she entered the makeshift migrant center with two children. It was not the first food they had been offered in the Munich station; almost immediately after passing the handmade \u201cWelcome in Germany\u201d signs, they had accepted a pretzel from a large crate, and stuffed it into an increasingly full shopping bag.\n\n\u201cNow is not the moment to think about so many refugees, the consequences,\u201d Mr. Hinkfoth said, commenting on the politics of the situation as he stood next to piles of bananas. \u201cThere are so many refugees. They need what a human needs.\u201d", "summary": "But the final phase of the trek for those who arrived Monday and Tuesday was particularly harrowing, as completion of a new barbed-wire fence on the Hungary-Serbia border and discord over immigration policy slowed their passage through Hungary, en route to Austria and then Germany.
