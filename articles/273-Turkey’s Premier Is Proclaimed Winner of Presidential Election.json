The direction of the nation is much brighter than yesterday.\u201d\n\nFireworks were set off at the end of his address, in which he advocated reconciliation, a common theme in his previous victory speeches. \u201cI want us to build a new future with an understanding of societal reconciliation, while considering our differences as our richnesses and bringing forward our common values,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said.\n\nTurnout was about 74 percent, CNN Turk reported, relatively low for Turkey, presumably because many had assumed Mr. Erdogan would win.\n\nEven though the election felt like a coronation, a great deal is at stake for the Turkish political system. Arguing that he has a popular mandate to do so, Mr. Erdogan is expected to maximize the powers of the presidency \u2014 a post that is less powerful than that of prime minister, limited in part by the Constitution and in part by tradition.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo lead from the presidency he would, in practice, need to retain the reins of the Islamist A.K.P., despite being required by law to step down as its official head. By doing so, analysts say, Mr. Erdogan could then choose a malleable figure to be prime minister. He is also expected to push for legislation that would establish a presidential system, much like in the United States, a change that would upend the nature of Turkish politics.\n\nWhile the office is often described as ceremonial, Turkey\u2019s president has the ability to veto legislation, appoint judges and call national security meetings. And analysts say Mr. Erdogan is likely to exercise powers that former presidents chose not to use, such as calling cabinet meetings.\n\nUnder Mr. Erdogan\u2019s watch, Turkey\u2019s military has been sidelined from its traditional role in politics through a series of controversial trials. The country has also become an economic power, and Mr. Erdogan\u2019s constituency of religious conservatives benefited greatly through higher incomes and better public services.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A recent survey by the Pew Research Center showed a nearly equal divide between those who support Mr. Erdogan and those who do not. Many liberals, nationalists and urban Turks believe Mr. Erdogan has become too authoritarian, and they object to what they see as the mingling of religion and politics under his leadership.\n\n\u201cHe is power happy and arrogant, serving only half of the population that supports him, while the other half he deems irrelevant,\u201d said Eren Kurban, 32, who voted in the Besiktas neighborhood.\n\nMr. Erdogan is to be inaugurated as president on Aug. 28, replacing his longtime partner in Turkish Islamist politics, Abdullah Gul. Many speculate that it will ultimately be Mr. Gul who becomes prime minister after national elections next year.\n\nPast presidents who previously served as prime minister, like Turgut Ozal and Suleyman Demirel, underestimated the autonomy and resilience of their parties and became disgruntled as they lost control of governance. If Mr. Erdogan is able to orchestrate the appointment of a compliant interim prime minister, he is expected to influence decisions and continue to run the government until he fulfills his long-term ambition of replacing the parliamentary system with a presidential one.\n\nHaving served three terms as prime minister, Mr. Erdogan is prevented from seeking a fourth by the internal rules of his party.\n\n\u201cMembers of the A.K.P. fear and respect Erdogan at the same time,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIt won\u2019t be hard for him to pull rank over the party, even when he resigns from the A.K.P.\u201d", "summary": "While the office is often described as ceremonial, Turkey\u2019s president has the ability to veto legislation, appoint judges and call national security meetings.\u201cThis country needs a strong, fierce president who can secure the economy and fight foreign threats and terrorists,\u201d Habiye Dorsay, 43, said after voting in the Uskudar district.Past presidents who previously served as prime minister, like Turgut Ozal and Suleyman Demirel, underestimated the autonomy and resilience of their parties and became disgruntled as they lost control of governance.If Mr. Erdogan is able to orchestrate the appointment of a compliant interim prime minister, he is expected to influence decisions and continue to run the government until he fulfills his long-term ambition of replacing the parliamentary system with a presidential one.fear and respect Erdogan at the same time,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy."}
