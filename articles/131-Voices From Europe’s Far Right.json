We received hundreds of responses from voters, most of whom cited concern about immigration and a desire to challenge the European Union in explaining their views.\n\nSome took issue with being identified as far-right supporters, saying they were simply challenging a mainstream that did not reflect their beliefs or experiences. And many of the readers, who were predominantly male, would not give their names, saying they feared stigmatization.\n\nThese responses have been edited for length and clarity. And because many of the issues raised are highly contentious across Europe, we have provided context with each submission.\n\nMikael Jakobsen, 24, law student, Aarhus, Denmark\n\nParty: Danish People\u2019s Party\n\nSymbolic politics of \u201chelping\u201d those who need help by inviting them in regardless of circumstances and economy don\u2019t help. Our economy doesn\u2019t increase along with the never-ending supply of immigrants. To help, you figure out the cause of the problem and fix it. It\u2019s like buying buckets for a leaky roof instead of just fixing the roof itself.\n\n\u2022 Denmark, along with other Nordic countries, has moved to slash benefits for migrants as arrivals increased last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Parliament, where the anti-immigration Danish People\u2019s Party is the second-largest force, approved a law requiring new refugees to hand over valuables to help pay for lodging them.\n\nOscar Lind, 43, economist, Stockholm\n\nParty: Sweden Democrats\n\nThree things make me consider voting for the Sweden Democrats, even if I find the party\u2019s historical links to white supremacy repugnant and don\u2019t agree with their anti-E.U. and anti-NATO membership stances: mass immigration and open borders, identity politics, and \u201cestablishment\u201d propaganda for the previous two. Sweden has had massive immigration over the past couple of decades. Instead of acknowledging the problems related to mass immigration, the mainstream parties and mainstream media have for decades either ignored them, blamed them on Swedish/Swedes\u2019 racism, blamed them on lack of social services or claimed that while there may be initial cost with immigration, it\u2019s profitable long term. Why would a male, ethnic Swedish worker want to vote for political parties which see \u201cwhite men\u201d as oppressors and regularly denigrate their ethnicity and culture?\n\n\u2022 Immigration in Sweden has been rising at a steady pace in the past three decades. Last year, almost 10 times as many people were granted residency as in 1980. While crime has increased in recent decades, the number of reported offenses did not grow proportionally with the number of immigrants.", "summary": "We received hundreds of responses from voters, most of whom cited concern about immigration and a desire to challenge the European Union in explaining their views. \u2022 Parliament, where the anti-immigration Danish People\u2019s Party is the second-largest force, approved a law requiring new refugees to hand over valuables to help pay for lodging them.
