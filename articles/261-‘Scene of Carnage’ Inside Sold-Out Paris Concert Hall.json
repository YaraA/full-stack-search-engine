The 150-year-old music hall was sold out for the show by the American group Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nSuddenly, four men brandishing AK-47 assault rifles entered the hall. There were shouts of \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d just before the gunmen opened fire, and for about 20 minutes there was carnage.\n\nWitnesses said the attackers also threw grenades into the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhen they started shooting, we just saw flashes,\u201d a witness named Gwen told French BFM-TV. \u201cPeople got down on the ground right away. It was all dark.\u201d\n\nLatest Updates\n\nIn the scramble to survive, people climbed into the upper boxes of the hall, or cowered under seats. The musicians quickly fled the stage.\n\n\u201cIt was a scene of carnage,\u201d Julien Pearce, a radio reporter who was inside the Bataclan, told Europe 1 radio.\n\nThe music hall can seat up to 1,500 people, but it was unclear how many were inside when the attack began. Some of the spectators managed to escape out back exits, but for minutes the gunmen shot unimpeded.\n\nVideo\n\nBenjamin Cazenoves posted an update on Facebook from inside the theater: \u201cAlive. Just some cuts. Carnage. Bodies everywhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Pearce told CNN that he saw two of the men enter and begin to fire randomly. He said the gunmen wore black and said nothing. They simply fired indiscriminately into the crowd. Mr. Pearce said that when he walked out into the street, he saw 25 bodies on the ground.\n\n\u201cIt lasted for 10 minutes, 10 minutes, 10 horrific minutes when everybody was on the floor covering their heads and we heard so many gunshots, and the terrorists were very calm, very determined, and they reloaded three or four times their weapons,\u201d Mr. Pearce said.\n\nAt around 10 p.m. the gunmen began rounding up survivors, holding them as hostages as dozens of police officers massed outside. For more than two hours a tense standoff prevailed, with more and more police arriving at the scene, enlarging the tense perimeter around the music hall in the city\u2019s 11th Arrondissement.\n\n\u201cI saw these two crazy guys arrive \u2014 they started firing on everybody,\u201d a witness named Yasmine told BFM television. She heard one of the men shout, \u201c \u2018What you are doing in Syria, you are going to pay for it now.\u2019 \u201d\n\nYasmine began to cry as she recounted what she had seen. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many dead around me.\u201d She was shot in the foot.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

There were a few quick rounds of gunfire, several explosions, and then it was over.\n\nThree of the attackers blew themselves up, according to French television, and one was shot dead by the police.\n\nVideo\n\nAfter the assault, television images showed hostages streaming out of the hall, some with their hands on their heads. Elsewhere, away from the venue, plastic sheeting covered bodies of some of the victims. The streets were thick with police and fire vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe police are uncovering a scene of horror and apocalypse inside this music hall,\u201d a journalist said on French television.\n\nThe authorities said more than 100 were dead. Buses streamed from the scene bearing survivors, some wrapped in towels, to be taken to Police Headquarters in the center of the city and interviewed.\n\nNearby, the public prosecutor for Paris, Fran\u00e7ois Molins, told reporters \u2014 speaking of all the attacks on Friday \u2014 that \u201cthere is a risk that the death toll might reach or even exceed 120 dead.\u201d\n\nSirens continued to blare throughout the night, but the streets were otherwise deserted.", "summary": "Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
