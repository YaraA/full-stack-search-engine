France, which had been on the sidelines of negotiations over Syria, has taken the lead in trying to coordinate the disparate coalitions against the Islamic State.\n\nAt home, aggressive police tactics eliminated the presumed architect of the Nov. 13 attacks, even though another key suspect is still on the lam. France has prodded Europe to improve border security and intelligence sharing.\n\nBut none of this necessarily adds up to a winning strategy. Most experts agree that without reliable support from local ground forces, the bombing campaign in Syria and Iraq is unlikely to defeat the Islamic State. After the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey, a global alliance seems more unlikely than ever.\n\nMost important, neither the bombing, nor the diplomacy, nor the police raids are likely to sway some unemployed French youths \u2014 many of them second-generation immigrants \u2014 who seem to have turned to jihad as an outlet for their resentment and alienation.\n\n\u201cThe essential problem for France is thus not the \u2018caliphate\u2019 in the Syrian desert which will evaporate sooner or later like an old mirage that has turned into a nightmare,\u201d wrote Olivier Roy, a professor of political Islam, in the French newspaper Le Monde recently. \u201cThe problem is the revolt of these young people.\u201d\n\nThis time, however, the Islamic State may have gone too far, argues Gilles Kepel, a professor at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, who is also an expert on Islam in France.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf one goal of jihadist terrorism is to turn local societies against their Muslim citizens, thus mobilizing more young Muslims to join the cause and foment a civil war, then the Nov. 13 attacks may have backfired, Mr. Kepel said in the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This was in contrast to reactions last January to the attacks on Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish grocery store, when some young people in the banlieues refused to join in national displays of solidarity.\n\nIf that makes the Nov. 13 attacks a strategic mistake on the part of the enemy, that would be welcome news for France\u2019s struggling \u201cwar.\u201d", "summary": "Most experts agree that without reliable support from local ground forces, the bombing campaign in Syria and Iraq is unlikely to defeat the Islamic State.
