Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, for example, has been widely accused of stoking anti-immigrant passions by proposing a wall to keep out what he described as rapacious Mexicans, and a moratorium on travel to the United States by all Muslims from abroad because they might include terrorists.\n\nMr. Rumbaut said that the perception of immigrant illegality has thrived regardless of evidence that refutes it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018zombie idea\u2019 \u2014 one that keeps coming back from the dead,\u201d he said.\n\nA 2007 study by Mr. Rumbaut and Mr. Ewing also showed most immigrants are law-abiding, as did a study published around the same time by Robert J. Sampson, a Harvard sociologist, which showed in an inverse relationship between immigration and crime, a pattern that Mr. Sampson said \u201cupends popular stereotypes.\u201d\n\nBoth studies came out as the United States was embroiled in an angry, politically charged debate about immigration reform, further aggravated by the execution-style killings of three teenagers in Newark that law enforcement officials attributed to illegal immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen, as now in parts of Europe, many American politicians railed against illegal immigrants. Among the best-remembered episodes was a 2007 visit to Newark by Representative Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Republican presidential contender and ardent immigration opponent, who paradoxically, was the grandchild of Italian immigrants.\n\nMr. Tancredo was known for having declared that immigration had created \u201clinguistic ghettos where millions of immigrants speak no English while replicating living standards such as those found in Haiti.\u201d\n\nMr. Tancredo\u2019s critics are fond of pointing out the echoes expressed in 1891 by Representative Henry Cabot Lodge, a Massachusetts Republican, during a wave of arrivals from Russia, Poland and Italy \u2014 including Mr. Tancredo\u2019s grandparents."}
