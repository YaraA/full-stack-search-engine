{"title": "In Athens, Greeks Wonder Whether Tsipras Folded or Restored Dignity", "authors": ["Suzanne Daley", "Anemona Hartocollis"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/world/europe/in-athens-greeks-muse-on-tsiprass-abrupt-reversal.html", "body": "\u201cWe have to vote yes,\u201d said Harry Theoharis, a member of the new To Potami centrist party. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad deal, but it\u2019s this deal or catastrophe.\u201d\n\nEvangelos Venizelos, the former leader of Greece\u2019s Socialist Party, even asked Mr. Tsipras\u2019s finance minister whether he would, in effect, apologize for past statements suggesting that the previous government had been incompetent.\n\nEarly in the day, the government released a photograph of Mr. Tsipras smiling and receiving a standing ovation after briefing members of his Syriza Party on the state of his negotiations with European officials. But later, on the chamber floor, one Syriza member, Rachel Makri, took the microphone to criticize the new deal and announce that she would not vote for it.\n\n\u201cUnder no circumstances will I approve proposals that align with the lenders by 80 percent,\u201d she said. Ms. Makri added that the proposals were what 60 percent of voters on Sunday had rejected. The mandate from the referendum, she said, would not allow reductions in pensions, one of the concessions made by Mr. Tsipras.\n\nEven as they fumed, some unhappy Syriza members ended up voting for the deal.\n\nThe Tsipras proposal, which the Greek government submitted under a tight deadline before a weekend of meetings that could determine whether Greece remains in the euro currency union, is part of an effort to win approval of a new three-year bailout loan of 53.5 billion euros, or about $59 billion.\n\nMany Greeks said that despite Mr. Tsipras\u2019s apparent reversal, his fight with European leaders had given Greece back a measure of dignity and forced its creditors to admit in public that debt relief was necessary for the country to prosper.\n\nThat more hardship was on the way was not really a surprise, even though the country had voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to reject a deal with almost precisely the terms their government now appeared to be agreeing to.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Tears sprang to his eyes as he described how he had been forced to close his snack bar four years ago because of debts and open this smaller business, which was not doing well, either.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet he did not for a second regret his \u201cno\u201d vote on Sunday, and he guessed Mr. Tsipras would get 60 percent of the vote if a new election were held now.\n\n\u201cWe will have new measures, which is not good,\u201d he said. But he said he was convinced that Mr. Tsipras, by putting the earlier deal to a referendum, had forced the Europeans\u2019 hand and made leaders like Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, soften their stances.\n\n\u201cBefore, it was Juncker against the government,\u201d Mr. Alexis said. \u201cNow the people have spoken, and it\u2019s completely different.\u201d\n\nSome said that the biggest challenge now for the Greek people would be to remain patient and let the political and economic situation play out.\n\nTwo friends, enjoying a beer together at a sidewalk cafe in central Athens after a moving job at the Cypriot Embassy, said that they had both voted \u201cno\u201d in the referendum and thought the will of the Greek people had been heard, but that they were prepared to live with the new cutbacks Mr. Tsipras had proposed.\n\n\u201cI think the measures will be a little more harsh,\u201d said one of them, Ivan Ivanov, a Bulgarian immigrant who said he had been in Greece for decades. \u201cBut Germany can\u2019t write off 60 percent of the people.\u201d\n\nHe said that the seeds of Greece\u2019s problems had been planted long before Mr. Tsipras was elected, and that it would be unfair to blame him for the state of affairs, or for the intransigence of some European leaders. \u201cHe\u2019s been in government for six months,\u201d Mr. Ivanov said. \u201cTsipras is not to blame.\u201d\n\nIn any case, he said, the European loans have not made much difference in the lives of ordinary people. \u201cThe money wasn\u2019t going to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt went to the big shots and the banks.\u201d\n\nHis friend, Bilbil Tzepa, 41, said he believed that the banks, which have been closed since the beginning of last week, would open on Tuesday. Mr. Ivanov said he had heard they would not open until July 20.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSunday is the deadline,\u201d Mr. Tzepa persisted. \u201cThat\u2019s when they\u2019ll decide.\u201d\n\nEither way, they said, they would not be angry. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in anger?\u201d Mr. Tzepa asked. \u201cWe know what we want, and we know that he is trying to get it: to lighten the debt. There\u2019s no need for uprising. We have patience.\u201d", "summary": "Evangelos Venizelos, the former leader of Greece\u2019s Socialist Party, even asked Mr. Tsipras\u2019s finance minister whether he would, in effect, apologize for past statements suggesting that the previous government had been incompetent.
