This Time in France.", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/europe/francois-fillon-france-election.html", "body": "That strategy has not only vaulted Mr. Fillon to the front of the pack, surprising the French news media, pundits and politicians. It has also has shifted the playing field for French conservatives far to the right, snug alongside the far-right National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, who may be his strongest challenger next year.\n\nThe two are now competing for some of the same voters, but the xenophobic, anti-immigrant National Front is not regarded as respectable by many middle-class French people, particularly Catholics.\n\nMr. Fillon, on the other hand, has positioned himself as a staunch defender of French values, vowing to restore authority, honor the Roman Catholic Church and exert \u201cstrict administrative control\u201d over Islam.\n\nSuch appeals were met with fervent cheers during his campaign rally here by supporters who agreed that French identity and French values were under threat from both Islam and the secular left.\n\nIf those themes sound familiar to the ones that already shaped pivotal votes in Britain and the United States this year, it is because they are. And Mr. Fillon, an unsmiling political veteran, has used them to remarkable effect in France to change his political fortunes.\n\nFew analysts give France\u2019s Socialists and their unpopular president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a strong chance in the spring. But Mr. Fillon, with his dark-eyed frown, suggests a return to authority, and the rally crowd of about 5,000 here loved it.\n\n\u201cHe really respects French values, and that is very, very important to us,\u201d said Vincent Robert, a man in late middle-age who said he was a retired artisan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is uprightness and frankness,\u201d Mr. Robert said. \u201cAnd incredible enthusiasm for him in the middle class.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHis friend Bruno Perrin, a retired management consultant, was equally in thrall. \u201cIt\u2019s his defense of values \u2014 Christianity, the family, our traditions \u2014 that is what we like,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Fillon\u2019s supporters say he is now the candidate best placed to bar Ms. Le Pen\u2019s path to victory.\n\nAnalysts, however, warn that Mr. Fillon\u2019s proposed austerity cure for France\u2019s economic stagnation \u2014 cutting 500,000 Civil Service positions and 100 billion euros (about $105 billion) in spending \u2014 could be just the thing to push frightened voters into the arms of the National Front leader.\n\nStill, parishioners at Paris\u2019s solidly bourgeois Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 church, a hulking 19th-century neo-Renaissance monument that looms over a busy square, were in no doubt that Mr. Fillon was the one.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a sense of honesty and the family,\u201d said one churchgoer, C\u00e9cile Despointes, after midday Mass this week. \u201cA man of courage and perseverance.\u201d\n\nIt is a surprising turnabout for Mr. Fillon, who just weeks ago was best known as the unsuccessful prime minister from 2007-2012 of a failed French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who mocked him behind his back.\n\n\u201cCourage, Fillon!\u201d Mr. Sarkozy would say derisively, Patrick Buisson, a far-right journalist and one-time adviser to Mr. Sarkozy, wrote in his recent book \u201cThe People\u2019s Cause.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen, Mr. Fillon trumped both Mr. Sarkozy \u2014 humiliating him in Sunday\u2019s round of voting \u2014 and the pollsters.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Fillon won in Paris and in rural France.\n\nMr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s more moderate agenda \u2014 fewer cuts in the Civil Service and public spending, less accommodation of Russia, friendlier to gay couples \u2014 attracted left-leaning voters, which in turn disturbed the right\u2019s traditional electorate.\n\n\u201cIt bothered me that so many people on the left voted for him,\u201d Michel Carron, a rural official who attended the rally here, said of Mr. Jupp\u00e9.\n\nMr. Fillon \u201cdefends our values,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a sort of despair, and he makes us live,\u201d Mr. Carron said, adding that he knows National Front sympathizers who voted for him.\n\nAs in the United States, the pollsters had failed to detect a hidden yearning for the restoration of a mythical older France, rural and dominated by the values of a conservative Roman Catholic Church.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe media, television, they are out of phase with the population, which is fed up with being called xenophobic and racist,\u201d said Ms. Despointes, after Mass outside Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 in Paris.\n\nMr. Fillon is not keen on social changes like same-sex marriage and chafes at being the \u201cvassal\u201d of America, as he put it in his speech here. The crowd at the rally was almost all white.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll help us to find our identity again,\u201d said Jacqueline Badoux, a retired teacher who attended the rally.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn the fight against Islamic State, he will have the authority,\u201d said Ms. Badoux\u2019s husband, Bernard, also a retired teacher, who approved mightily of Mr. Fillon\u2019s performance here.\n\nThe very qualities the mercurial big-city Mr. Sarkozy made fun of, according to Mr. Buisson \u2014 Mr. Fillon\u2019s rural origins and ponderousness, \u201chis legendary caution and his silences\u201d \u2014 earned him favor with the crowd here.\n\n\u201cThis country is the daughter of Christianity, as well as the Enlightenment,\u201d Mr. Fillon told the crowd outside Lyon. \u201cI will put the family back at the heart of all public policy.\u201d The crowd roared.\n\nCatholics are gravitating toward him because \u201cfor the essential values \u2014 family, nation, identity \u2014 Fillon incarnates them with a certain tranquillity,\u201d said the Rev. Pierre-Herv\u00e9 Grosjean, a Versailles priest who writes an influential Catholic blog.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a desire to break with the spirit of May \u201968 and go back to the values of family and education, to a France that is not ashamed of its roots,\u201d said Father Grosjean, referring to a period when thousands of demonstrators took to the streets protesting France\u2019s old-world order. For Catholics, \u201che captures this alliance between conviction and realism,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the rally, Mr. Fillon promised to bring back school uniforms, restore respect in schools and stand up to America.\n\nMr. Fillon is reminiscent of President-elect Donald J. Trump in a significant way: He is friendlier toward Russia and its leader, Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nIndeed, the French news media has detailed his numerous ties to Mr. Putin \u2014 he has stayed at Mr. Putin\u2019s residence at Sochi, according to the newspaper Le Monde, and played billiards with him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe even received a bottle of wine from the Russian leader on the death of his mother, according to the newsmagazine L\u2019Express, which described Mr. Fillon as the French politician who \u201cappreciates\u201d Mr. Putin the most.\n\nSuch concerns, it appears, did little to damage Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy in the United States. Similarly, they may be just as easy to overlook for supporters of Mr. Fillon like Ms. Despointes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of conviction,\u201d she said outside Sainte-Trinit\u00e9. \u201cFor people who have moral values.\u201d"}
