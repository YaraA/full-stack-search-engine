The downing of the Russian airliner followed a larger Islamic State goal to strike Russian interests but was probably carried out autonomously by the group\u2019s affiliate in Egypt, officials said.\n\nAccording to American and European officials, the man overseeing the attacks outside Iraq and Syria is Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, a 38-year-old Syrian who is the official spokesman for the Islamic State and one of the most trusted lieutenants of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group\u2019s supreme leader. But it is in his role as head of external operations that Mr. Adnani has drawn intensified scrutiny from Western officials.\n\nMr. Adnani is best known for a 42-minute audio statement issued on social media in September 2014 in which he called on individual Muslims living in the West to kill civilians in their countries by any means necessary, and to do so without waiting for further instructions from the terrorist group\u2019s leaders.\n\n\u201cIf you can, kill a disbelieving American or European \u2014 especially the spiteful and filthy French \u2014 or an Australian, or a Canadian,\u201d he said. \u201cThen rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way, however it may be. Do not ask for anyone\u2019s advice.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Mr. Adnani now has a $5 million bounty on his head, offered by the United States, and is on the kill list for the American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria. \u201cAdnani has been a key figure in external planning since ISIS rose to prominence over a year ago,\u201d said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Adnani\u2019s stature and operational focus are also revealed in an analysis of nearly 1,000 video messages the Islamic State has disseminated over social media in the past two years, which was conducted by Javier Lesaca, a visiting scholar at George Washington University\u2019s school of media and public affairs.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Mr. Adnani is the Islamic State\u2019s chief spokesman and propagandist, his photograph is not shown by the group in its videos, most likely to protect him. So Mr. Adnani makes frequent audio statements. \u201cISIS has never shown a video with images of al-Adnani,\u201d Mr. Lesaca said. \u201cThe only reason for this is to enhance his security.\u201d\n\nMr. Lesaca\u2019s analysis shows that Russia has received the most threats from the Islamic State in its videos, with more than 25 in two years. France is next with almost 20 in the same time frame, he said.\n\nFrench intelligence officials believe that Mr. Abaaoud, who was killed in a shootout with the police in Paris last week, worked under Mr. Adnani in Syria, impressing his boss by recruiting French-speaking jihadists.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Azaz at the time was a kind of foreign jihadist boomtown, full of enthusiastic new arrivals. According to the activists, Mr. Abaaoud served as the emir, or leader, of foreign fighters there until the Islamic State was pushed out of the area and moved to the east, including to Deir al-Zour.\n\nMr. Abaaoud kept a low profile among civilians there, said Omar Abu Layla, an antigovernment activist from Deir al-Zour, but gained a reputation in skirmishes against groups calling themselves the Free Syrian Army that oppose both the Islamic State and the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s enemies called him \u201cthe mongoose,\u201d for his ability to operate discreetly, quickly and quietly, establishing his presence and power.\n\nWestern officials say the Belgian-born Mr. Abaaoud was eventually assigned a bigger role: to organize attack missions in Europe. There, he drew upon a vast network of radicals and extremists long before the Paris strikes.\n\nThe French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said at a news briefing on Thursday that Mr. Abaaoud, in addition to playing an important role in the Paris attacks, had his hand in at least four of the six plots French authorities had broken up this year.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Belgian counterintelligence official said the Islamic State operated cells like Mr. Abaaoud\u2019s based on language ties, such as a francophone group. The cells are also grouped to facilitate the planning of attacks on areas they are most familiar with. For instance, French plotters who knew which landmarks to strike worked with Belgians who knew they could organize plots and buy weapons, all under the radar, in Belgium.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese cells worked in what the official called a \u201cbamboo\u201d structure \u2014 most militant groups have cells intended to operate separately and in parallel to ensure that if one member is killed or a plot is aborted, the demise would not affect other plots.\n\nJohn O. Brennan, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said last week that the Paris attacks, as well as the downing of the Russian jet over the Sinai Peninsula and the suicide bombings in Beirut, all bore the \u201challmarks\u201d of the Islamic State.\n\nThe timing of the Russian charter jet crash with the attacks in Beirut and Paris is the most visible indication yet that the Sinai Province group may be taking broad guidance from the Islamic State, counterterrorism officials said.\n\n\u201cEurope has been taken by surprise by Daesh\u2019s ability, determination and motivation to carry out such spectacular, coordinated and violent attacks outside the territory it holds instead of focusing on consolidating the caliphate,\u201d said another senior European counterterrorism official, using an Arabic acronym for the group.\n\nIt should not have been. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner to the Islamic State, was always interested in external attacks, notably the bombing of three hotels in Amman, Jordan, in 2005 that killed 60 people, according to American and European intelligence officials.\n\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that the Islamic State\u2019s main priority for its first year had been to consolidate control over territory in Iraq and Syria, but that the external operations cell had grown in stature, first promoting so-called lone-wolf attacks and now most likely directing specific plots.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Paris,\u201d Mr. Schiff said, \u201cwe\u2019re still trying to determine the extent of control by the external branch, and how much discretion was given to the operatives in Europe to pick the time, place and manner of attack.\u201d"}
