Putin of Russia and his oft-repeated goal of reasserting Russian influence in the \u201cnear abroad,\u201d Moscow\u2019s term for the territories of the former Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cThe big loser in all this is Putin,\u201d said Amanda Paul, a researcher at the European Policy Center, a Brussels research group. \u201cHe has gone out of his way to create problems internally in Ukraine but only pushed Ukraine further into the arms of the West than it ever would have gone before. It totally backfired for Putin.\u201d\n\nMoldova and Georgia, two other former Soviet lands that Moscow had pressured not to stray too far from its orbit, also signed agreements with the European Union on Friday. In Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, citizens celebrated with a large public concert, which was broadcast on all major domestic television channels.\n\nThere was jubilation as well in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, after the signing of the agreement. By late afternoon on Friday, several hundred people had gathered in Independence Square, the focal point of months of street protests, many carrying blue balloons with yellow paper stars affixed to them \u2014 replicating the European Union flag \u2014 and released them into the air.\n\nAfter weeks of statements by Mr. Poroshenko vowing to seal the agreement, the Kremlin was well-prepared and immediately began to lay the groundwork for retaliatory measures, including the withdrawal of preferential treatment for Ukrainian exports to Russia under prior agreements between former Soviet republics.\n\nWithin minutes of the signing ceremony, the news agency Interfax quoted Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister as warning that \u201cserious consequences\u201d would follow. The remark was an ominous sign of the vexation caused in Moscow by the tilt toward Europe of lands that Russia, first under czarist and then Soviet rule, for centuries considered its own.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Moscow, Mr. Putin blamed the months of crisis in Ukraine on Western leaders, saying they had forced Kiev to choose between Russia and the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe acute crisis in this neighboring country seriously troubles us,\u201d Mr. Putin said after a ceremony to receive the credentials of foreign diplomats. \u201cThe anti-constitutional coup in Kiev and attempts to artificially impose a choice between Europe and Russia on the Ukrainian people have pushed society toward a split and painful confrontation.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It reminded Kiev of this earlier this month by suspending deliveries of natural gas following a long-running dispute over price. Russia has denied any hand in the violence in eastern Ukraine but has been accused by the West of supporting pro-Russians rebels with guns, money and manpower from across the border in Russia.\n\nGiven the ferocity of the Kremlin\u2019s campaign to prevent completion of the accord between Ukraine and Europe, the reaction by senior officials on Friday was relatively muted, reflecting not only acceptance of the inevitability of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s signing but also the changed circumstances following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, where it has a naval base.\n\n\u201cIn the Kremlin, they are calming down and trying to assess the results of this frenzied state of affairs over the last couple of months,\u201d said Konstantin Sonin, vice rector of the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. \u201cI think we make too much rationalization of what the Kremlin does. I think they were very much driven by events.\u201d\n\nOne of Mr. Putin\u2019s major objections to closer political and economic relations between Ukraine and the West was widely understood to be a concern about NATO expansion, and the risk that would pose to Russia\u2019s military interests in the Crimean peninsula.\n\nRussia has long viewed the European Union as a stalking horse for NATO but, in a move that could help allay such concerns, NATO foreign ministers decided in Brussels earlier this week that a summit meeting in September will not approve offering Georgia a formal step to membership.\n\nThere is no chance of the European Union admitting Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova as members any time soon. Public opinion in Europe is hostile to any further expansion of a 28-nation bloc that is already widely seen as too big and too unwieldy.\n\nAll the same, Europe\u2019s allure to so many people in former Soviet territories has infuriated Moscow, not the least because it contrasts so starkly with the cool reception given Mr. Putin\u2019s efforts to form a rival economic bloc, the Eurasian Union, which is to start up next year. It so far has only three takers, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFar from concluding a period of tumult, the completion of the trade deal, which still needs approval from the Ukrainian Parliament, could further stoke tensions both inside Ukraine and between Moscow and the West.\n\nSenior Russian officials quickly began warning that Russia\u2019s businesses and economy could suffer, as their markets could be flooded with low-cost goods from Europe that skirt tariffs by first being shipped through Ukraine, which will be exempt from most European duties. Other experts have dismissed those concerns, saying Russia is quite adept at identifying and intercepting such goods as they cross the border.\n\nEuropean leaders, meeting Friday at a summit in Brussels dominated by wrangling over who should lead its executive arm for the next five years, announced that they would not immediately impose additional sanctions on Russia for its interference in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. But, they said in a statement that additional sanctions were being prepared and could be deployed \u201cwithout delay\u201d if Russia does not do more to curb violence in eastern Ukraine.\n\nEurope, like the United States, has so far limited its sanctions to an asset freeze and travel ban against a narrow group of Russian political and military figures involved in the March annexation of Crimea.\n\nEuropean leaders set a deadline of next Monday for pro-Russian militants to leave borders posts seized from Ukrainian personnel, to release all hostages, agree to procedures for the verification of a cease-fire and accept \u201csubstantial negotiations\u201d on a peace plan proposed by Mr. Poroshenko.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, in the embattled regional capital of Donetsk, Aleksandr Borodai, a rebel leader from Russia, told reporters that pro-Russian militias were willing to extend a truce until Monday. The Ukrainian government later agreed to do so."}
