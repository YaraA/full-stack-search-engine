{"title": "Sadiq Khan Elected in London, Becoming Its First Muslim Mayor", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/world/europe/britain-election-results.html?_r=0", "body": "Mr. Khan\u2019s victory was also his party\u2019s biggest boost in a series of elections on Thursday in which Labour further lost its grip on Scotland, once a stronghold, and clung, in some cases just barely, to seats in England and Wales.\n\nMr. Khan won with 56.8 percent of the vote, versus 43.2 percent for Mr. Goldsmith, according to London\u2019s election body. The results were not final until Saturday morning because in London\u2019s electoral system voters are allowed a first and second preference, and Mr. Khan did not win an outright majority in the first round.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Mr. Khan said that the mayoral election \u201cwas not without controversy\u201d and added that he was \u201cproud that London has today chosen hope over fear and unity over division.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that we will never be offered such a stark choice again. Fear does not make us safer, it only makes us weaker and the politics of fear is simply not welcome in our city.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Khan\u2019s campaign focused on bread-and-butter issues like the cost of housing and transportation. He drew strong support from labor unions and kept a careful distance from his party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist who has an ardent base among young voters but faces heavy resistance among fellow Labour lawmakers.\n\nIn the past week, the Labour Party was distracted by a dispute over anti-Semitism that led to the suspension of a lawmaker, Naseem Shah, and a former London mayor, Ken Livingstone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Khan argued that, as an observant Muslim, he was well placed to tackle extremism. \u201cI\u2019m a Londoner, I\u2019m European, I\u2019m British, I\u2019m English, I\u2019m of Islamic faith, of Asian origin, of Pakistani heritage, a dad, a husband,\u201d he said in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\nThe fifth of eight children, Mr. Khan was born in Tooting, South London, to recent immigrants from Pakistan, and grew up in a public-housing project. His father drove a bus, and his mother was a seamstress.\n\nElected to Parliament in 2005, Mr. Khan was appointed a junior minister for communities in 2008, and minister for transport in 2009 under the last Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown. Although he was not one of the highest-ranking ministers, he became the first Muslim to attend cabinet meetings regularly and was admitted to the Privy Council, a largely ceremonial body in which induction normally requires taking an oath to the queen.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe palace called me and said, \u2018What type of Bible do you want to swear on?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Khan told the magazine The New Statesman. \u201cWhen I said the Quran, they said, \u2018We haven\u2019t got one.\u2019 So I took one with me.\u201d\n\nAs London\u2019s mayor, he will have significant power over transportation and planning \u2014 as well as responsibilities for the police, civil defense and fire services \u2014 in a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network.\n\nMr. Khan will succeed Boris Johnson, a Conservative who has held the post since 2008 and is a leading figure in the campaign for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. That vote will take place on June 23. Mr. Johnson is seen as a possible successor to Mr. Cameron as leader of the Conservatives, particularly if Britain votes to leave; Mr. Cameron is campaigning for Britain to remain.\n\nWithin Britain, the news of the collapse of the Labour Party in Scotland was almost as big as Mr. Khan\u2019s victory.\n\nThe Scottish National Party won its third straight victory in the Scottish Parliament \u2014 a triumph that its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, called historic, even though the party narrowly lost its majority. The Labour Party fell to a humiliating third place, behind the Conservatives, who won seats in part by appealing to Scots opposed to independence. Scots rejected independence in a 2014 referendum, but there is speculation that a new referendum could be called, particularly if Britain leaves the European Union.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Ms. Sturgeon said she planned to lead a minority government rather than seeking a coalition with smaller parties. The Conservatives captured 31 seats, and Labour 24.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Labour Party have completely lost touch with the hard-working people they\u2019re supposed to represent,\u201d Mr. Cameron, the prime minister, said.\n\nIn Wales, Labour remained the biggest party, though the U.K. Independence Party, which favors leaving the European Union, entered the Welsh Assembly for the first time, winning seven seats.\n\nIn England, Labour won two by-elections to the British Parliament, and a Labour mayor, Joe Anderson, won a second term in Liverpool. Labour also kept control of local councils in crucial English communities like Crawley, Southampton, Norwich and Hastings, where the party had been thought vulnerable.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s troubles have taken the focus from the Conservatives, who are deeply divided over the June 23 referendum on European Union membership.\n\nGiven that Mr. Cameron\u2019s government has recently faced crises over the steel industry and a strike by junior doctors, his party\u2019s gains in Scotland were sorely needed good news.\n\nAs for Mr. Corbyn, he said that Labour had defied its critics and \u201chung on\u201d in England, though he conceded that there was \u201ca lot of building to do in Scotland.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Khan\u2019s victory was also his party\u2019s biggest boost in a series of elections on Thursday in which Labour further lost its grip on Scotland, once a stronghold, and clung, in some cases just barely, to seats in England and Wales.
