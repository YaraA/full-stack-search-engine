That would sweeten the deal for Turkey, but any agreement among European countries on expanding resettlement may come only at the end of the year after the European Commission, the European Union executive body, prepares a draft plan.\n\n\u201cIt is an uphill effort, but it is well worth the effort,\u201d Ms. Merkel said Sunday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before the meeting, Ms. Merkel said that Europe had many reasons to work closely with Turkey but that the essential part of the negotiations was the need to \u201creplace illegal migration with legal migration.\u201d Her statement reflects a hope that the unruly flow of asylum seekers \u2014 a mix of refugees fleeing war and economic migrants seeking a better life \u2014 can be brought under control before the people reach Europe.\n\nEurope wants Turkey\u2019s help in identifying those it considers genuine refugees, notably Syrians, who would be allowed entry in an orderly fashion, and in halting people fleeing poverty who do not have an obvious right to protection under international law.\n\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council, the body representing European leaders, set out Europe\u2019s objective in blunt terms. \u201cWe expect a major step toward changing the rules of the game when it comes to stemming the migration flow that is coming to the E.U. via Turkey,\u201d he said late Sunday. He described Turkey as a \u201ckey strategic partner\u201d on issues like counterterrorism and the civil war in Syria.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Mr. Tusk insisted that Europe itself needed to do more to secure its borders and that it could not \u201coutsource this obligation to any third country,\u201d like Turkey. Failing to protect the Continent\u2019s outer borders, he warned, would mean that one of Europe\u2019s most important achievements, the 26-nation visa-free zone established by the Schengen agreement, \u201cwill become history.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Leaders first endorsed a so-called action plan with Turkey more than a month ago, but it was delayed by haggling over details. The Europeans still have not agreed on how to raise the money earmarked for Turkey, and putting the agreement into effect will ultimately depend on Mr. Erdogan.\n\nThere were also warnings that the deal, even if put into effect, might not diminish the flow of migrants any time soon.\n\nGerald Knaus, the chairman of the European Stability Initiative, a research organization in Berlin, said that Germany and other countries would need to resettle \u201csizable numbers\u201d of Syrian refugees from Turkey to relieve the pressure there. Turkey, he said, will also need to take back migrants that reach Greek islands close to the Turkish coast if that migration route is to be sealed off. Without that commitment and others, Mr. Knaus added, \u201cwe will see more refugees crossing, more drowning, more recriminations between the European Union and Turkey and an even worse relationship two months from now.\u201d\n\nEurope\u2019s negotiations with Turkey have been dogged by concerns in some quarters that the country is becoming increasingly authoritarian and that it violates the rights of the president\u2019s critics, journalists and members of the Kurdish minority.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a systematic regress of the rule of law and fundamental freedoms in Turkey,\u201d Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, said Saturday. \u201cIt must be crystal clear that cooperation requires respect for basic rights.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel on Sunday defended the outreach to Turkey, noting that, despite sheltering so many refugees, it \u201chad received little international support for that and therefore rightly expects that the European Union and the member states attempt to lighten Turkey\u2019s burden.\u201d\n\nEurope was also offering Turkey the chance to resume regular summit meetings. In addition, Turkey won a promise to speed up negotiations on visa-free travel for its citizens to the European Union, as well as a resumption of negotiations on full membership in the bloc.\n\nHaving failed to bring the migrant flow under control after many meetings and failed action plans, Europe is now hoping that Turkey will help it curb a crisis that has opened up deep divisions between countries and led to dark warnings that the European Union could collapse under the strain. Efforts to control the number of people passing through the bloc\u2019s external borders have been largely ineffective, and a plan announced in May to relocate migrants from front-line states like Greece and Italy has barely started.", "summary": "Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Ms. Merkel said that Europe had many reasons to work closely with Turkey but that the essential part of the negotiations was the need to \u201creplace illegal migration with legal migration.\u201d Her statement reflects a hope that the unruly flow of asylum seekers \u2014 a mix of refugees fleeing war and economic migrants seeking a better life \u2014 can be brought under control before the people reach Europe.Europe wants Turkey\u2019s help in identifying those it considers genuine refugees, notably Syrians, who would be allowed entry in an orderly fashion, and in halting people fleeing poverty who do not have an obvious right to protection under international law.Gerald Knaus, the chairman of the European Stability Initiative, a research organization in Berlin, said that Germany and other countries would need to resettle \u201csizable numbers\u201d of Syrian refugees from Turkey to relieve the pressure there.Europe\u2019s negotiations with Turkey have been dogged by concerns in some quarters that the country is becoming increasingly authoritarian and that it violates the rights of the president\u2019s critics, journalists and members of the Kurdish minority.Efforts to control the number of people passing through the bloc\u2019s external borders have been largely ineffective, and a plan announced in May to relocate migrants from front-line states like Greece and Italy has barely started."}
