What should I do?\u201d\n\nSara said she had not yet formally lodged a complaint because she was sick, but intended to do so.\n\nAccording to the police reports, the precinct closest to the station received 30 to 50 complaints of sexual assault and theft in the first hour of the New Year. Women who came to the precinct were crying; several of them left when the sole female officer available could not quickly note their complaint.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

By late Jan. 2, the police issued an online appeal for people to come forward if they had experienced or witnessed crime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince then, the police have received 653 complaints of robberies and sexual assaults, and several rapes. The mother of a 19-year-old who said she had been raped called the police by 10 a.m. on Jan. 1, and officers went to the teenager\u2019s hotel, getting her and two other women to a gynecological exam.\n\nEven the relatively dry language of the police report issued this week \u2014 summarizing at least 90 complaints of sexual harassment \u2014 makes the situation graphically clear. It refers over and over to victims surrounded by men and \u201cgroped in intimate area,\u201d \u201cgrabbed by breasts and bottoms,\u201d or even \u201cfingers inserted in vagina.\u201d\n\nRainer Wendt, head of the national police union, conceded in an interview that Cologne police commanders committed several errors \u2014 beginning with scheduling extra police deployment only for 10 p.m.\n\nBut he said there was no way to have foreseen the mass drunkenness and the crowds on the square, which is not the traditional center of celebrations in the city.\n\n\u201cYou are always wiser after the fact,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year, the police deployment in Cologne was planned exactly on the same lines, and it was sufficient.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nRalf J\u00e4ger, the interior minister of North Rhine Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, noted that drink and drugs exacerbated the situation. \u201cAfter alcohol and drug excesses came the excesses of violence, peaking with people who carried out fantasies of sexual power,\u201d he told state legislators on Monday.\n\nThe hope now is that surveillance videos from the police and state railway cameras in the station, from nearby businesses and hotels, and above all from cellphones will help to identify the perpetrators. The police have 135 officers sifting 350 hours of video, they say.\n\nOf 19 suspects so far identified by name by the Cologne police, 10 were asylum seekers and the other nine were believed to be in Germany illegally, according to a report by Mr. J\u00e4ger, the interior minister.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNone were registered as living in Cologne, and four are now in custody for robberies committed during the New Year\u2019s events. An additional 32 suspects have been identified by the federal police, including 22 asylum seekers but also three Germans and an American, among others, the report said.\n\nFully unraveling the Cologne events is expected to take several weeks, however. The police are also examining whether similar events reported from other cities \u2014 Hamburg, with over 100 complaints, but also Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Nuremberg \u2014 are connected, or even organized.\n\nHolger M\u00fcnch, the head of the federal criminal police, said Tuesday that \u201cit is not organized crime,\u201d but \u201cwhat we see here is perpetrators communicating with each other and making arrangements.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must recognize better where they do this, how they do this,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcnch told RBB Inforadio.\n\nMr. Wendt, head of the national police union, said that the authorities in Cologne and several other cities were hurriedly revising their deployment plans for carnival, which is celebrated with mass parades and revelry, particularly in cities up and down the Rhine. The main day is Rose Monday, on Feb. 8 this year.\n\nThe police and the state government in Mainz, a main carnival center, detailed extra plans this week, including creating special passages to allow women to leave raucous crowds, more bodycams for police officers and steps to explain carnival to newcomers who have never seen such celebrations.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in Germany,\u201d Mr. Wendt said, \u201cpolitical decisions are somehow made only after the house is on fire.\u201d", "summary": "Even the relatively dry language of the police report issued this week \u2014 summarizing at least 90 complaints of sexual harassment \u2014 makes the situation graphically clear.
