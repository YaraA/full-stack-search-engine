{"title": "Theresa May Is Poised to Be Britain\u2019s Next Prime Minister", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/world/europe/andrea-leadsom-theresa-may-britain.html", "body": "Ms. May said that she was \u201chonored and humbled\u201d to be chosen for the job, promised to get the best deal over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, and vowed to create an economy that works not for the \u201cprivileged few,\u201d but for all.\n\nThe British referendum on June 23 plunged the European Union into crisis. It left Britain rudderless as the pound sank in value and both the governing and opposition parties engaged in fierce and acrimonious leadership battles. Mr. Cameron, who had supported remaining in the European Union, said after the referendum that he would resign once the governing Conservatives selected a new leader, a process that he had expected to last until September but that was drastically accelerated on Monday.\n\nAfter making a brief statement describing his successor as \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201ccompetent,\u201d Mr. Cameron was caught on a microphone humming as he returned to his office.\n\nMr. Cameron\u2019s statement completed a day of high political drama in which Ms. May\u2019s rival for the Conservative Party leadership, Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, withdrew from the race. Leading party members quickly coalesced around Ms. May, insisting that the contest should not be reopened. A party committee agreed.\n\nVideo\n\nMs. Leadsom had already faced accusations \u2014 which she denied \u2014 of embellishing her curriculum vitae, but her campaign ran aground over the weekend after The Times of London published an interview in which she suggested that she was a better candidate because she is a mother, while Ms. May is not.\n\nSurrounded by supportive lawmakers, Ms. Leadsom on Monday made no reference to that issue, but said that she was quitting the contest and endorsing Ms. May, and that she hoped to see her installed as prime minister \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe turn of events meant that Ms. May would become prime minister without a general election and without completing the campaign she and Ms. Leadsom had been waging for the endorsement of the Conservative Party\u2019s rank-and-file members.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast week, the former Conservative cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke described Ms. May as a \u201cbloody difficult woman,\u201d noting that he had worked for another female politician of similar temperament, namely Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nFar from being insulted, Ms. May used the comment to suggest that her negotiating stance with European officials would be as tough as that of Mrs. Thatcher, who went into battle on the Continent, particularly over British financial contributions to the bloc.\n\n\u201cKen Clarke might have found me to be a \u2018bloody difficult woman.\u2019 The next person to find that out will be Jean-Claude Juncker,\u201d she told fellow Conservative lawmakers, referring to the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive, ITV reported.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There were growing fears on Monday that the party might split because of the bitter dispute.\n\nVideo\n\nNevertheless, opposition politicians called for a general election and questioned Ms. May\u2019s democratic mandate, since she will assume the job on the basis of an internal transfer of power within the governing party. So far, Ms. May has rejected the notion of a quick general election.\n\nHer top priority will be to frame a negotiating strategy for leaving the union, after the referendum in which she sided with those who wanted to remain.\n\nOn Monday, Ms. May insisted that \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d as she sought to reassure right-wingers that she was committed to the policy, adding that \u201cthere will be no attempt to remain inside the E.U. There will be no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, no second referendum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, while 52 percent of voters supported Brexit, they did so for differing reasons, including reasserting national sovereignty and opposition to migration from within the bloc, which guarantees the right to live and work within any member nation.\n\nMs. May is expected to take a tough stance on immigration in part because she is politically vulnerable on the issue. As home secretary, she failed to fulfill a Conservative pledge to control the number of people arriving in Britain. The numbers persistently exceeded targets and included arrivals of non-Europeans, which the government had the power to curb.\n\nMs. May has signaled her intention to restrict migration from Europe, even if doing so hurt Britain\u2019s position in negotiating a new trade deal with the bloc. She will also be under pressure from big business to secure the best possible access to Europe\u2019s single market, which normally entails accepting the principle of free movement of workers across national frontiers.\n\nOne important question for Ms. May is when to invoke Article 50 of the European Union\u2019s governing treaty, which starts the withdrawal procedure. That effectively sets a two-year deadline for a deal to be struck. She has suggested that she intends to wait until her government has settled on its negotiating stance before invoking the article despite pressure from Europe\u2019s leaders to act more quickly.\n\nOn Monday she said more about her wider political agenda in a speech that offered plans to address some of the economic and social inequalities evident in Britain. Those include populist resentments thought to have motivated many pro-Brexit voters in economically depressed areas outside London and in the affluent southeast of England.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing divide between a more prosperous older generation and a struggling younger generation. And there is a gaping chasm between wealthy London and the rest of the country,\u201d she said, positioning herself in a centrist tradition of \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism.\n\nSpeaking in Birmingham, England, Ms. May also called for efforts to increase productivity, for employees and consumers to gain seats on company boards and for votes on executive pay to become binding rather than advisory. Big multinationals should pay their share of taxes, she said, adding: \u201cWhether you\u2019re Amazon, Google or Starbucks, you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to your fellow citizens, you have a responsibility to pay your taxes.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Cameron, who had supported remaining in the European Union, said after the referendum that he would resign once the governing Conservatives selected a new leader, a process that he had expected to last until September but that was drastically accelerated on Monday.
