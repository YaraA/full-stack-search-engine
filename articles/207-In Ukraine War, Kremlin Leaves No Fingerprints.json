And on Thursday, rebel leaders shipped 33 coffins back to Russia through a remarkably porous border, announcing that the overwhelming majority of those killed in Monday\u2019s battle with the Ukrainian Army were Russian citizens.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Putin may not be directing these events, but he is certainly their principal beneficiary. Instability in Ukraine\u2019s east makes the country less palatable to the European Union and more vulnerable to Russian demands, forming a kind of insurance policy for future influence by Russia, which, at least so far, has avoided further sanctions from the West. Leaders of the Group of 7 countries will meet in Brussels on Wednesday, including President Obama, and Russia\u2019s role in Ukraine is at the top of the agenda.\n\n\u201cThey are creating facts on the ground,\u201d said Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cThe goal is clear: build structural guarantees against Ukraine\u2019s potential NATO accession. Plausible deniability is key.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Thursday expressed \u201cdeep concern in connection with the further escalation of the situation in eastern Ukraine,\u201d but did not address the Russian deaths. A request for comment on the Russian bodies and on Mr. Borodai went unanswered.\n\nReality in Ukraine seems constantly in flux, and the fact that the country has a new president-elect after careening headless for months could shift the kaleidoscope again. Petro O. Poroshenko, who was elected in a landslide last Sunday, is expected to meet Mr. Putin this summer, and if the two men are able to strike a deal, then Russian support for the separatists may wane, some experts said, though that will not necessarily stop them.\n\n\u201cRussia will keep supporting separatists below the radar as insurance to make sure Poroshenko agrees to a deal,\u201d said Dmitry Gorenburg, a senior research scientist for the CNA Corporation, a nonprofit research group in Washington. \u201cOnce the deal is done, I think Putin will drop them.\u201d\n\nBut much has changed between Ukraine and its giant neighbor in recent months and it is not clear how much their interests will overlap. Nor is Kiev entirely without cards to play. On Monday its military inflicted serious damage on the largely Russian separatist force, killing more than 40 fighters and raising the possibility that the military has at least some chance of succeeding.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat Russia would do if that started to happen is an open question. But for now, at least, the strategy seems to be to destabilize Ukraine as much as possible without leaving conclusive evidence that would trigger more sanctions.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he has blinked,\u201d said Matthew Rojansky, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center\u2019s Kennan Institute, referring to Mr. Putin\u2019s not invading eastern Ukraine. \u201cHe has eased up because he sees a situation that he likes better.\u201d\n\nThat leaves Mr. Borodai as a central figure in Ukraine\u2019s immediate future. He may seem to have come out of nowhere, but in Russia he is a known quantity. He comes from a group of ultranationalists who were part of the far-right Zavtra newspaper in the 1990s. Their Pan-Slavic ideas, aiming for the unity of Slavic peoples, were considered marginal at the time. But they have now moved into the mainstream, helping formulate the worldview of today\u2019s Kremlin, said Oleg Kashin, a Russian investigative journalist who has written extensively about Mr. Borodai.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the Karl Rove of Russian imperialism,\u201d said Irena Chalupa, a fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Surrounded by armed guards with scowling faces, Mr. Borodai stood with a microphone at the center of a large crowd that had gathered last weekend outside the compound of a local oligarch. They wanted to break in and declare it national property.\n\n\u201cI know many of you want a tour,\u201d he said smiling, as the crowd cheered. \u201cI respect that desire. But right now a tour is not possible.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Borodai said that he and Mr. Strelkov, the Russian rebel commander in Slovyansk, had both gone to Transnistria, a breakaway area in Moldova, to defend the rights of Russians in the 1990s. He named the cities in Russia that volunteers have come from, including Novosibirsk, Vladivostok and Chita. He said he believed in the idea of a Greater Russia, and that he had come to Ukraine to realize it. \u201cReal Ukrainians have the right to live as they like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can create their own state which would be named Ukraine, or however they like, because the word Ukraine is a little humiliating,\u201d he said, asserting that the literal translation meant \u201con the border of.\u201d (The etymology is disputed.)\n\nHe explained that Ukrainians \u201chave their heroes, their values, their religion,\u201d but that \u201cwe also want to live as we want to live. We think that we have that right. And if we need to, we will assert that right.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRoman Szporluk, emeritus professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard University, said such language was worrying. \u201cPutin would like to Yugoslavize Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants to create an ethnic conflict where one did not exist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo one here seems to know where Mr. Borodai came from or what his allegiances are. But such things do not matter. \u201cThey are good guys, they are our guys, they are protecting us against Kiev\u2019s aggression,\u201d said Lidia Lisichkina, a 55-year-old geologist who is an ethnic Russian.\n\nMr. Kashin, the investigative journalist, does not believe that either Mr. Borodai or Mr. Strelkov is acting on behalf of the Russian government. \u201cThis is not the hand of Moscow, it\u2019s just Borodai,\u201d Mr. Kashin said.\n\nLocal rebel leaders say their goals coincide. Roman Lyagin, an election specialist from Donetsk who is responsible for pensions and wages in the new republic (so far they are still paid by Kiev), said one of the main tasks is to push separatist control farther west to \u201ccreate a land route from Russia to Crimea.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople there need oatmeal, television and underwear,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the regional administration building on Friday, Mr. Borodai was busy consolidating his power, holding his first government meeting after his forces swept out the local separatists.\n\nThe former National Guard base was buzzing with activity. A white minivan full of armed men in black balaclavas zoomed out of a large metal gate, its purple curtains pulled partly closed. A man wearing civilian clothes carried two large black bags to a hatchback station wagon and sped away.\n\nOutside the gate, Mamai, the Ossetian fighter, said he had not come to Ukraine for money. He had a business doing security for banks in Vladikavkaz, where he lives. \u201cEveryone who wants to be with Russia,\u201d he said, \u201cthose are our brothers.\u201d"}
