{"title": "Once in the Shadows, Europe\u2019s Neo-Fascists Are Re-emerging", "authors": ["Rick Lyman"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/19/world/europe/europe-neo-fascist-revival-slovakia.html", "body": "\u201cBefore, pro-fascist sentiments were kept hidden,\u201d said Gabriel Sipos, director of Transparency International Slovakia. \u201cParents would tell their children, \u2018You cannot say this at school.\u2019 Now, you can say things in the public space that you couldn\u2019t say before.\u201d\n\nAlthough nationalist parties have thrived across Europe in recent years, only a few \u2014 Golden Dawn in Greece and the National Democratic Party in Germany, to name two \u2014 embrace neo-fascist views. Some, like Jobbik in Hungary, are extremist in their right-wing views but stop short of outright fascism.\n\nPhoto\n\nInstead, the broader impact of these groups has been measured in how they have pushed mainstream parties in a more firmly nationalist direction \u2014 especially on immigration \u2014 to slow the defection of supporters.\n\n\u201cNow, extremists and fascists are part of the system,\u201d said Grigorij Meseznikov, president of the Institute for Public Affairs, a liberal research group.\n\nIn Slovakia, neo-fascism has established something of a beachhead. Mr. Svec is joining a political field where a party with an established neo-fascist leader, Marian Kotleba, demonstrated surprising strength in last year\u2019s parliamentary elections, winning 14 seats in the 150-member chamber.\n\nPre-election polls showed his party getting less than 3 percent of the vote, but his result \u2014 8 percent \u2014 was built on strong support from young people and other first-time voters. More recent polls show his support nearing 13 percent. He had already stunned Slovakia in 2013 by winning the governorship of Banska Bystrica, one of Slovakia\u2019s eight regions.\n\nMr. Kotleba, 39, who recently renamed his party Kotleba \u2014 People\u2019s Party Our Slovakia, used to appear in uniforms reminiscent of those worn during the wartime Slovak State. Once he and his party got into Parliament, the uniforms disappeared and he shifted his attacks from Jews to immigrants and the country\u2019s Roma minority.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey used to turn up at gay pride parades, show their muscle, turn up the heat,\u201d said Michal Havran, a television talk-show host and political commentator. \u201cNow, they don\u2019t go; they are worried about their image.\u201d\n\nBut the underlying message of groups like Mr. Kotleba\u2019s and Mr. Svec\u2019s has not shifted \u2014 Slovakia was better off under a fascist government.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSomething very dark and very troubling from the past is coming back,\u201d Mr. Havran said. \u201cThey feel they are fighting for something very pure, something very old and sacred. A few years ago, they were ashamed to talk about it. Now, they are proud.\u201d\n\nIn Banska Bystrica, Mr. Kotleba\u2019s powers as governor include overseeing schools, cultural institutions and some infrastructure projects.\n\n\u201cIf you are a white, heterosexual man, you probably don\u2019t notice any difference living in a place where Kotleba is governor,\u201d said Rado Sloboda, 26, one of a group of Banska Bystrica activists opposing Mr. Kotleba under the banner \u201cNot in Our Town.\u201d \u201cIf you are a minority, like a Roma, you feel it more keenly. There is a feeling that they are even less welcome in the center city.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When told that repeated calls had not been returned, he asked the name of the newspaper. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cThat explains it.\u201d\n\nMr. Kotleba\u2019s party has been especially effective on social media, with more than 140 interconnected Facebook pages. When a local retiree, Jan Bencik, 68, began blogging to expose the country\u2019s neo-fascists, his name appeared on a list of \u201copponents of the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey called me a Jew, said that I should die, die, die,\u201d Mr. Bencik said. \u201cThey said that people like me would be dealt with in the future.\u201d\n\nOne of the ironies of Mr. Kotleba\u2019s coming to power in Banska Bystrica is that it was the center of the anti-fascist Slovak National Uprising during the war and is home to the national museum commemorating that event.\n\nPhoto\n\nStanislav Micev, the museum director, characterized Mr. Kotleba\u2019s message as \u201cfascism with elements of Nazism,\u201d mixing Mussolini\u2019s strongman rule with Hitler\u2019s demonization of minorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are against Americans, Hungarians, Jews, black people and yellow people,\u201d Mr. Micev said. \u201cHis current positions are right on the edge of what is legal.\u201d\n\nAs a newcomer on the neo-fascist political scene, Mr. Svec regards Mr. Kotleba as a potential rival for the same angry vote. At the Jozef Tiso memorial ceremony, the top officials in Mr. Svec\u2019s movement wore matching dark suits with white shirts and bright red ties. A table in the back of the room did a brisk business selling Slovak Revival Movement patches, stickers, key rings, calendars, cookies and bottles of wine (white only) labeled \u201cYear of Jozef Tiso.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people in power want Slovaks to be ashamed of their history,\u201d said Martin Lacko, a historian and supporter of Mr. Svec. \u201cThey want them to keep apologizing. That\u2019s why they keep talking about deportations of Jews during the war and other negative things.\u201d\n\nA group of gray-haired singers in folk costumes, accompanied by a clarinet and an accordion, performed a series of patriotic favorites. \u201cSlovak moms, you have beautiful sons,\u201d they sang.\n\nA pair of university students with floppy hair and denim sat in the back corner, whispering during the speeches and snatching pastries from a nearby table during breaks. Both said they considered themselves devout and conservative, and did not believe Mr. Svec and Mr. Kotleba were extremist in any way. They also pointed to the election of President Trump as a good thing.\n\n\u201cI have to say, the U.S. election results made me extremely happy,\u201d said Martin Bornik, 23.\n\nIn an interview after the ceremony, Mr. Svec rejected the notion that his group is neo-Nazi.\n\n\u201cWhen Americans bring their flags to parks or to public events, nobody says anything,\u201d Mr. Svec said. \u201cWhen we do it, they call us neo-Nazis. You know, labeling someone is the easiest thing to do.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Svec is joining a political field where a party with an established neo-fascist leader, Marian Kotleba, demonstrated surprising strength in last year\u2019s parliamentary elections, winning 14 seats in the 150-member chamber.Stanislav Micev, the museum director, characterized Mr. Kotleba\u2019s message as \u201cfascism with elements of Nazism,\u201d mixing Mussolini\u2019s strongman rule with Hitler\u2019s demonization of minorities.At the Jozef Tiso memorial ceremony, the top officials in Mr. Svec\u2019s movement wore matching dark suits with white shirts and bright red ties.A table in the back of the room did a brisk business selling Slovak Revival Movement patches, stickers, key rings, calendars, cookies and bottles of wine (white only) labeled \u201cYear of Jozef Tiso.\u201dA pair of university students with floppy hair and denim sat in the back corner, whispering during the speeches and snatching pastries from a nearby table during breaks."}
