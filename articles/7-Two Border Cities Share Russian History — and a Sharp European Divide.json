The average salary there is around $500, barely half what it is in Narva. The gap in pensions is even wider.\n\nLeonid Pelesev, an ethnic Russian who coaches Narva schoolchildren in chess, said that many of his fellow Russian-speakers in the Estonian town watch Russian state television and support, on an emotional level, the muscular nationalism promoted by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin. But, he added, no one he knows actually wants to live in Russia.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe are all Russians, but we have a different mentality here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are used to European ways.\u201d\n\nThe youth center in Narva where he teaches chess has three well-heated rooms set aside for players. Enthusiasts across the river in Ivangorod, mostly retirees, gather in a sports complex, which provides a small, frigid room three times a week for a chess club run by a Soviet war veterans association.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIvangorod has seen some improvements. Only a few years ago, the city looked like a wreck, and there was little hot water and no sewage treatment. That is no longer the case. But lately, with Russia\u2019s budget squeeze because of falling energy prices, the money has largely stopped coming.\n\nIn Ivangorod, the town\u2019s biggest attraction, aside from a fortress first built in 1492, is the newly renovated Church of the Holy Trinity, a charming cluster of spires and cupolas on the edge of a lake. It fell into ruin during the Soviet period but has been lavishly renovated with money from Russia\u2019s state railway company.\n\nThe church, along with the fortress and various museums, make Ivangorod an attractive destination for tourists. But getting them to come is not easy: Russian law and its security apparatus have put Ivangorod out of bounds for all but the most determined visitors.\n\nPhoto\n\nAll Russians who live outside the border area and any foreigner who wants to visit must submit a written application in Russian and obtain permission from the Leningrad Region branch of the F.S.B., the successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B. It took a reporter for The New York Times two applications and four months to get the permits needed to spend time in Ivangorod.\n\nSvetlana Valishvili, who edits Ivangorod\u2019s only newspaper, teaches at a school and runs a center to help small businesses, said she had been trying for years to get foreigners to visit and to invest in her town but had been frustrated by the entrance restrictions.\n\nIvangorod\u2019s mayor, Mr. Karpenko, acknowledged that the town\u2019s classification as a restricted border zone \u201cdoes not help us develop tourism.\u201d It puts the town at a distinct disadvantage to Narva, which also has a fortress and museums but is open to anyone who lives in Estonia or is a foreign visitor.\n\nRed tape and other complications also stalled the rebuilding and long-awaited reopening of a bridge for pedestrians between Ivangorod and Narva that has been closed since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and turned what had been a single city into two towns in two countries.\n\nThe walkway, crucial to the revival of a derelict district of Ivangorod filled with the ruins of grand 19th-century buildings, was supposed to open last year. But a state-run Russian company that contracted to erect a customs building on the Russian side failed to complete its work.\n\nPhoto\n\nOther plans to lift Ivangorod\u2019s fortunes have similarly stumbled, including a European Union-funded project that would have started a shuttle bus service to Narva. The project was abandoned after the Russian town demanded more than $4 million to build a bus stop, while Narva, where salaries are higher and construction materials more expensive, asked for $1 million to construct its bus shelter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRussia\u2019s difficulty in keeping budgets and work schedules under control has helped create the biggest, or at least most visible, difference between Ivangorod and its Estonian neighbor: the state of their infrastructure.\n\nOn the Estonian side, streets are generally clean and well-repaired, while many in Ivangorod are scarred by potholes and, in the fall, scattered with leaves and other debris. Each town has a large stock of ugly, Soviet-era apartment buildings, but while those in Ivangorod show their age, Narva\u2019s have been given a face-lift and their grounds mostly cleared of weeds and garbage.\n\nAs each part of the sundered city went its own way after the collapse of the Soviet Union, both struggled with the same economic calamities as Soviet-era factories went bankrupt. A giant textile plant in Narva laid off more than 10,000 workers, while a printing machine plant and other manufacturers crumbled in Ivangorod.\n\nPublic discontent grew so severe that calls went out on both sides of the river for a redrawing of the border to make the city whole again. An opposition member of Ivangorod\u2019s local council, Yuri Gordeyev, collected signatures for a petition asking that Estonia incorporate the Russian city.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat effort, begun in the late 1990s under President Boris N. Yeltsin, fizzled when Mr. Gordeyev died in 2012 of a heart attack and Ivangorod\u2019s once-boisterous local politics gave way to a new era of lock-step loyalty to Mr. Putin.\n\nWhen Russia seized Crimea in 2014 and began stirring up separatist unrest in eastern Ukraine, there was widespread concern in Western capitals that Narva might also fall prey to jingoistic Russian propaganda and, as happened in Ukraine, to separatist subversion by Russian soldiers and secret agents masquerading as local activists.\n\nTarmo Tammiste, Narva\u2019s mayor, recalled how, when traveling abroad, he was constantly asked whether Narva might be next.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNarva is not next and never will be,\u201d he said. \u201cRussians here do not want to go back to the motherland.\u201d\n\nSome people are moving across the border to set up new homes, but they are mostly citizens of Russia buying property in Estonia either as an investment or as a way to get access to Narva\u2019s better health care and the security offered by the European Union, of which Estonia is a member.\n\nAleksandr Bogens, the head of a real estate company in Narva, said that around half of all property transactions in Narva-Joesuu, a nearby resort area on the Baltic Sea, involved purchases by buyers from Russia.\n\nEven stalwart Russian patriots in Narva concede that, despite their support for Mr. Putin and their anger at Estonian citizenship rules that they say discriminate against Russian speakers, they have no desire to move over the river to Ivangorod.\n\n\u201cIt is not really even a town over there \u2014 just a road or two,\u201d scoffed Vladimir Petrov, the leader of the Union of Russian Citizens, a group that lobbies on behalf of Russians living in Narva. \u201cOf course it is better here in Narva than in Ivangorod.\u201d", "summary": "Enthusiasts across the river in Ivangorod, mostly retirees, gather in a sports complex, which provides a small, frigid room three times a week for a chess club run by a Soviet war veterans association.
