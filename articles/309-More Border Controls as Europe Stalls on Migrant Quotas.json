{"title": "More Border Controls as Europe Stalls on Migrant Quotas", "authors": ["Andrew Higgins", "James Kanter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/world/europe/europe-migrant-crisis.html", "body": "In a sign of the disharmony caused by Europe\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis since World War II, ministers did not issue a joint final statement as is customary and left Luxembourg to issue a summary of the discussions in its own name.\n\nThe rancorous haggling in Brussels over the distribution of 160,000 migrants \u2014 a small part of the total \u2014 played out as Austria, Slovakia and the Netherlands introduced border controls on Monday, after a decision by Germany on Sunday to set up checks on its own southwestern frontier and halt train traffic with Austria.\n\nThe reintroduction of border controls, described as a temporary measure to restore order to an often chaotic flow of migrants, was the most serious challenge in years to Europe\u2019s cherished system of passport-free travel across much of the Continent.\n\nThe 26 European countries that are party to the so-called Schengen Agreement, a cornerstone of European integration that enshrines open borders but also allows for temporary controls for security reasons, have in the past periodically reinstated checks but never because of pressures from migration.\n\nThe reintroduction of controls also threatened to create an unpredictable patchwork of complications and potentially risky obstacles for migrants seeking to make their way through Europe to preferred destinations in places like Germany or Sweden, where benefits are greater and the processing of asylum applications moves faster.\n\nThe desperation to reach such countries, even as border controls have been tightened, has increasingly driven migrants and refugees into the hands of smugglers, leading recently to the deaths of 71 migrants who suffocated in the back of a truck along a highway in Austria.\n\nIn Hungary, the authorities said that a near-record 5,353 migrants had crossed into the country from Serbia before noon on Monday \u2014 even as Budapest continued to try to seal off that border, which is being reinforced with the construction of a 109-mile fence topped with razor wire.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout 50 police officers, wearing riot gear and equipped with gas canisters, converged Monday on the train tracks linking the villages of Roszke, Hungary, and Horgos, Serbia, which thousands of migrants had used to cross the border in recent days. An official in a bright yellow jacket turned away migrants seeking to enter Hungary.\n\nVideo\n\nThe border measures raised pressure on participants at the emergency meeting in Brussels to close the deep fissures that have opened up among European nations over how to handle the migrant crisis. A further note of urgency came with an appeal in Brussels made by the aunt of Aylan Kurdi, the 3-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed up on a beach in Turkey this month. Photographs of the dead child shocked European public opinion and helped set off an outpouring of sympathy for migrants.\n\n\u201cEurope has not done enough,\u201d the aunt, Tima Kurdi, a resident of Canada, said during a visit on Monday to Brussels for talks with officials. \u201cGermany took the biggest number, and now it has too many. Every country has to take responsibility. Aylan\u2019s death was, I believe, a message from God to the world to wake up and do something about these refugees. Everybody is closing the door in their face.\u201d\n\nAll the same, ministers from several East and Central European countries remained steadfast in their opposition to the compulsory distribution of migrants proposed last week by Mr. Juncker.\n\n\u201cThis proposal is not solving the problem,\u201d said Robert Kalinak, the Slovak interior minister. The Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and the Baltic States have all voiced deep reservations about taking in refugees, arguing that they have no tradition of offering refuge to people of different cultures; that their economies cannot sustain the influx; and that most of the migrants want to live in richer and more welcoming places like Germany and Scandinavia.\n\nIn a dig at former Communist countries in the East that have said they will take only Christian refugees, Mr. Asselborn, the Luxembourg minister who ran Monday\u2019s meeting, said that even his own country, the European Union\u2019s smallest, \u201ccould take in a few hundred people who are not necessarily Christians, who have a different skin color, and that should be able to work in big countries like Poland or the Czech Republic or in Slovakia.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to win over opponents of the plan, Germany, France and other nations embraced some of the Eastern Europeans\u2019 tough language, calling for tighter controls of Europe\u2019s external borders and firmer measures against migrants who fail to qualify as refugees, including their swift return to countries deemed safe.\n\nThe French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, stressed that economic migrants needed to be separated from genuine refugees fleeing war or oppression. \u201cThere cannot be humanity without firmness and responsibility,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nPhoto\n\nMinisters endorsed plans to increase cooperation against smuggling and border violations with Turkey, which has become one of the major transit countries for migrants making their way to Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday to the European Parliament, Mr. Juncker presented the migrant crisis as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to take common action and asked that interior ministers move swiftly to endorse his relocation plan at their Monday meeting. Voicing doubts that a voluntary program would work, he said, \u201cThis has to be done in a compulsory way.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission did not include the remark in an official transcript of the speech, in what could be a sign of the strength of opposition to this initiative.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It is time for each and every one to take their responsibilities,\u201d he added.", "summary": "The reintroduction of controls also threatened to create an unpredictable patchwork of complications and potentially risky obstacles for migrants seeking to make their way through Europe to preferred destinations in places like Germany or Sweden, where benefits are greater and the processing of asylum applications moves faster.About 50 police officers, wearing riot gear and equipped with gas canisters, converged Monday on the train tracks linking the villages of Roszke, Hungary, and Horgos, Serbia, which thousands of migrants had used to cross the border in recent days.The Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and the Baltic States have all voiced deep reservations about taking in refugees, arguing that they have no tradition of offering refuge to people of different cultures; that their economies cannot sustain the influx; and that most of the migrants want to live in richer and more welcoming places like Germany and Scandinavia.In an effort to win over opponents of the plan, Germany, France and other nations embraced some of the Eastern Europeans\u2019 tough language, calling for tighter controls of Europe\u2019s external borders and firmer measures against migrants who fail to qualify as refugees, including their swift return to countries deemed safe.In a speech on Wednesday to the European Parliament, Mr. Juncker presented the migrant crisis as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to take common action and asked that interior ministers move swiftly to endorse his relocation plan at their Monday meeting."}
