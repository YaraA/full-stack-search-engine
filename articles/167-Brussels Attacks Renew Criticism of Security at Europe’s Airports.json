{"title": "Brussels Attacks Renew Criticism of Security at Europe\u2019s Airports", "authors": ["Dan Bilefsky"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/world/europe/brussels-attacks-airport-security.html", "body": "\u201cThis is what I have heard from fellow police,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, one needs to be prudent and we are checking this out.\u201d\n\nMr. Gilles said there was a notable and worrying number of employees working at Brussels Airport in baggage handling and on the tarmac who had criminal records, but he did not provide an estimate.\n\nMany of the terrorists involved in the Brussels and Paris attacks have links to the poorer, immigrant parts in the Belgian capital, and Mr. Gilles appeared to draw a connection between those areas and the security of the airport. Mr. Gilles suggested that the recruitment policy employed by the Brussels Airport Company, which manages the facility, appeared to favor people from those areas.\n\nAnke Fransen, a Brussels Airport spokeswoman, said the company was aware of the various concerns raised by the police union but had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Brussels Airport Company said in a statement Thursday that it was \u201coperationally ready\u201d to reopen and that the Belgian Civil Aviation Authority had granted approval for a partial restart of passenger flights. The authorities had not made a formal decision on when they could resume, however, and there will be no flights before Friday evening, the statement said.\n\nConcerns about security and the potential risk of infiltration by radical groups has been a concern at airports around Europe. In the days after the attacks in France, the police raided about 4,000 employee lockers at Charles de Gaulle, Europe\u2019s second-largest airport, in search of evidence potentially linking staff to the attackers or other Islamist groups.\n\nVideo\n\nAccording to police and union officials, those searches yielded little more than a small cache of Qurans and other Islamic literature. (The searches led to the dismissal of about a dozen employees, who were found in possession of food or other goods stolen from airport vendors.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNonetheless, the airport\u2019s chief of police, Philippe Riffaut, has used the threat of terrorism to justify a review of the roughly 87,000 airport employees who have badges giving them access to secure areas that include the tarmac, baggage handling and cargo storage.\n\nThose badges, issued after a background check by the police, are normally renewed every three to five years. Since January 2015, the police said, the badges of more than 80 workers at Charles de Gaulle have been revoked for security reasons.\n\nIn Brussels, Mr. Gilles said that while traffic at the airport had increased tenfold over the past 15 years, his repeated requests to augment security had been ignored. He said that was because the federal police, who are responsible for the airport, saw it as unnecessary and failed to send the request up the chain of command to the Interior Ministry.\n\nMr. Gilles suggested that bureaucratic entropy and a lack of responsibility among the political class were undermining security at the airport.\n\nBelgium, a politically fragmented and linguistically divided country, has come under heavy criticism in recent days after a number of astonishing law enforcement and intelligence errors leading up to the deadly attacks at the airport and the Maelbeek subway station in Brussels.\n\nMr. Gilles accused the Brussels Airport Company of placing an excessive focus on economic considerations, and he said a request made in December to install a security check outside the entrance to airport terminal had been rebuffed.\n\nHe said he was told that such a checkpoint would be too expensive, and that company officials defended the decision by noting that no other airport in the European Union\u2019s open-border Schengen Area had such security measures.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

He said the police were enraged about the targeting of Brussels. \u201cThere is anger for not having prevented the attacks,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Many of the terrorists involved in the Brussels and Paris attacks have links to the poorer, immigrant parts in the Belgian capital, and Mr. Gilles appeared to draw a connection between those areas and the security of the airport.The Brussels Airport Company said in a statement Thursday that it was \u201coperationally ready\u201d to reopen and that the Belgian Civil Aviation Authority had granted approval for a partial restart of passenger flights.Belgium, a politically fragmented and linguistically divided country, has come under heavy criticism in recent days after a number of astonishing law enforcement and intelligence errors leading up to the deadly attacks at the airport and the Maelbeek subway station in Brussels.He said he was told that such a checkpoint would be too expensive, and that company officials defended the decision by noting that no other airport in the European Union\u2019s open-border Schengen Area had such security measures.In the open letter by the airport police, as reported on Thursday by Het Belang van Limburg, a Flemish newspaper, the officers said they were not satisfied with security."}
