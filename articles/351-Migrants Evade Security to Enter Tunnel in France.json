Three were killed in September.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nTrain drivers of the C.G.T. union wrote an open letter last week saying, \u201cToday, we are afraid. Afraid to start, afraid to finish, afraid to drive,\u201d as well as \u201cafraid to hit, smash, electrocute,\u201d according to The Associated Press. The letter, addressed to the French government, asked for a solution that does not involve the use of force.\n\n\u201cHitting a refugee with your train, seeing people die on the rails, is really something traumatizing,\u201d a C.G.T. spokesman, Herv\u00e9 Gomet, said Friday on France Info radio. He said the problem would not be solved by putting up barbed wire fences.\n\nThe British government has given more money and security fencing to go around the French side of the complex, which has a perimeter of 17 miles. There are more security and police officers at the site to prevent break-ins and illegal entries.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Most polls show a majority of Britons want to stay in the bloc, but those in favor of leaving are gaining ground, in part because of Europe\u2019s chaotic handling of the migrant crisis.", "summary": "Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
