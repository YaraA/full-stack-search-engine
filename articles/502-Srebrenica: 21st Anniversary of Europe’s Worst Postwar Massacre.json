The city had been designated a safe area by the United Nations and was being protected by Dutch troops. That evening, more than 20,000 residents fled the city, seeking refuge in and around the Dutch military compound in a former factory about three miles from the city. The next morning, Bosnian Serb forces separated the men and boys from the rest of the group and took them away to be killed. Ultimately, more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred in the worst mass killing in Europe since World War II. The New York Times sent a photographer to the ceremony marking the 21st anniversary."}
