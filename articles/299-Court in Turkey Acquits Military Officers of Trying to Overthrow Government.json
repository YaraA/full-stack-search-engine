The case came under heavy scrutiny from forensic and legal experts who asserted that evidence had been compromised and was being used by Turkey\u2019s Islamists to seek revenge on former oppressors in the military.\n\nLast year, the constitutional court ruled that mishandling of the evidence had violated the defendants\u2019 rights, which led to the suspects\u2019 release and retrial.\n\nOn Tuesday, the leading prosecutor in the retrial, Ramazan Oksuz, stated that the digital data in the file was not viable evidence. \u201cWe reached the conclusion that it is not possible to find any relation between the suspects and the digital data in question,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the government initially supported the case, officials now say that the evidence was manipulated by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. Mr. Gulen, a former ally who now opposes Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has a network of supporters with influence within the police and judiciary who are widely believed to have led the Sledgehammer prosecution.", "summary": "In 2012, the officers, accused of participating in a plot called Sledgehammer that aimed to overthrow the government in 2003, were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.The case came under heavy scrutiny from forensic and legal experts who asserted that evidence had been compromised and was being used by Turkey\u2019s Islamists to seek revenge on former oppressors in the military.Last year, the constitutional court ruled that mishandling of the evidence had violated the defendants\u2019 rights, which led to the suspects\u2019 release and retrial.On Tuesday, the leading prosecutor in the retrial, Ramazan Oksuz, stated that the digital data in the file was not viable evidence.Mr. Gulen, a former ally who now opposes Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has a network of supporters with influence within the police and judiciary who are widely believed to have led the Sledgehammer prosecution."}
