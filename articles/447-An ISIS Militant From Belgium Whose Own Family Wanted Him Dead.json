A safe house for militants he had helped set up in eastern Belgium was raided in January.\n\nThere, two of his comrades, including the brother of the inmate he had called, were killed. The Belgian authorities trumpeted the raid as having thwarted \u201ca major terrorist operation.\u201d\n\nBut it missed its principal target, Mr. Abaaoud, who then somehow made his way back to Syria, which Islamic State refers to by its historical Muslim name, \u201cSham.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllah blinded their vision and I was able to leave and come to Sham despite being chased by so many intelligence agencies,\u201d he later told Dabiq, a slickly produced magazine published by the Islamic State.\n\nIt is not known whether Mr. Abaaoud had any direct contact in Syria with Mr. Adnani, the architect of what the C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, on Monday called the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cexternal operations agenda.\u201d As a low-level fighter, Mr. Abaaoud was unlikely to have mixed with senior figures in the militant group\u2019s hierarchy, experts in Belgium said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the two men shared a passion for propaganda, with Mr. Adnani serving as the Islamic State\u2019s official spokesman and Mr. Abaaoud featured in various recruitment campaigns.\n\nMr. Abaaoud also had an invaluable asset for Islamic State leaders eager to take their battle to Europe \u2014 a pool of friends and contacts back home willing to carry out attacks.\n\nLike many of the jihadists who have carried out attacks in Europe, including the brothers who attacked the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January, Mr. Abaaoud showed far more interest in thievery and drugs when he was a young man than in Islam, particularly the highly disciplined, self-sacrificing Salafi strain favored by many militants.\n\nNor was his family impoverished. His father, Omar, owned a clothing store off the market square in Molenbeek, a borough of Brussels, and the family lived nearby in a spacious if shabby corner home on Rue de l\u2019Avenir \u2014 Future Street \u2014 near the local police station.\n\nDespite his subsequent denunciations of the mistreatment suffered by Muslims in Europe, he enjoyed privileges available to few immigrants, including admission to an exclusive Catholic school, Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Pierre d\u2019Uccle, in an upscale residential district of Brussels.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

An assistant to Saint-Pierre\u2019s director, who declined to give her name, said he had apparently flunked out. Others say he was dismissed for poor behavior.\n\nHe then drifted into a group of friends in Molenbeek who engaged in various petty crimes. Among his friends were Ibrahim and Salah Abdeslam, two brothers who, like Mr. Abaaoud, lived just a few blocks away and are now at the center of the investigation into the Paris attacks.\n\nIbrahim Abdeslam was one of the suicide bombers on Friday, and Salah Abdeslam, who rented a car in Brussels that was used to transport some of the gunmen in the attacks on Paris, is the target of an extensive manhunt.\n\nMr. Abaaoud was arrested for petty crime in 2010 and spent time in the same prison in Brussels where Ibrahim Abdeslam was being held, according to the spokesman for Belgium\u2019s federal prosecutor and Ibrahim\u2019s former lawyer. It is not known if they were in touch while in the prison, but they did not stay long. After their release, they returned to Molenbeek, often hanging out at a dingy bar known as a hangout for drug dealers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo the dismay of his family, which had not seen him show any religious zeal, Mr. Abaaoud suddenly moved to Syria in the beginning of 2014, according to jihadi experts tracking Belgian militants.\n\nSoon after his arrival in Syria, where he stayed for a time in a grand villa in Aleppo used to house French-speaking jihadists, he explained his choice in a video: \u201cAll my life I have seen the blood of Muslims flow. I pray that God breaks the backs of those who oppose him\u201d and \u201cthat he exterminates them,\u201d he said.\n\nEarly this year, the French magazine Paris Match found a film that showed Mr. Abaaoud grinning and making jokes as he dragged corpses with a pickup truck.\n\n\u201cI suddenly saw my picture all over the media,\u201d he told Dabiq. He added that \u201cthanks to Allah, the infidels were blinded by Allah\u201d and did not spot him when he returned to Europe at the end of last year.\n\nHe also somehow persuaded his younger brother, Younes, who was still in Molenbeek and only 13, to join him in Syria. The boy left Belgium for Syria on his own without raising any suspicion from the authorities.\n\nMr. Abaaoud\u2019s father joined a state prosecutor\u2019s case against his son in May for having recruited Younes.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d Omar Abaaoud told local reporters at the time. \u201cI am on medication,\u201d he said, adding that his son had dishonored the family. \u201cHe destroyed our families. I don\u2019t ever want to see him again.\u201d\n\nHis father is now living in Morocco and wants to put the property on Future Street up for sale, a family friend said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, Mr. Abaaoud is suspected of being a leader of a branch of the Islamic State in Syria called Katibat al-Battar al Libi, which has its origins in Libya. This particular branch has attracted many Belgian fighters because of language and cultural ties, said Pieter van Ostaeyen, who tracks Belgian militants.\n\nMany Belgian Muslims are of Moroccan origin, he said, and speak a dialect found in eastern Morocco that is similar to a Libyan dialect. Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, who studies jihadi groups at the Middle East Forum, a research center in Washington, said there was no evidence yet that the Paris attacks had been ordered by Mr. Adnani or the Islamic State\u2019s overall leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nBut he added that the soldiers at the Libyan branch that includes Mr. Abaaoud had played a prominent role in exporting violence. One of their tasks, he said, has been to organize plots that \u201cinvolved foreign fighters, sleeper cells in Europe that were connected with an operative inside of Syria and Iraq, usually in a lower to midlevel position.\u201d\n\nAbout 520 Belgian fighters have gone to Syria or Iraq to fight, making Belgium the biggest suspected source, per capita, of foreign fighters for ISIS. According to posts on Twitter and other social media accounts, the two men who were killed during the raid in Verviers, Belgium, in January were members of Katibat al-Battar.", "summary": "Western intelligence agencies, worried that the Islamic State was planning to widen its carnage from the Middle East to Europe, tried to track a slow but steady trickle of fighters in Syria as they headed home to the Continent.
