The central government was also poised to take charge of Catalonia\u2019s autonomous police force and the Catalan center for telecommunications.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Rajoy did not ask to dissolve the Catalan Parliament, but instead said that the president of the assembly would not be allowed to take any initiative judged to be contrary to Spain\u2019s Constitution for a period of 30 days, including trying to propose another leader to replace Mr. Puigdemont.\n\nMr. Rajoy said that his goal was to arrange new Catalan elections within six months, so as to lift the measures taken under Article 155 as soon as possible.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, how such elections would be organized or whether they would significantly change Catalonia\u2019s political landscape, let alone help to resolve the territorial conflict.\n\nMr. Puigdemont led a mass demonstration of 450,000 people in Barcelona, the region\u2019s capital, on Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn a televised address late Saturday, Mr. Puigdemont said he would convene Parliament next week to discuss the response to Mr. Rajoy; he did not rule out using the session to declare independence. He accused the Spanish government of trying to \u201celiminate our self-government and our democracy.\u201d\n\nIn a part of his speech delivered in English, Mr. Puigdemont also addressed Europe\u2019s politicians and citizens and suggested Europe\u2019s \u201cfoundational values are at risk\u201d in the dispute with Madrid. \u201cDemocratically deciding the future of a nation is not a crime,\u201d he argued.\n\nOther Catalan separatist politicians warned that Mr. Rajoy\u2019s announcement would escalate rather than resolve the conflict.\n\nJosep Llu\u00eds Cleries, a Catalan Senator, told reporters on Saturday that Mr. Rajoy was suspending not autonomy in Catalonia but democracy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCarme Forcadell, the separatist president of the Catalan Parliament, pledged on Saturday evening to defend \u201cthe sovereignty\u201d of her assembly. \u201cWe will not take a step back,\u201d she told a news conference. \u201cMr. Rajoy isn\u2019t conscious that by attacking the institutions, he is attacking the society of this country.\u201d", "summary": "But the current confrontation has presented a vexing quandary not only for Spain but the entire European Union, pitting demands for self-determination against the desire to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of an important member state.Mr. Rajoy took the bold steps with broad support from Spain\u2019s main political opposition, and will almost certainly receive the required approval next week from the Spanish Senate, where his own conservative party holds a majority.He did so despite repeated appeals for dialogue and mediation by the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, whose independence drive has been shunned by wary European Union officials.Mr. Rajoy did not ask to dissolve the Catalan Parliament, but instead said that the president of the assembly would not be allowed to take any initiative judged to be contrary to Spain\u2019s Constitution for a period of 30 days, including trying to propose another leader to replace Mr. Puigdemont.In a televised address late Saturday, Mr. Puigdemont said he would convene Parliament next week to discuss the response to Mr. Rajoy; he did not rule out using the session to declare independence."}
