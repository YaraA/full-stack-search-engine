Almost a year later, four refugee families moved into the re-renovated property. But no one was ever arrested for the fire.\n\nTracking anti-immigrant attacks is difficult, in part because of Germany\u2019s splintered federal system.

The mother and her three children, the only Africans in town, had arrived here in November 2014.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t imagine anyone doing this,\u201d Mr. Pommerening, 48, said in his tidy office in the town shopping center. \u201cBut now, of course, I can\u2019t exclude it. And if it can happen here, it can happen anywhere.\u201d\n\nHe takes comfort in the fact that some 2,000 people showed up for a pro-refugee rally the evening after the firebombing and about 120 refugees still live in the town.\n\nBefore the trial opened, Roman von Alvensleben, the main defense lawyer for Mr. L., said he hoped that the town would not be stigmatized for what he depicted as one night\u2019s drunken folly by three misguided people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMy client is really a person you can look at and think, he cannot have done it,\u201d he said.\n\nIn court, however, Ms. B., the driver, suggested that her two friends had acted consciously, even if they were drunk, though her own credibility was called into question.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Her frightened children always sleep with her now. She wept when shown pictures of her charred former home.\n\nAlthough Mr. Pommerening said a new apartment had been found for her and her children, the family moved this month to a larger nearby town, Hameln.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Tanja Brettschneider, a lawyer for Mr. L., said her client wanted to apologize and asked if Margaret would accept.\n\nThe victim paused, then said simply, \u201cMust I answer that?\u201d", "summary": "The first arson case to gain attention nationwide occurred in the northern Bavarian village of Vorra in December 2014, when someone set fire to a renovated shelter that was about to receive 40 refugees.But the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, a respected nongovernment source, compiles lists culled from news media and police reports nationwide.During the week of Jan. 24, for instance, it found 10 suspected racist or right-wing assaults, including an arson on Jan. 25 that damaged two houses intended for 25 asylum seekers in Witten, in North Rhine-Westphalia.Several witnesses testified that a favorite pastime for the two men was drinking heavily and listening to right-wing rock bands, including at least one, Landser, that was outlawed in 2003 for inciting hatred.Before the trial opened, Roman von Alvensleben, the main defense lawyer for Mr. L., said he hoped that the town would not be stigmatized for what he depicted as one night\u2019s drunken folly by three misguided people."}
