And not too comfortably.\n\nOn the one hand, Barcelona is a global city, a former host of the Olympics, and the home of one of the world\u2019s most famous soccer clubs, F.C. Barcelona. It is a magnet for more than 10 million visitors a year, an example of the ways large cities increasingly influence global politics, economics and culture.\n\nOn the other hand, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, Spain\u2019s restive northeastern region, and the nerve center of a drive for Catalan independence that is described by its opponents as parochial, exclusive and nationalist.\n\nIn that campaign \u2014 which the Spanish government now says it will take emergency measures to halt \u2014 there is no place in Catalonia with more at stake. In Barcelona, the issue of independence has provoked exceptionally sharp soul-searching and debate over allegiances and identity, with an intensity not seen since Britain voted to leave the European Union.\n\nIn short, people are worried. First among them is the city\u2019s leftist mayor, Ada Colau, who, despite expressing support for independence in the past, says she is now not in favor of leaving. \u201cIt\u2019s a very pluralistic city and there is a lot of diversity of opinions in Barcelona,\u201d she said in an interview this week.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe city is not exactly comparable to London \u2014 which favored remaining in the European Union \u2014 since Barcelona is still home to many separatists. \u201cBut if you compare it with people in the heart of Catalonia,\u201d Ms. Colau said, \u201cit\u2019s not as pro-independence.\u201d\n\nMs. Colau said she was appalled by the violence of the Spanish national police as they tried to block people from voting in the Oct. 1 independence referendum, and she believes in Catalonia\u2019s right to self-determination."}
