I think what it boils down to is relevance. Without change, I think that people are just going to give up going to church.\u201d\n\nA Bishop Sees Change\n\nArchbishop Joseph E. Kurtz, of Louisville, Ky., is the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and a social worker who has been in parish ministry.\n\n\u201cEvery aspect of church ministry is going to be affected,\u201d especially marriage preparation and support for couples once they are married, Archbishop Kurtz said in a telephone news conference.\n\nHe said he expected that the exhortation would have an effect on how seminarians are trained to work with families. Archbishop Kurtz said he thought Pope Francis\u2019 message to pastors was \u201cdon\u2019t forget to see people as unique,\u201d not simply as categories.\n\n\u201cThe teaching is not changing, he\u2019s not giving new regulations or new rules, but he is giving a mind-set in which we see the person first,\u201d the archbishop said.\n\nDisappointed in Francis\n\nWilliam Steinmetz, a divorced father of two children, said he had hoped for more from Francis. Specifically, he said, he wanted to hear that the church would \u201crecognize families as they actually exist in all their variations.\u201d\n\nMr. Steinmetz, 46, grew up in Pennsylvania and served as an altar boy in his local parish. He said he began to fall away from the church after his parents divorced, but was deeply committed to a spiritual life. He has been living with another man in a civil partnership in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, for more than 20 years, but said he did not feel very welcome in any Catholic parish.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen Francis became pope, I was very excited,\u201d he said. \u201cI had very high expectations, but I realize he wasn\u2019t as open as I thought he was.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This document continues to demonstrate a tragic ignorance. Many L.G.B.T. people and families have offered to share their experience with church officials, and often get a deaf ear.\u201d\n\n\u2018An Attitude That Every Pastor Should Have\u2019\n\nThe Rev. Paul Huesing is pastor of Old St. Mary\u2019s Catholic Church in Chicago, and a member of the Paulist religious order. His congregation is ethnically diverse, with a lot of young families.\n\nFor the last 35 years as a priest, he said, he has been using the approach Francis suggests in the document. He encourages people who have remarried outside the church to examine their own conscience regarding whether to take communion.\n\n\u201cThe notion is that there\u2019s a prayerful, reflective process going on,\u201d Father Huesing said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, \u2018Oh I want to go to Communion again.\u2019 You take the teachings to heart, and evaluate your marriage in light of those teachings, and make an informed decision.\u201d\n\nHe said that this approach was \u201cvery common\u201d among priests, but that \u201cit varies widely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the Holy Father is affirming a very pastoral and loving attitude that every pastor should have,\u201d Father Huesing said.\n\n\u2018I Don\u2019t Think It\u2019s Going to Work\u2019\n\nBarbara Falls raised eight children, now all grown, in Old Town, Me., never used contraception and attends Mass every Sunday. She said she really appreciated the passages in the document that call the church to work harder at preventing couples from divorcing, because in her experience marriages can be saved.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re liberal, conservative, Catholic or atheist, keeping families together is really important,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs. Falls, who considers herself an orthodox Catholic, says she thinks that Francis is \u201ctrying to get people back to the church, so he\u2019s trying to make it like we\u2019re inclusive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think people are interested in going. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work.\u201d\n\nShe said she knows people who are divorced, use contraception or have had abortions, and they already go to church and take communion with little hesitation \u2014 so Francis\u2019 effort to welcome them back is unlikely to make much difference. \u201cIf you want to go to church, you\u2019ll go to church.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Really Good Middle Line\u2019\n\nLuke Arredondo, a Ph.D. student in religion at Florida State University in Tallahassee, attends Mass weekly with his wife and three young daughters. He is partway through reading the exhortation and said he found it \u201cgenius\u201d that Francis seemed to be allowing bishops and priests in different countries to \u201clocalize specific pastoral initiatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Francis walked a really good middle line,\u201d Mr. Arredondo said. \u201cFrancis gets painted as sort of this crazy guy who you never know what he\u2019s going to do. And certainly that\u2019s true in his airplane interviews. But in his more thought-out moments, he\u2019s pretty middle-of-the-road.\u201d"}
