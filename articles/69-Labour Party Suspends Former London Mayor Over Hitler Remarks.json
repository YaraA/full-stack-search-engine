When he was not selected by Labour to run for the London mayoral elections in 2000, he entered as an independent and won \u2014 though when he was re-elected in 2004, it was as the official Labour Party candidate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2005, Mr. Livingstone was investigated for likening a Jewish reporter to a Nazi concentration camp guard. Last year he provoked criticism when he said that a Labour lawmaker, Kevan Jones, who has depression, \u201cmight need some psychiatric help\u201d \u2014 though he eventually apologized for the comment.\n\nAmong those who had called for disciplinary action against Mr. Livingstone over his latest remarks was Sadiq Khan, a former Labour government minister who hopes next week to be the first Muslim to be elected mayor of London.\n\nIn a statement, the Labour Party said that Mr. Livingstone had been suspended \u201cpending an investigation, for bringing the party into disrepute.\u201d It also added that Mr. Mann \u2014 the lawmaker who confronted Mr. Livingstone \u2014 had been summoned by the chief whip, who is responsible for parliamentary discipline, \u201cto discuss his conduct.\u201d\n\nMr. Corbyn also told reporters that the Labour Party was \u201cnot tolerating anti-Semitism in any form whatsoever in our party.\u201d\n\nYet the recent episodes may weaken Mr. Corbyn, who is at odds with many of his own lawmakers. A clear majority of them did not want him to be their leader despite his winning an overwhelming mandate from party members and supporters last year.\n\nMr. Livingstone is one of relatively few experienced political figures upon whom Mr. Corbyn can rely for support on issues that put him at odds with many of his lawmakers, such as his opposition to nuclear weapons.\n\nThe rift also exposed political divisions within the opposition ranks, as one of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s critics attacked him for taking action against Mr. Mann, as well as Mr. Livingstone.\n\nMichael Dugher, who was fired this year by Mr. Corbyn as Labour\u2019s spokesman for culture, media and sport, supported Mr. Mann on Twitter, saying: \u201cWhat on earth has happened to the Labour Party?\u201d", "summary": "Later on Thursday, Mr. Livingstone was confronted by John Mann, a Labour lawmaker, who in a series of angry exchanges filmed outside a television studio described him as a \u201cdisgusting Nazi apologist\u201d and accused him of \u201crewriting history.\u201d Among those who had called for disciplinary action against Mr. Livingstone over his latest remarks was Sadiq Khan, a former Labour government minister who hopes next week to be the first Muslim to be elected mayor of London.
