There is no doubt the French police acted bravely. A seamlessly choreographed response by any police force may well have been impossible.\n\nStill, several French police experts, and a look at the chronology, suggest that the delayed response points to weaknesses in the highly centralized French police structure. A greater local police presence might have limited the killing, several experts said.\n\n\u201cWe have a big machine, and a relatively heavy one,\u201d said Christian Mouhanna, the leader of a unit focused on law and order at the National Center for Scientific Research, one of France\u2019s main research institutions.\n\n\u201cBy the time the information gets out and reaches up, mobilizing the specialized units takes a relatively long time,\u201d Mr. Mouhanna said. \u201cOur police are not organized along local lines. Everything has to filter up to the central organization at the prefecture.\u201d\n\nA colleague of his, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vy, a police expert, said the response raised the question of whether that system needs to be changed. As with the deadly assault on the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper, terrorists eluded the authorities in the heart of Paris after nimble and deadly attacks.\n\n\u201cIt made me think about the strategy, which is that one does nothing and one waits for the arrival of the specialists,\u201d Mr. L\u00e9vy said. \u201cMaybe there is something to think about, because in fact, ordinary police might have limited the damage.\u201d\n\nBut the local police \u2014 officers patrolling a beat by foot \u2014 essentially do not exist in France. An attempt at \u201cneighborhood police\u201d in the late 1990s was unpopular with the police unions and was stopped once political power shifted to the right a few years later.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe have a police force that is disconnected from the terrain,\u201d Mr. Mouhanna said.\n\nThat disconnect was a decided disadvantage with so much shooting and bombing happening at so many locations at once, leaving the cartography of the November attacks unclear for critical stretches for a force under centralized command.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeyond the Bataclan, the Paris police faced attacks that played out quickly across miles and threatened President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who was at the soccer stadium where two suicide bombers blew themselves up. Scores were wounded, overwhelming hospitals.\n\nSo great was the confusion that the specialized antiterrorism unit \u2014 the Search and Intervention Brigade, known by its French initials, B.R.I. \u2014 initially headed toward restaurants on Rue de Charonne where the killing had ended more than 20 minutes before, according to the French news media. By then, the terrorists were long gone.\n\nIt then took half an hour for the B.R.I. to reach the Bataclan. They arrived at about 10:15 p.m., by which time the slaughter on the concert-hall floor was over, according to police statements in the French news media.\n\n\u201cRight there, we skidded,\u201d the B.R.I.\u2019s chief, Christophe Molmy, told the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, acknowledging the mistake.\n\nAnother two hours passed before the B.R.I. ended the siege at the Bataclan, storming an upstairs room where the terrorists had taken refuge behind a group of terrified hostages.\n\nOther experts emphasized the importance of speed. \u201cYour job is to reduce the time on target, which is how long is that person in there, actively engaged in killing, before you can get in there and stop it,\u201d said John J. Miller, the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence at the New York Police Department.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, an independent federal commission found that the response of the police and fire departments had been undermined by poor planning, inadequate equipment, faulty communication and generations-old interagency rivalries.\n\nThe Paris police prefecture, which oversees all police units in the city under the Interior Ministry, declined to make officers available for interviews, as did the Interior Ministry and a leading police union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut several officers spoke on television and in newspapers in the days immediately after the attacks. Their graphic accounts of the Bataclan siege underscored the horror of what they had found. \u201cIt was an incredible scene,\u201d Mr. Molmy told the Figaro newspaper.\n\nBut the accounts also speak to the segmented nature of French policing.\n\nThe downside of France\u2019s system of deploying specialized units like the B.R.I. is that \u201cthe beat officers are not highly trained, and so you\u2019ve got to wait for the specialists to arrive,\u201d Mr. Mouhanna, of the research institute, said.\n\n\u201cThere is a question of quickness of reaction,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have a lot of officers in offices. On the ground, we don\u2019t have that many.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first police officer to penetrate the Bataclan was a member of the Brigade Anti-Criminalit\u00e9, an anti-crime unit known as the BAC: a quasi-local officer whose unit would have been assigned to patrol the area by vehicle. There are few such night patrols in Paris, experts said.\n\nIn an interview on French television that was posted online, a man said to be the officer, unidentified and his face blurred, recalled a scene of \u201cindescribable horror.\u201d \u201cWe open the door, nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was surreal. Hundreds of bodies stretched out everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe officer described seeing one of the terrorists on the left of the stage, taking aim at a group of hostages, hands on heads, \u201cwho were walking toward him very calmly, very dignified, but who seemed totally resigned to their fate.\u201d\n\nQuickly, the officer fired, he said, and there was an explosion. He had hit the terrorist\u2019s suicide belt. At that point, the killing stopped, and the remaining two terrorists retreated to the floor above, grabbing hostages.\n\nSome 15 minutes later, Mr. Molmy arrived at the Bataclan with his men from the B.R.I.\n\n\u201cIt was absolute silence,\u201d Mr. Molmy said in an interview with AFPTV posted online. \u201cEven those who were still alive didn\u2019t dare move.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo one knew where the terrorists were. It was dark, and the ground floor of the concert hall was carpeted with bodies. It would take another two hours to end the terrorist attack and retrieve all the wounded.\n\n\u201cWe were freeing hostages continuously,\u201d Mr. Molmy told a television interviewer. \u201cEach time somebody came toward us, we had to make sure they were not wearing a suicide belt.\u201d But there were no more gunshots.\n\nAbout an hour after arriving, Mr. Molmy\u2019s force divided into two thin columns. They were proceeding along a narrow corridor when they finally heard a voice: a hostage, shouting from behind a door, who was being made to serve as the spokesman for the two remaining terrorists.\n\nHurried exchanges with the terrorists followed over a cellphone for about an hour.\n\n\u201cThey were very nervous,\u201d Mr. Molmy told a television interviewer. The attackers threatened to decapitate the hostages and spoke of the caliphate sought by the Islamic State extremist group. \u201cAt 12:18, we understood that we had to get on with it, because they had become extremely nervous and were threatening to blow themselves up,\u201d Mr. Molmy said.\n\nThe first B.R.I. column opened the door, protected by a 176-pound shield. \u201cWe found ourselves in a corridor, faced by about 20 terrified hostages, and behind them, the terrorists,\u201d Mr. Molmy said. The terrorists opened fire immediately.\n\nThe shield sustained dozens of bullet impacts. Then it slipped from the hands of the officers, leaving them exposed.\n\nAt that moment, one of them shot at a shadow, hitting the suicide vest of an attacker and causing it to explode. A second explosion quickly followed when the other terrorist detonated his own vest. The assault was over, and to the wonder of the officers, none of the hostages had been killed.\n\n\u201cThis scenario, certainly, was a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Mouhanna said. \u201cVery, very difficult to manage.\u201d", "summary": "That disconnect was a decided disadvantage with so much shooting and bombing happening at so many locations at once, leaving the cartography of the November attacks unclear for critical stretches for a force under centralized command.
