{"title": "Without Britain, European Leaders Chart a Rocky New Course", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/world/europe/brexit-european-union.html", "body": "Ms. Merkel, like Mr. Renzi and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, faces immediate challenges that make decisive action even more difficult than it has been for the last several years in the face of Europe\u2019s economic, migration and border crises.\n\nFor Ms. Merkel, those challenges include terrorist assaults at home last month that have helped fuel support for a far-right party in elections in her political home state and added to her vulnerability over her refugee policy. That is in addition to a failed coup in Turkey and worsening conflict in Ukraine and Syria.\n\nMr. Hollande is entering spring presidential elections with record-low approval ratings, a sluggish economy and his nation in a skittish mood after a series of terrorist attacks. He is facing potential challenges even from within his own party, in addition to those from conservatives and the far right under Marine Le Pen.\n\nOn Monday, former President Nicolas Sarkozy formally announced that he would run to again be the standard-bearer for the center-right Republicans party, though when he left office four years ago, he too was deeply unpopular.\n\nItaly recorded zero growth in the second quarter this year. Mr. Renzi has staked his political future on a November referendum on constitutional changes. Defeat could mean early elections.\n\n\u201cAlthough in different ways, all three are weak leaders facing internal difficulties, with more or less imminent electoral tests, and therefore with narrow margins to maneuver,\u201d wrote Adriana Cerretelli in an editorial on Sunday in the Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore. She nonetheless called for \u201cimagination, political courage and strategic vision to lift Europe out of the ford in which it has been mired for years.\u201d\n\nYet the three leaders themselves remain divided on critical issues, not least whether to allow flexibility on stiff budget requirements for the 19 eurozone countries that Ms. Merkel insists are necessary and that Mr. Renzi, especially, blames for stunting economic growth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAllowing some leeway might bolster Mr. Hollande and Mr. Renzi politically, but it would be further proof of the European Union\u2019s inability to stick to its own rules.\n\nJan Techau, a German analyst who is the chairman of Carnegie Europe in Brussels, cast doubt on whether any progress could be made on the issue.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the timing and direction are completely open, and completely disputed.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel faces national elections in the fall of 2017, and it is unlikely that a euro overhaul will be achieved before then, Mr. Techau noted. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to get rushed into anything before elections next year.\u201d\n\nAs a leading German newspaper, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, put it, \u201cOver the next month, Europe will embark on a quest for meaning.\u201d\n\nThe talks on Monday are supposed to culminate in mid-September in a meeting of the 27 nations that will remain in the bloc. The three top leaders have promised new efforts on internal and external security; fresh stimulus for growth and jobs; and special programs for Europe\u2019s youth, who are bearing the brunt of unemployment almost everywhere but Germany.\n\nThere is no clear indication of how or why these efforts would succeed where others have failed. Yet the pressure is immense; if Europe cannot rally to its many challenges, anti-European Union feelings could lead to even more referendums.\n\nThe Netherlands, which already voted against a Europe-wide agreement on Ukraine in a referendum this summer, \u201care a very nervous European partner at the moment,\u201d Mr. Techau said.\n\nOther factors gnawing at Europe\u2019s fragile unity include the rerun presidential election scheduled for Oct. 2 in Austria, where a far-right politician could win in the first such triumph in Europe since 1945.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Merkel will spend the rest of the week crisscrossing central and Eastern Europe and then hosting Western European conservative leaders at a castle outside Berlin to try to forge new unity. Mr. Hollande and Mr. Renzi are likely to reach out to politicians in Portugal, Spain and Greece to unite the Continent\u2019s southern flank.\n\nOne important task is working out a mandate for Michel Barnier, a veteran politician from France, to negotiate with the British on behalf of the European Union.\n\nNo one knows when negotiations on Britain\u2019s departure will begin. Prime Minister Theresa May has hinted that London might not activate the relevant clause \u2014 known as Article 50 \u2014 until late this year, or even early in 2017. The complex separation will then have to be negotiated within two years.\n\nIn Ms. Merkel\u2019s view, that ball is very much in Britain\u2019s court. In contrast to the many meetings planned with European leaders this week, the only place she will run into a leading Briton is at a celebration in Germany\u2019s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, where Britain will be represented by Prince William, who, like other members of the royal family, has no say in politics.\n\n\u201cWe are not conducting any prenegotiations with the British, Ms. Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday. \u201cIt is up to them to tell us\u201d when the clock starts ticking on Britain\u2019s membership, he said, which for now remains, \u201cwith all the advantages \u2014 and all the obligations.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cAlthough in different ways, all three are weak leaders facing internal difficulties, with more or less imminent electoral tests, and therefore with narrow margins to maneuver,\u201d wrote Adriana Cerretelli in an editorial on Sunday in the Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore.
