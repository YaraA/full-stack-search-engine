Russian equipment, resupply, training flows back and forth freely.\u201d\n\nThough the Kremlin has denied that it has sent forces into Ukraine, General Breedlove said about 250 to 300 Russian soldiers are still in the country.\n\n\u201cThese are not fighting formations,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are formations and specialists who are in there doing training and equipping of the separatist forces.\u201d\n\nAnd as the Sunday vote approached, he reported, some Russian military units edged closer to Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine, an intimidating move that appeared intended to caution the Ukrainian government not to intervene.\n\n\u201cSome of those formations have moved closer to the border,\u201d General Breedlove said. \u201cWe believe that was probably to bring some pressure on and make sure that the elections went according to the separatists\u2019 plans.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, in another show of force, a column of about 60 unmarked military trucks drove through Donetsk.\n\nIn total, Russia has seven battalions near Ukraine, down from the 18 battalions \u2014 about 20,000 troops \u2014 it had there in August. But the forces are enough to maintain Russia\u2019s influence in the area and to buttress Moscow\u2019s efforts to help the separatists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Monday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported that pro-Russian fighters had fired on one of its surveillance drones the day before as it was filming pro-Russian forces on the move near a Ukrainian checkpoint. \u201cNew drones under fire east of the contact line,\u201d the group said in a post on Twitter.\n\nThe organization issued a statement saying the drone was flying at an altitude of about 5,000 feet near Mariupol, in the south of the Donetsk region, on the pro-Russian side of the front. It was filming a civilian truck when \u201ca canvas covering on the back of the truck was removed, revealing a truck-mounted antiaircraft gun, which immediately fired numerous rounds\u201d at the drone but missed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Putin, has said he does not want a crystallization of the status quo into a frozen conflict, but the Russian Foreign Ministry nevertheless issued a statement saying it would respect the outcome of separatist elections.\n\nRussia \u201crespects the choice made by residents of the southeast\u201d of Ukraine, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Grigory Karasin, later told the Interfax news agency.\n\n\u201cOur position is that the elected representatives of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions thereby received a mandate to hold negotiations with the central Ukrainian authorities and, acting as part of their political dialogue, tackle all the problems that have accumulated over many months,\u201d Mr. Karasin said.\n\nThe ministry statement stopped short of recognizing the outcome of the vote, but still drew a din of criticism from European officials.\n\nSteffen Seibert, the spokesman for Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, told reporters in Berlin that it was \u201cincomprehensible that there are official Russian voices that are respecting or even recognizing these so-called elections.\u201d\n\nThe turn of events in the rebellious territories ruled out any early lifting of European sanctions imposed on Russia and could lead to further sanctions if security deteriorated, Mr. Seibert said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said in a statement, \u201cI consider today\u2019s \u2018presidential and parliamentary elections\u2019 in Donetsk and Luhansk \u2018People\u2019s Republics\u2019 a new obstacle on the path toward peace.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian government has refused to negotiate directly with the rebel leadership outside of the O.S.C.E.-brokered cease-fire talks that include European and Russian officials, and it calls the separatist leadership \u201cterrorists.\u201d President Petro O. Poroshenko described Sunday\u2019s elections as a farce.\n\nThe rebel central election committee in Donetsk said Aleksandr Zakharchenko, a former electrician, had won the election with about 78 percent of the vote. Mr. Zakharchenko commanded a pro-Russian militia, Oplot, until August, when the Donetsk Supreme Soviet elevated him to prime minister, replacing a Russian citizen in a leadership shuffle intended to put a local face on the movement. Mr. Zakharchenko is a Russian-speaking ethnic Ukrainian.\n\nIn Luhansk, election officials said Igor Plotnitsky, a former public health inspector, had won with about 63 percent of the vote. The elections in both regions offered few plausible alternatives, and separatist officials said the purpose of the voting was to legitimize the leadership and compel Kiev to negotiate with them."}
