Although she still lives with her husband, who also survived the Holocaust, every time he tries to leave their home she starts to scream, \u201cDon\u2019t go! They will take you away, they will get you!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is living in a world where the Nazis are still there,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.\n\nIn response to a congressional letter written to Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble in December, Jens Spahn, a deputy minister who is leading the negotiations on behalf of the German government, said his country recognized that current levels of care were \u201cinsufficient for those in need of intensive long-term care.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome survivors require more extensive care, in some cases full-time care,\u201d Mr. Spahn wrote in the letter.\n\nGermany has made payments worth more than 73.4 billion euros, about $83 billion, in reparations and compensation, mostly to Jewish victims of the Nazis. The assistance to aging survivors is only a small part of these contributions.\n\n\u201cMany of my constituents are in their 80s, 90s, even 100, and our focus is ensuring that their needs can be provided for,\u201d Mr. Deutch said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to help survivors since coming to Congress six years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we acknowledge that what is being done by the Germans is incredibly generous, survivors\u2019 needs are not being met.\u201d", "summary": "The current round of talks, which opened in January and is scheduled to end by June, is trying to find a way to meet those needs, said Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the Claims Conference.
