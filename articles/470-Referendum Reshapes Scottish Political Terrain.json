Instead, it electrified politics here.\n\nDespite the referendum defeat and the resignation of its leader, Alex Salmond, the Scottish National Party has seen a huge increase in membership, to nearly 110,000 people, becoming the third-largest party in Britain, and it has managed to win and retain the support of those, including many Labour voters, who wanted independence.\n\nThe reason, Ms. Black said, is simple: Scots believe that the Labour Party has betrayed its working-class roots and become \u201cred Tories,\u201d little different than the Conservative Party.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe new Scottish National Party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, 44, who represents a nearby Glasgow constituency in the Scottish Parliament, has impressed Britons with her fluency and drive, while appearing less abrasive and defensive than Mr. Salmond. Some think she has outshone both Mr. Miliband and Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative, in televised debates, arguing against \u201causterity\u201d and demanding more taxes on the wealthy.\n\nMr. Alexander, 47, who grew up here, has a good local reputation, and five years ago won the seat with 59.6 percent of the vote. He has represented the area in Parliament since 1997. But his situation is a metaphor for the rapid evolution of politics in Scotland, which one Labour member of Parliament likened to being caught, helpless, in a tsunami.\n\nThe local Labour Party is very anxious. Mark Macmillan, the leader of the Labour-run Renfrewshire Council, said as he canvassed here: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very tight.\u201d\n\nPaisley, once famous for its weaving and thread industries (the Paisley pattern, for instance) and its radical politics in the early 19th century, is now much poorer. The old industries are gone, the huge Anchor Mills has been turned into apartments, and while there are start-ups, much of the city\u2019s employment is in public services.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPaisley has always been seen as a bellwether,\u201d Mr. Macmillan said. \u201cThe current condition of the Scottish Labour Party is not great,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut locally Douglas is popular and well-known. It\u2019s close, but it\u2019s winnable.\u201d\n\nThere are lots of local issues, from unemployment to the long waiting times at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, for which he blames the S.N.P.-led Scottish government. Labour promises more nurses for Scotland funded by increased taxation of the wealthy in southeastern England, and financial help for young people who do not go to college.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Miliband would need a rousing socialist campaign in Scotland to compete with Ms. Sturgeon, while at the same time, he must show the voters of England \u2014 85 percent of the British electorate \u2014 that Labour is fiscally responsible.\n\nHis dilemma was on display Thursday night in a nationally televised debate among opposition party leaders, when Ms. Sturgeon pressed him sharply to commit to an after-election parliamentary coalition with the Scottish National Party in order to \u201clock David Cameron out of Downing Street.\u201d\n\nMr. Miliband, looking uncomfortable, refused, emphasizing his \u201cfundamental disagreements\u201d with the S.N.P. over Scottish independence and Britain\u2019s submarine-based nuclear deterrent. He attacked her for wanting the Tories out, but trying to undermine Labour everywhere, making a Tory victory more possible.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn downtown Paisley, where the 12th-century abbey contrasts with empty storefronts on the main street, Margaret Flanagan said: \u201cI used to vote Labour, and my mother and father always voted Labour.\u201d\n\nMrs. Flanagan, 75, added: \u201cLabour\u2019s as bad as the Tories. They\u2019ve gone as conservative as the Tories. The S.N.P., they\u2019re more working-class.\u201d She had a telephone call from the Alexander campaign in which, she said, she told the caller that she was undecided.\n\nSteven Bowie, an engineer who lives in what the pollsters consider an \u201caspiring working-class\u201d neighborhood of neat homes, told Labour canvassers that he was undecided, and he seemed genuinely so. He voted for Labour last time but said he was wavering.\n\nStephen Campbell, 22, voted for independence but thinks that neither Labour nor the Scottish National Party is being fully honest. \u201cThe S.N.P. is not fully coming out and saying what are their goals in Westminster,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Labour?\u201d he sighed. \u201cThey\u2019re not really speaking to me, they seem to be speaking to England.\u201d\n\nMs. Black, who calls herself \u201ca political geek,\u201d spent the last two years campaigning for independence. The referendum last September reinforced her love of politics. \u201cIt forced people to stop and think of the future,\u201d she said.\n\nIf she wins on May 7, she says, she will go to London, push for change, find a good committee.\n\nIf she loses, Ms. Black said, \u201cI\u2019ll get some sleep.\u201d Then she paused. \u201cAnd then I\u2019d better start revising for my politics exam.\u201d", "summary": "Some think she has outshone both Mr. Miliband and Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative, in televised debates, arguing against \u201causterity\u201d and demanding more taxes on the wealthy.There are lots of local issues, from unemployment to the long waiting times at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, for which he blames the S.N.P.-led Scottish government.Labour promises more nurses for Scotland funded by increased taxation of the wealthy in southeastern England, and financial help for young people who do not go to college.Mr. Miliband would need a rousing socialist campaign in Scotland to compete with Ms. Sturgeon, while at the same time, he must show the voters of England \u2014 85 percent of the British electorate \u2014 that Labour is fiscally responsible.Steven Bowie, an engineer who lives in what the pollsters consider an \u201caspiring working-class\u201d neighborhood of neat homes, told Labour canvassers that he was undecided, and he seemed genuinely so."}
