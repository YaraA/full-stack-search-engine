{"title": "Germany Cracks Down on Salafists to Shield Refugees", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/world/europe/germany-salafists-refugees.html", "body": "With so many refugees from Muslim nations struggling to build a new life in Germany, officials fear the newcomers may be exceptionally vulnerable to appeals from Salafist groups. The concern has prompted the authorities to step up their efforts to prevent recruitment, and to take aim at groups and preachers who send young followers to jihad.\n\nOne of those preachers, the German authorities assert, is a 32-year-old Iraqi who goes by the name Abu Walaa and whom the authorities arrested on Nov. 8.\n\nBetter known as \u201cthe man with no face,\u201d because he often preached in Arabic and in poor German with his back to the camera, he was identified by officials only as Ahmed Abdulaziz A. He made his base in Hildesheim, an outwardly tranquil city of 100,000 south of Hanover, drawing an increasingly devoted following and even offering his own app in 2014.\n\nHe is said to have sent at least one person to jihad, and was charged with recruiting for terrorism and openly supporting the Islamic State.\n\nWith two or three wives, he split his time between Hildesheim and areas in Germany\u2019s largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, whose interior minister, Ralf J\u00e4ger, labeled the Iraqi as the \u201cchief ideologist\u201d of Salafists in Germany.\n\nAbu Walaa\u2019s arrest presaged a wider sweep. The police raided 190 sites around Germany as they banned a Salafist group called True Religion, which the authorities described as a \u201ccollecting pool\u201d for potential jihadists.\n\nUnder the guidance of a Palestinian preacher, Ibrahim Abou-Nagie, the group ran a campaign called \u201cRead!\u201d as it distributed free Qurans, often in pedestrian shopping zones. The authorities said the group had sent more than 140 people to jihadist battlefields.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are going to pull the rug out from under them,\u201d Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, the German interior minister, said after the raids, which were billed as the largest anti-Islamist operation in 15 years.\n\nPhoto\n\nPoliticians and officials stress that such activity affects a tiny percentage of refugees, and that Salafism has attracted only a small fraction of Germany\u2019s estimated five million Muslims. Today, the Salafists are said to number about 9,200 nationwide, a total that has almost tripled in the past five years.\n\nIf the potential threat posed by the Salafist movement is not new, what is new is a political climate that has grown increasingly anti-immigrant since the chaotic arrival in Germany of nearly a million refugees last year.\n\nAfter migrants were blamed for scores of sexual assaults during New Year\u2019s celebrations in Cologne, followed by a string of lone terrorist attacks linked to the Islamic State, the authorities say they can take no chances. In addition to making the recent arrests, they have begun increasing funding to hire new personnel and to add video surveillance in many public areas.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the measures are also an attempt to blunt criticism that officials have been flat-footed and failed to anticipate problems left by the refugees in their wake.\n\nThe alleged security lapses have been especially highlighted by an intriguing case, now before a judge, of a teenage girl from Hanover who stabbed and seriously wounded a police officer during a routine identity check at a Hanover train station in February.\n\nOpposition politicians in Lower Saxony say the authorities missed several clues that the girl, now 16 and identified only as Safia S. under German law, had long veered toward jihad. As early as 2009, Safia was seen in a video being paraded with pride by a leading German Salafist convert, Pierre Vogel, as a fine example of a young girl determined to wear the head scarf and live a devout life.\n\nShe was also seen at Quran distribution stands in Hanover. So were her brother, an Afghan who has since disappeared, and a young Muslim suspected of links to a thwarted terror attack that led the authorities a year ago to call off a national soccer match with the Netherlands, even as the stadium in Hanover was filling with fans.\n\nMore clues to Safia\u2019s radicalization may emerge during her trial, which is closed to the public under youth protection laws. But already it seems clear that she had run off to Turkey in January, apparently intending to reach Syria. Her Moroccan mother, who is said to be extremely religious, traveled to Turkey to bring her back to Germany.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe police observed the return but later classified Safia as no risk to public security, said Stefan Birkner, an opposition lawmaker in Lower Saxony who sits on committees investigating and overseeing police and intelligence work in the state.\n\nIn a video recorded a day before she assaulted the police officer, opposition lawmakers said, Safia dedicated her act to the Islamic State. Her lawyer, Mutlu G\u00fcnal, could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe authorities now consider the stabbing, which took place several months before two assailants wounded several people in separate attacks in Bavaria, to be the first Islamic State attack in Germany.\n\nMr. Pistorius, the interior minister of Lower Saxony, has vigorously denied that officials were slow to act on the girl\u2019s case. But opposition politicians say the authorities missed the signals of her extremism simply because she was so young.\n\nJens Nacke of the Christian Democrats quoted a police officer as saying, \u201cWe were looking for bearded 26-year-old men, and they use a 15-year-old teenager.\u201d\n\nAnother lawmaker, Mr. Birkner, said, \u201cIt has shown us that we must imagine everything.\u201d"}
