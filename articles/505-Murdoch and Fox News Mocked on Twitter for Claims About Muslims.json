They\u2019re sort of amorphous, they\u2019re not contiguous necessarily, but they\u2019re sort of safe havens and they\u2019re places where the governments like France, Britain, Sweden, Germany don\u2019t exercise any sovereignty. So you basically have zones where Shariah courts were set up, where Muslim density is very intense, where the police don\u2019t go in, and where it\u2019s basically a separate country almost, a country within a country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough Ms. Pirro, a former prosecutor and judge, made no effort to correct Mr. Emerson, he did eventually retract and apologize for his false claims, after enduring about 22 hours of online mockery from Britons who shared a series of absurd falsehoods about their nation tagged #FoxNewsFacts."}
