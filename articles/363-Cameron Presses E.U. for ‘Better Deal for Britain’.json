{"title": "Cameron Presses E.U. for \u2018Better Deal for Britain\u2019", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/world/europe/british-prime-minister-david-cameron-in-european-union-talks.html", "body": "While little is expected now except conversation, Mr. Cameron will ask Britons by the end of 2017, \u201cShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?\u201d Before that, he wants concessions, including a treaty change that he is unlikely to get before a referendum, since it would involve approval by all 28 governments, some requiring their own referendums.\n\nMr. Cameron says he wants change in four broad areas. He wants to restrict the right of legal European Union migrants to claim social welfare benefits and require them to wait up to four years to claim benefits for those with jobs. He wants to ensure that countries that do not use the euro, like Britain, cannot be hurt by rules made to govern the eurozone, to protect free trade in goods and financial services. He wants Britain excluded from its treaty obligation to seek an \u201cever closer union,\u201d and he wants Brussels to return some powers to national parliaments.\n\nFurther, though not a European Union issue, Mr. Cameron wants a British bill of rights, which could involve opting out of the European Convention on Human Rights, much as he has already decided not to accept Brussels-mandated quotas for migrants rescued at sea.\n\nThe British desire to limit migration has already led \u201cmany on the Continent to view Britain as a nasty country,\u201d said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform here. \u201cThe worse Britain\u2019s reputation, the less likely are other governments,\u201d with their own domestic politics, \u201cto give Cameron what he wants,\u201d he said.\n\nThat may be especially true in Poland, which may agree with Mr. Cameron about Brussels but has felt insulted by him over immigration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Even Mr. Cameron\u2019s new adviser on Europe, Mats Persson, said last month, before leaving the Open Europe research institution, that \u201cthe biggest risk is that an early vote would leave too little time for sweeping E.U. reform to be negotiated, potentially wasting a huge opportunity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday, the minister for Europe, David Lidington, said, \u201cIt\u2019s more important to get it right than to have it early.\u201d\n\nFor the French and Germans, who will be crucial, the British election is \u201cthe beginning of a process,\u201d said Vivien Pertusot, who is based in Brussels for the French Institute of International Relations. \u201cFor the French and Germans, what are the concessions they are willing to make, and what are the red lines they are not willing to cross?\u201d he asked. \u201cThose are two questions the two capitals, the two administrations, are not yet able to answer.\u201d\n\nBoth Germany and France want Britain, a major economic and military power, to remain. Despite traditional French skepticism about Britain\u2019s commitment to the European idea, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said Thursday that \u201cBritain is a military power, a diplomatic power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf such an important country leaves Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cit will give an extremely negative impression of Europe.\u201d\n\nA British exit would leave France militarily lonely, even if both countries are NATO members, and could end any effective European security and defense policy.\n\nThe Germans are also anxious. Ms. Merkel has, as usual, kept her opinions largely private. Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been tough about giving too much away to Greece or Britain.\n\nBut this week, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said, \u201cWe want Britain as an active partner at the center of the E.U.,\u201d while warning the British to respect \u201cwhere the limits of European accommodation lie.\u201d\n\nA British or Greek exit would affect the future status of the European Union, and of Germany. A British exit would make the fact of German domination of the European Union even more obvious, which would pain Berlin, and the loss of Britain\u2019s contribution to the budget would cost both France and Germany, which would have to pay more.\n\n\u201cAgainst the background of Ukraine and the larger question of what to do about Russia, a Brexit or Grexit would have geopolitical consequences, and that is informing German thinking more now than a year ago,\u201d said Hans Kundnani, a Berlin-based analyst of European and German affairs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more willingness to do a deal,\u201d Mr. Kundnani added. Ms. Merkel, he said, \u201cdoes talk about how Grexit will be perceived in China and Russia, and to lose Britain would show the E.U. incapable of solving our own problems.\u201d", "summary": "He wants to ensure that countries that do not use the euro, like Britain, cannot be hurt by rules made to govern the eurozone, to protect free trade in goods and financial services.The British desire to limit migration has already led \u201cmany on the Continent to view Britain as a nasty country,\u201d said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform here.What Mr. Cameron suggests he wants may seem considerable on the Continent but risibly unambitious to euroskeptic Britons, especially within his own Conservative Party, who see this negotiation as a chance for fundamental change in Britain\u2019s ties to the European Union.A British exit would leave France militarily lonely, even if both countries are NATO members, and could end any effective European security and defense policy.A British exit would make the fact of German domination of the European Union even more obvious, which would pain Berlin, and the loss of Britain\u2019s contribution to the budget would cost both France and Germany, which would have to pay more."}
