{"title": "In Greece, Migrants Are Desperate to Flee Again", "authors": ["Suzanne Daley"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/world/europe/in-greece-migrants-are-desperate-to-flee-again.html", "body": "But many have been stuck here for months, making a life as best they can behind broken fences and waist-high weeds, out of sight of the Greeks who shout insults and throw garbage at them when they venture into the streets.\n\nThere is a barber chair in one of the factories and an area where the young men do chin-ups on the pipes. They charge their cellphones from a fuse box at a nearby construction site and pool their resources to cook, usually one meal a day, usually rice. But there is no getting away from the filthy toilets, the boredom and the fear that they will not be able to move on.\n\nInside the factories, the immigrants divide by age, country of origin and tribal affiliations. The teenagers \u2014 with American television shows on their smartphones \u2014 still have hope about what life may yet offer, and a charity that provides breakfast, showers and access to the Internet.\n\nBut the older men receive no such help, and many have grown bitter. \u201cDo you think this is fun?\u201d one of the men said before walking away. \u201cDo you think we are used to living in trash where we come from?\u201d\n\nWith its economy in tatters, Greece has plenty of its own citizens barely surviving and few resources to help the many immigrants who have continued to arrive in recent years. Watchdog groups have repeatedly cited Greece for wretched conditions in many of its detention centers and, more recently, for pushing immigrants back into Turkey.\n\nEven those who are free to move around Greece say that immigrants face overwhelming hostility. According to the Greek investigative magazine Hot Doc, a top police official was recorded in December saying that the lives of unauthorized migrants should \u201cbe made unbearable.\u201d\n\nSome of the young men trying to get on the ferries tell stories of the Taliban invading their villages, of wandering from country to country after their parents died. Some show the scars of battle \u2014 a calf missing a chunk of flesh, a scar across a shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome have managed to sneak onto the ferries several times, only to be returned by the Italian authorities.\n\nAdvocates say many of the young men have unrealistic expectations of what they will find elsewhere in the European Union. \u201cBut what can you say?\u201d said Christina Tampakopoulou, a member of a volunteer group, the Movement for the Defense of Refugee and Migrant Rights, that sometimes visits the men and assists when it can. \u201cHere, it is worse.\u201d\n\nBy early afternoon, it was time to change into dark clothes and slip between the bent bars of the fence surrounding the ferry terminal. The young men could be seen darting among the lined-up 16-wheelers, searching for an unlocked container or, barring that, a way to hitch a ride under the trucks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Inspectors at the ferry terminal had little trouble spotting Mohammed Morsal, 27 years old and easily six feet tall, curled up in the spare-tire rack under a truck. Soon, he was in handcuffs.\n\nAsked whether his family knew where he was, Mr. Morsal, from Sudan, looked down at the floor and broke into sobs. \u201cThey are all dead,\u201d he said, before being escorted away by officials.\n\nTryfon Korontzis, the Coast Guard captain who oversees the port, says he is engaged in a sad cat-and-mouse game, aware each day that elsewhere in the world, Greeks, too, are trying to make a living in foreign countries. Most days his inspectors find two or three men hidden in the trucks. Some have been near death after spending hours in refrigerated containers or buried and gasping for air in piles of cotton seed.\n\nReleased after six hours in detention, Mr. Morsal made his way back to a tire factory, where stained mattresses were scattered about.\n\nHe applied for asylum five years ago, he said, but his case is among the 25,000 in a backlog here. He has never heard anything from the authorities. Even if he did, the news would probably not be good. Greece granted asylum to fewer than 5 percent of applicants last year, according to European Union statistics.\n\n\u201cWe eat from garbage like animals,\u201d Mr. Morsal said. \u201cThese people drive by on motorcycles and they throw bottles at us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Morsal has tried to find work here, as have most of the men who live in the factories. Not long ago he worked in the strawberry fields south of here for a month, but the farmer would not pay him.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants say that men like Mr. Morsal are in a kind of bureaucratic black hole. European Union rules say he cannot apply for asylum anywhere else, now that he has filed his papers in Greece. He must stay here and wait.\n\n\u201cHe has no choices,\u201d said Daniel Esdras, who heads the office of the International Organization for Migration in Athens, which helps immigrants go home. Last year, 10,000 immigrants chose that route, including many Georgian women who had labored in Greece for years as housekeepers and lost their jobs because the Greek families who employed them could no longer afford their wages. Three years ago, only 400 signed up with the group.\n\nBut going home is only an option for the immigrants who do not fear for their lives.\n\nMohammed Riza said he could not return to Iran. He was studying, teaching English and living with his parents until the authorities got wind of his interest in Christianity and the police came looking for him. \u201cThey hang you for that in my country,\u201d said Mr. Riza, explaining why he had headed for Europe on a bus. He said that his father, who is a mechanic, and his mother, who runs a clothing shop, had encouraged him to flee.\n\nHe showed a grainy video of his family on his phone, a slight smile on his face. Mr. Riza also has four seasons of \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d on his phone.\n\nLike most everyone else in the factory here, he said, he has moments of depression.\n\nBut his friends provide moments of humor. After being thwarted at the ferry terminal recently, they carried scavenged pieces of Styrofoam insulation to the beach to use as surfboards.\n\nSoon, Mr. Riza and the others were in their underwear, splashing and teasing one another. One of the boys started paddling furiously. \u201cLook,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI am going to Italy.\u201d", "summary": "But many have been stuck here for months, making a life as best they can behind broken fences and waist-high weeds, out of sight of the Greeks who shout insults and throw garbage at them when they venture into the streets.The teenagers \u2014 with American television shows on their smartphones \u2014 still have hope about what life may yet offer, and a charity that provides breakfast, showers and access to the Internet.With its economy in tatters, Greece has plenty of its own citizens barely surviving and few resources to help the many immigrants who have continued to arrive in recent years.According to the Greek investigative magazine Hot Doc, a top police official was recorded in December saying that the lives of unauthorized migrants should \u201cbe made unbearable.\u201dTryfon Korontzis, the Coast Guard captain who oversees the port, says he is engaged in a sad cat-and-mouse game, aware each day that elsewhere in the world, Greeks, too, are trying to make a living in foreign countries."}
