In addition, in countries like Eritrea, where many of the Lampedusa victims came from, relatives of migrants risk repercussions from an oppressive government.\n\nStill, over the past years, small groups of family members of presumed victims have traveled to Italy \u2014 initially to Rome but now to the lab \u2014 hoping to find news of their loved ones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey bring fragments of lost lives \u2014 photographs, ID cards and photos or videos, clinical and dental records and personal effects like toothbrushes or combs \u2014 to help make a match.\n\nAt the lab, assisted by a psychologist, they are interviewed by trained personnel and then pore through an evolving database of personal effects, like bracelets or necklaces, phones, or clothes, looking for identifying clues.\n\nDNA comparisons are also made, and much of the data is culled from autopsies: tattoos, surgery scars, dental records and other biological remains.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nAdal Neguse, 40, an Eritrean migrant now living in Stockholm, was the first relative to arrive in Lampedusa after the Oct. 3, 2013, shipwreck, searching for his brother Abraham.\n\nHe determined from survivors that his brother had perished, and spent a fruitless week trying to find his corpse, looking at photographs of the victims.\n\n\u201cI finally had to stop because it was too disturbing,\u201d he said. Abraham was eventually identified some months later through the clothing he was wearing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And this April, more than 700 people drowned when their ship sank some 70 nautical miles off Libya.\n\nThe Italian Navy began removing the corpses from the wreck near Libya in July and Dr. Cattaneo\u2019s team has been carrying out the autopsies in an improvised, but high-tech, tent set up on a NATO base in Melilli, Sicily.\n\nThe team involves experts from four universities as well as biologists, anthropologists, forensic dentists and specialized technicians developing a single protocol that can be used in any shipwreck situation, she said.\n\nAfter autopsies, the victims have been buried in cemeteries throughout Sicily.\n\nSo far, some 20 victims have been identified through the lab\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small number, but it means that the procedure works,\u201d Dr. Cattaneo said. \u201cThe problem is how to enlarge it. The bigger the numbers, the bigger the costs.\u201d\n\nMr. Piscitelli\u2019s office has been lobbying to expand the database to include the victims of all shipwrecks in Italy. As of now, the lab has focused on three major shipwrecks. Other disasters have been handled by local police and prosecutors, and Mr. Piscitelli would like to better coordinate their results into one database.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut for now, his office does not have the resources. Humanitarian agencies charge that few resources are allocated to missing migrants because the dead are not a priority.\n\nAs political strife and economic conditions remain unstable in parts of the Middle East and Africa, there is no indication that migrants will stop gambling their lives for a better future in Europe any time soon. And if anything, those here say, the need for their work will continue to expand.\n\n\u201cIt will never be over as long as poor people attempt the Mediterranean crossing, putting their lives at risk,\u201d Mr. Piscitelli said."}
