He was convicted of fraud in 2014 and sentenced to house arrest.\n\nMr. Navalny\u2019s team provided photographs and descriptions of the various properties, including a 45,000-square-foot chalet in Sochi, Russia, the site of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nThey said Mr. Medvedev also controlled through his associates a 30,000-square-foot mansion in the most prestigious gated community in the Moscow region, a property with an indoor swimming pool, an artificial pond, a huge garage and a detached house for security guards.\n\nIn a tiny village in the Kursk region in central Russia, where some of Mr. Medvedev\u2019s ancestors lived, Mr. Medvedev has built a rural estate with formal gardens, an artificial pond and a helipad, all surrounding another enormous mansion, the report said. A small chapel was erected on the site of Mr. Medvedev\u2019s ancestral house.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Putin in the next presidential election, in March 2018. In February, however, a district court in the small city of Kirov pronounced him guilty of defrauding a state company. The conviction, widely dismissed as politically motivated, rendered him ineligible to run.\n\nMr. Navalny is the only Russian opposition politician who enjoys a broad and enthusiastic following among the public. In a 2013 run for Moscow mayor, he received 27.2 percent of the vote \u2014 just short of the threshold needed to force the Kremlin-backed candidate into a runoff.\n\nDespite the criminal conviction, Mr. Navalny still plans to run for president. Analysts said Thursday that the release of the report underlined the depth of his presidential ambitions.\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Navalny is playing it serious and is not joking, then the first he has to remove from the field is Mr. Medvedev,\u201d Gleb Pavlovsky, a political analyst and former media adviser to the Kremlin, said in his Facebook account."}
