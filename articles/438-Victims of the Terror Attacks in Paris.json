(Most of the cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo used some sort of pen name.) He was born in 1957 and contributed to a wide variety of publications, according to Le Monde, the French daily newspaper. \u201cHe was the last one to enter the team,\u201d Mr. Leconte said, describing the group that was at the heart of Charlie Hebdo\u2019s creative output. \u201cHe was in a way more shy in person. But not when he draws. His caricatures are so dynamic.\u201d\n\nAhmed Merabet\n\nMr. Merabet, 40, a police officer who was killed as he lay wounded on the ground, inspired a Twitter hashtag, #JeSuisAhmed \u2014 I am Ahmed \u2014 as many praised him for defending a newspaper that was accused of insulting his Muslim faith. At a news conference on Saturday, relatives called him a pillar of their family. \u201cMy brother was Muslim, and he was killed by fake Muslims,\u201d said Malek Merabet. The family also urged people to \u201cstop conflating things, triggering wars, burning mosques or synagogues.\u201d Officer Merabet was assigned to the police precinct in Paris\u2019s 11th Arrondissement, according to Rocco Contento, a police union official who knew him. \u201cHe was a nice person, very likable, always with a smile and very professional,\u201d Mr. Contento said. Officer Merabet, whose parents were from North Africa, lived in a suburb north of Paris with a large immigrant community, was unmarried and had no children.\n\nPhilippe Honor\u00e9\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Honor\u00e9, 74, was the fifth Charlie Hebdo cartoonist to be declared killed in the attack, according to the news agency Agence France-Presse. His cartoon of the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \u2014 wishing his audience a happy new year and \u201cabove all, good health!\u201d \u2014 was the last drawing to be posted on Twitter before the attack. After publishing his first drawing in the newspaper Sud-Ouest at the age of 16, Mr. Honor\u00e9 went on to collaborate with several French media outlets.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boisseau\n\nMr. Boisseau, 42, a maintenance worker employed by the Sodexo services company, was killed in the lobby of the building when the attack started. The company said that Mr. Boisseau was married, with two children, and that Sodexo staff members had mourned him with a minute of silence at midday on Thursday. A statement by Sodexo\u2019s chief executive, Michel Landel, on the company\u2019s website expressed \u201cimmense sadness\u201d over Mr. Boisseau\u2019s death. \u201cAll together, we share the feeling that it is intolerable that one of our colleagues lost his life in such tragic and unfair circumstances, in the name of a cause so contrary to our values,\u201d Mr. Landel wrote.\n\nJean Cabut\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Cabut, known as Cabu, was born in 1938 and studied art in Paris. He helped found Hara-Kiri, the predecessor to Charlie Hebdo, after serving in the military in Algeria. \u201cHe\u2019s an artist, a poet, a sweet man and a great journalist,\u201d said Mr. Leconte, the filmmaker. He said Mr. Cabut was always drawing, sketching even places he passed every day. Mr. Cabut\u2019s style, Ms. Mouly said, was political, and similar to Saul Steinberg, a style more familiar to American audiences. He often caricatured politicians, and his most famous character was Le Grand Duduche, an awkward adolescent. Ms. Mouly compared his cartoons featuring that character to the work of the American cartoonist Jules Feiffer. His political drawings \u201cdidn\u2019t stop him from drawing Muhammad,\u201d Ms. Mouly said. \u201cWhatever was at the topic of the day.\u201d\n\nMustapha Ourrad\n\nMr. Ourrad, a proofreader at Charlie Hebdo, was an orphan who was born in Algeria and moved to France when he was 20, according to the Le Monde.

Mr. Cohen was the grandson of a famous Jewish-Tunisian singer who died a month before him in December, Le Parisien reported. The deputy mayor of Sarcelles, Fran\u00e7ois Pupponi, said that Mr. Cohen\u2019s family was devastated. \u201cHe was a nice boy,\u201d Mr. Pupponi said. \u201cI knew him by sight and his friends, too. This is a tragedy that affects all of the city and the Jewish community.\u201d\n\nIN A PARIS SUBURB\n\nClarissa Jean-Philippe\n\nMs. Philippe, who was in her 20s, was a police officer who had been on the job a short time and was still in training, according to Le Monde. Her colleagues described her as \u201clively and dynamic.\u201d She was from the French Caribbean island of Martinique, where she left behind her family to move to Paris, according to Paris Match magazine.
