The Socialists\u2019 leader, Evangelos Venizelos, called for a national unity government, saying that a coalition with only the Socialists and New Democracy would not have legitimacy. Calling Sunday an \u201cexceptionally painful day,\u201d Mr. Venizelos said that the Greek parties that had said there was an alternative to the loan agreement had misled voters. \u201cGod of Greece, help us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe New Democracy leader, Antonis Samaras, on Sunday appeared to reject the possibility of a coalition with the Socialists. He called instead for a \u201cgovernment of national salvation\u201d aimed at \u201cmodifying\u201d the terms of a second loan agreement Greece signed with creditors in February, while still keeping Greece in the euro zone. The clear winner in the elections, the leader of Syriza, Alexis Tsipras, called for a coalition of left-wing parties.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn spite of the party leaders\u2019 declarations to the contrary, some analysts said they would not rule out the possibility that New Democracy and the Socialists could form a coalition for their political survival, though it would have little legitimacy in the wake of elections in which voters migrated to anti-austerity parties.\n\nThe success of Golden Dawn is the ultimate expression of a protest vote. The party has gained ground by campaigning on the streets of Athens, where many residents fear a sharp rise in illegal immigration and where politicians from mainstream parties resist treading for fear of attacks by angry voters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe party\u2019s leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, pledged to \u201cfight the memorandum of the junta inside and outside Parliament,\u201d referring to Greece\u2019s debt deal with creditors.\n\nIn the Athens neighborhood of Agios Panteleimonas, where the recent increase in the number of illegal immigrants has changed the texture of the area, Sotirios Dimos, 43, a post office employee, said that although he had always supported the Socialists, on Sunday he voted for Golden Dawn. \u201cThe Socialists were incapable of doing anything,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next Greek government, inheriting a deepening recession and facing the likelihood of social unrest, will have to enforce a loan agreement with its creditors \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The deal stipulates slashing $15.5 billion from the state budget over the next two years and completing a crucial bank recapitalization.\n\nVideo\n\nYet with Greece\u2019s gross national product having dropped 20 percent since 2009 and unemployment soaring to 21 percent, fierce opposition to the bailout terms \u2014 tax increases and wage cuts \u2014 has led to the implosion of the Socialist and New Democracy Parties, and the rise of parties on the right and the left that oppose the loan deal.\n\nThat anger was palpable on Sunday in Neos Kosmos, a middle-class district near central Athens. Evgenia Vogiatzi, a 45-year-old teacher and a lifelong Socialist, said that Greece was \u201cin a state of enslavement\u201d that had led her to support the Communist Party, which backs a return to the drachma, Greece\u2019s currency before the euro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had my salary cut 30 percent, I\u2019m paying taxes through the nose and they\u2019re talking about more cuts,\u201d Ms. Vogiatzi said. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes to stay in Europe, I don\u2019t want Europe.\u201d\n\nIn the upper-middle-class Psychiko neighborhood in Athens, many supporters of the Socialist Party, known here as Pasok, said they had voted for radical-left Syriza for the first time. \u201cI voted in anger,\u201d said Evangelia Grillaki, 65, a retired florist. \u201cWe feel 1,000 percent betrayed.\u201d\n\nSyriza, a coalition of leftist parties founded in 2004 that included splinter groups from Greece\u2019s more hard-line Communist Party, appeared to receive the bulk of the Socialist protest vote. Led by Mr. Tsipras, 38, the party is in favor remaining in the euro zone and the European Union, unlike the Communist Party, but has opposed the loan agreement.\n\n\u201cThe parties that signed the memorandum without asking the Greek people are now a minority,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said Sunday night. \u201cThe people\u2019s voice canceled the legitimacy of their signatures,\u201d he said, adding that the election results in Greece were \u201ca crushing defeat\u201d to the austerity policies of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.", "summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a completely fragmented Parliament,\u201d said Loukas Tsoukalis, the president of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, an Athens research institute.Calling Sunday an \u201cexceptionally painful day,\u201d Mr. Venizelos said that the Greek parties that had said there was an alternative to the loan agreement had misled voters.The party\u2019s leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, pledged to \u201cfight the memorandum of the junta inside and outside Parliament,\u201d referring to Greece\u2019s debt deal with creditors.In the Athens neighborhood of Agios Panteleimonas, where the recent increase in the number of illegal immigrants has changed the texture of the area, Sotirios Dimos, 43, a post office employee, said that although he had always supported the Socialists, on Sunday he voted for Golden Dawn.\u201cThe people\u2019s voice canceled the legitimacy of their signatures,\u201d he said, adding that the election results in Greece were \u201ca crushing defeat\u201d to the austerity policies of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany."}
