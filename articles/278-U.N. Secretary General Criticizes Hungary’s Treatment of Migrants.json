Secretary General Criticizes Hungary\u2019s Treatment of Migrants", "authors": ["Somini Sengupta"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/world/europe/un-secretary-general-criticizes-hungarys-treatment-of-migrants.html", "body": "In reality, the five permanent members of the Security Council \u2014 Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States \u2014 decide, and usually behind closed doors. This year, the General Assembly is calling on candidates to present their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and ideas before the broader membership in informal sessions. Though in the end, nothing compels the council not to do what they\u2019ve always done: present the General Assembly with one name to rubber-stamp.\n\nAmong the permanent five, only the British ambassador has explicitly said that his country favored a female contender among equally qualified candidates.\n\nThe Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, pointed out what he saw as the risks of these calls for a woman leader. \u201cIf we keep saying, \u2018women, women,\u2019 men are not going to apply,\u201d he said in an interview this week, sounding somewhat exasperated.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d\n\nMr. Ban said he had spoken to the Hungarian prime minister and asked him to treat migrants within the bounds of international law. \u201cSince they are people fleeing wars and persecution then we must assure our compassionate leadership,\u201d he said, calling on European countries to first provide migrants with water and shelter, and then discuss how they are to be accommodated.\n\nThird, he expressed unease about the reports of Russia\u2019s stepped-up military backing of the Syrian regime. This was most unusual because Mr. Ban rarely criticizes a permanent member of the Security Council, even obliquely.\n\nIn answer to a question about Russia, he said he was \u201cconcerned about the parties arming, providing arms\u201d and predicted that it would \u201conly help the situation growing worse and worse, deteriorate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe went on to say what he has said many times: that only a political agreement can end the war, not military victory. He reiterated the numbers on Syria: 250,000 dead and 11 million people displaced in five years of war.", "summary": "In reality, the five permanent members of the Security Council \u2014 Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States \u2014 decide, and usually behind closed doors.
