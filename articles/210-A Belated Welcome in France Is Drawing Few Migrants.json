But as thousands crowded into the city, the French officials came back with only 600 people.\n\nIt was not, insisted Pascal Brice, the refugee office director, because they found France unattractive. \u201cThey were doing what all the others were doing, staying in Germany,\u201d Mr. Brice said. Besides, he explained, \u201cthere was no more arrival of refugees\u201d after Germany closed its borders.\n\nYet many were already in place there. As Mr. Brice acknowledged, \u201cThere were thousands of migrants in Munich; we were there to help the Germans.\u201d\n\nThe migrants\u2019 \u201cfirst reaction was surprise\u201d as the French made their pitch, Mr. Brice said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t expect to find another country there,\u201d offering to help.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe surprise should not have been unexpected. France, with its high unemployment and incendiary political rhetoric about keeping migrants out and borders closed, has not exactly put out a welcome mat, in economic or emotional terms, said a number of experts on the question.\n\nThere has been no French equivalent of the maternal image of Chancellor Angela Merkel offering succor. Pro-migrant demonstrations in France have been small compared with the hundreds of Germans who have flocked to train stations to help.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

From being a European leader for asylum demands, France slipped to fifth or sixth in the first three months of the year, Mr. Brice said.\n\nA recent pledge by the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, to take in an additional 24,000 migrants over two years \u2014 after refusing for months to countenance the idea of quotas \u2014 was criticized by the news media in France and elsewhere in Europe as a drop in the bucket compared with Germany\u2019s projection that it would take in close to a million migrants this year.\n\nThe French news media, rueful or defensive, have picked up on the decisive migrant plebiscite for Germany over France as further evidence of France\u2019s relative decline.\n\n\u201cThese migrants who don\u2019t dream of France,\u201d read the front-page headline of Le Monde on Sunday. The cover of Le Point, a right-leaning weekly newsmagazine, lamented: \u201cThe Incredible Madame Merkel. If only she were French.\u201d\n\nIn Le Figaro, a columnist wrote: \u201cValues, that was all we had left. And now we\u2019ve screwed that up as well,\u201d before transitioning to the cynic\u2019s interpretation of German generosity: The country\u2019s industrialists need help.\n\nMr. Corty, of M\u00e9decins du Monde, noted that the lack of receptiveness to migrants was more than emotional, but practical as well. Though France receives about 60,000 demands for asylum annually, the country has only 25,000 places in welcome centers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday morning, French officials moved about 800 migrants, many of them Sudanese, who were squatting at two outdoor sites in Paris \u2014 near a train station and local municipal offices \u2014 to reception centers, where they will be able to make asylum requests, officials said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of families who say, we don\u2019t want to stay out of doors,\u201d Mr. Corty said. \u201cFrance has not put in good conditions.\u201d\n\nAt more than 10 percent, unemployment in France is roughly twice that of Germany and Britain. And it can take up to two years for an asylum request to be processed, longer than in some neighboring countries.\n\nBut less neutral messages are emanating from France as well. Mayors have been asked by the interior minister to receive migrants in their towns, but some are refusing to go along.\n\nIn the towns of Belfort and Roanne, the mayors have been quoted as saying they want only Christian refugees. Other mayors have spoken out loudly about their financial inability to handle a flood of migrants, or of constituents who are themselves waiting for subsidized housing.\n\n\u201cUntil the last few days, France has not given the impression of wanting to open its arms to the migrants,\u201d Mr. Weil said. And \u201cMr. Hollande has not been Mme. Merkel.\u201d"}
