Makeover or not, it is the same old National Front.\n\nMigrants bring filth, crime, poverty and Islamic terrorism, Ms. Le Pen has suggested in recent weeks; a dead migrant child\u2019s photo was simply a ploy to manipulate European feelings of guilt. France is about to be \u201csubmerged\u201d in a \u201cterrifying\u201d wave of migrants who represent only a \u201cburden.\u201d\n\nIt is an issue ready-made for her party, and one that could fill the sails of like-minded, rightist parties across Europe. It has already helped lift Ms. Le Pen in the polls before regional elections in December in this somber city, where drifts of trash blow about in the shadow of an immense Gothic cathedral. National surveys have her easily pushing into second place in 2017 presidential elections.\n\nNever mind that, by and large, the migrants entering Europe recently do not want to come France, but have headed mostly to Germany or Sweden. Or that France has agreed to accept just 30,000 asylum seekers over two years, compared with Germany\u2019s proposed embrace of as many as one million.\n\nThe migrants \u2014 \u201cillegals\u201d as Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party calls them \u2014 \u201cstrain our public accounts\u201d at the expense of \u201cour own,\u201d she told party activists in Marseille in September.\n\n\u201cMigrants are now wandering in our neighborhoods, around the train stations or in the slums, the cause for France of immense security and public hygiene problems,\u201d she told them. \u201cWe are now becoming accustomed to terrorism,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Friday, Ms. Le Pen told supporters in Calais, where thousands of migrants are squatting, that the city is \u201cbesieged, in the exact meaning of the word.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Le Pen\u2019s harshness has shocked even French politicians on the mainstream right, traditionally tough on immigration issues. Immediately, former President Nicolas Sarkozy accused her of \u201cbrutality\u201d and \u201cinhumanity.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as the migration crisis grows, mainstream politicians, left and right, are all struggling to squeeze into a shrinking middle ground between the embrace of the Germans and the tear gas of the Hungarians.\n\nNot Ms. Le Pen.\n\nYet the far-right leader may be closer to the public mood in a country still stunned by the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January and fearful of Muslim immigrants ringing the cities.\n\nPolls show the French to be \u201cvery reticent\u201d about receiving migrants, as the newspaper Le Monde recently put it, with barely half in favor.\n\nSo by the time Ms. Le Pen arrived in this stronghold of her party recently, the migrant crisis was already topmost on the minds of her supporters. They knew where she stood, and they approved.\n\nLondon Channel Tunnel BRITAIN Calais france Paris 40 miles\n\n\u201cTo take in foreigners \u2014 it just isn\u2019t possible,\u201d said Jacky Roussell, a retired worker at the closed Goodyear tire factory, wearing a two-day stubble.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already living in poverty here. There are French people living in the street. Besides, you don\u2019t even know if there are jihadists among them,\u201d Mr. Roussell said. \u201cWe can\u2019t take in everyone, can we?\u201d\n\nMs. Le Pen, after a month of inflammatory words on migrants in media appearances and speeches to supporters, only alluded to the issue as she launched her regional elections campaign, aboard a boat here in front of a gaggle of French journalists.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s exactly the opposite,\u201d said Hugues Sion, a departmental councilor who attended the rally here. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of fear. It\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nBut on both points, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s recent anti-immigrant initiative suggested the opposite. Manipulation of fear and of facts have appeared to shadow her words.\n\nIn a recent radio interview, for instance, she claimed that among the Syrian migrants, \u201cfor the immense majority who are coming,\u201d they were not fleeing the government of Bashar al-Assad, \u201cbecause once again it is not Bashar al-Assad who is persecuting the Syrian people, it is Islamic State.\u201d\n\nBut most analysts suggest, as do interviews with the migrants, that government bombing campaigns are as much, if not more, to blame for the wave of refugees, than persecution by the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThere is only a tiny minority of political refugees,\u201d Ms. Le Pen claimed, saying that she \u201cwould fight\u201d if her own country was at war \u2014 an irony since among the National Front\u2019s important early founders were avowed Nazi collaborators.\n\n\u201cIn the coming years, we could be in the presence of the invasions that were lived through in the Fourth Century,\u201d said Ms. Le Pen, referring to the Barbarian invasions of Western Europe.\n\nThose invasions largely targeted what is now France in the Fifth Century, historians say. But no matter, the point was made."}
