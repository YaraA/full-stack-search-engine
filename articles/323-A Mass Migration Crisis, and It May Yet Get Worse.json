Yemen is not much farther away from Europe than Eritrea, now the biggest source of African refugees, just across the Red Sea, and at some 25 million it is as populous as Afghanistan.\n\nNor is it only the Middle East and North Africa that European leaders need to consider. The Gallup Poll, based on data compiled from more than 450,000 interviews in 151 nations from 2009 to 2011, found that in Nigeria, which already has double the population of Germany, 40 percent of people would emigrate to the West if they could. And the lesson of 2015 \u2014 for them and much of the world \u2014 is that they can.\n\nSchengen Area countries do not require passports or controls between their common borders.

Syria was in the grip of a prolonged drought when war broke out, and large areas of sub-Saharan Africa are becoming uninhabitable. With rising sea levels, a single typhoon in the Bay of Bengal could drive millions of Bangladeshis from their homes in low-lying coastal areas and render that land uninhabitable, too.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEurope has spawned mass movements of refugees in the not-too-distant past \u2014 700,000 from the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1993, 1.1 million from Eastern Europe as the Iron Curtain was torn down in 1989 \u2014 but what is new now is not just the scale of the arrivals, in such large numbers over such a short period of time. It is also the sheer number and variety of problem places they are leaving behind.\n\nMany migrants are from countries where the West has tried to intervene and failed spectacularly \u2014 Iraq and Afghanistan, in particular.\n\nThere are now some two million Iraqi refugees, many bound for Europe. Among them are people like Muhammad Basher, a young Kurdish doctor from Iraq, who took his life savings of $2,000 and had spent nearly all of it by the time he reached the Croatian border \u2014 $1,200 just for a seat in a rubber dinghy on a dangerous sea crossing to Greece.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\n\u201cBetter to die quickly there, than slowly in Iraq,\u201d he said.\n\nSayid Karim Hashimi, 23, a native of Kunduz, was among the Afghans recently crossing the border out of Serbia.\n\n\u201cThere is no future in Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n\nLibya represents another failed intervention, by the French and British, with American support. Although few Libyans have been prompted to join the exodus, the chaos in their country has made it easier than ever before for other African migrants to flee to Europe through northern Africa.\n\nWhile most of the migrants have been from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, those who came through villages like this last summer could have arrived from almost anywhere.\n\nTwo women from Haiti and a young girl, the daughter of one of them, passed through in early October, according to officials here representing the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They had flown to Turkey from Haiti, then joined smugglers\u2019 routes through the Balkans.\n\nPhoto\n\nOthers come from places like Eritrea, where young men are fleeing a brutal dictatorship that offers them the prospect of a lifetime of unpaid military service, and little else. Some are escaping civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo or poverty in nations like Gambia or Senegal. Many, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, are motivated by elemental problems like spreading desertification. Others are looking for economic opportunity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIbrahim Isahaq, 18, from Ghana, was among those migrants who came through Serbia in October, attracted by news of how easy passage had become. He was simply fleeing a family feud over a disputed inheritance. Youssou, 25, from Senegal, said his father was a commander in the little-known Casamance separatist movement, but he seemed more interested in business prospects in Europe.\n\n\u201cThere was no life for me in Senegal,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the migrant crisis has inspired a backlash among Europe\u2019s right-wing nationalist parties, particularly in the East, authorities say the problem is still manageable. \u201cWe need to keep our perspective on the numbers,\u201d said Alexander Betts, who heads the Refugee Studies Center at Oxford University.\n\n\u201cIf Lebanon can host one million Syrians, despite being the size of Maryland, a region the size of Europe should be able to host millions.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEven in the four European Union member countries that initially opposed a modest 120,000-migrant per nation resettlement quota \u2014 Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary \u2014 voices were raised in support of the migrants, who were to be distributed across the 28-member bloc. Though a quota system has yet to take full effect, a recent appeal, signed by former presidents and prime ministers and other prominent Europeans, many from those four countries, called on their countries to abandon their hostility to the migrants and remember their own recent past.\n\nThat might be a hard sell, however, in a Europe already preoccupied with terrorist recruitment among disaffected Muslim populations from earlier, much smaller migrations.\n\n\u201cThroughout Europe, xenophobia and open racism are running rampant, and nationalist, even far-right parties are gaining ground,\u201d Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister, wrote recently in an article that appeared on Project Syndicate, an online news service.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, this is only the beginning of the crisis, because the conditions inciting people to flee their homelands will only worsen. And the E.U., many of whose members have the world\u2019s largest and best-equipped welfare systems, appears to be overwhelmed by it \u2014 politically, morally and administratively.\u201d\n\nThose stresses pose a challenge for the future, experts say, because the flow is unlikely to ebb anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this wave can stop,\u201d said Sonja Licht of the International Center for Democratic Transition. \u201cIt can maybe from time to time be somewhat less intensive, we simply have to prepare. The global north must be prepared that the global south is on the move, the entire global south. This is not just a problem for Europe but for the whole world.\u201d"}
