But the strike, coupled with a smaller street demonstration in Barcelona than on other recent occasions, had relatively limited impact.\n\nSeparately, the two main Catalan parties confirmed that they would not campaign together for independence ahead of regional elections in December, after disagreeing over how to renew the joint ticket that brought them to office in late 2015.\n\nThe splintering is a potential blow for the conservative party of Carles Puigdemont, the region\u2019s former leader. Having left for Brussels, he is now hoping to get re-elected from there while also trying to avoid standing trial on rebellion charges in Madrid. Mr. Puigdemont argued in a Catalan radio interview from Brussels this week that the two parties should again run on a joint election platform \u2014 or risk losing to politicians who favor remaining part of Spain.\n\nPhoto\n\nCatalonia\u2019s elections were scheduled for Dec. 21 by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose central government took administrative control of Catalonia, using emergency constitutional powers, shortly after Catalan separatist lawmakers voted for independence from Spain on Oct. 27. That declaration was declared null and void by Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Rajoy\u2019s decision to hold quick elections \u2014 after ousting the entire regional government and also dissolving the Catalan Parliament \u2014 was intended to catch the separatists flat-footed. It was also intended to deal a decisive blow to the independence movement by showing that Madrid was committed to handing control back to Catalan politicians \u2014 but ones, it hopes, who favor keeping the region firmly anchored within Spain."}
