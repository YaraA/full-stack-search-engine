On Friday, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, said her party would \u201cprepare the legislation that would be required to enable a new independence referendum to take place.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, the calls to leave the United Kingdom may focus on the economic benefits of European Union membership, but they will also overlap with \u2014 and, if they are to succeed, rely upon \u2014 more visceral desires for independence.\n\nAfter all, the world has spent much of the last few centuries organizing itself under the principle of national self-determination, in which people with a common identity acquire their own state. Think of Italy for the Italians in the 1870s, Algeria for the Algerians in 1962, Tajikistan for the Tajiks in 1991 and so on.\n\nWhile this idea has brought liberation to much of the world, it has also contributed to countless wars, including Nazi Germany\u2019s invasions to \u201cunify\u201d with the German people of Austria and Czechoslovakia, the violent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethno-linguistic lines and the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nWhat makes the United Kingdom so unusual is that it brought together four nationalities who see themselves as distinct yet have chosen to coexist. Multinational states are rare. Some, like China, are undemocratic and oppose political organizing by minority groups, including Tibetans and Uighurs. Others, such as Russia and Nigeria, have struggled to peacefully and effectively unify.\n\nIn this way, the United Kingdom has been what the European Union always aspired to be but never accomplished: an honest-to-god political union that respects national identity while overcoming the complications of nationalism that helped make the 20th century the bloodiest in world history.\n\nStill, questions of national identity have pulled at the country since 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to become the Kingdom of Great Britain. Because the English have so dominated the country\u2019s politics, culture and economy \u2014 they are the largest group, and England\u2019s capital, London, became the kingdom\u2019s \u2014 Scots have long pushed for greater autonomy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese questions have been even harder for Northern Ireland, which experienced a violent internal conflict, partly over whether to remain in the United Kingdom or to join Ireland, for much of the 20th century\u2019s latter half. The long road to the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement illustrated the difficulty of keeping a multinational state together, and the calm in Northern Ireland since the agreement shows the value of such a state.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

While many analysts say this grew out of opposition to immigration or skepticism about Europe, Mr. Tombs suggested another driver: an English sense of being underrepresented in their own country.\n\nIn recent decades, the United Kingdom has kept unity by \u201cdevolving\u201d political authority to the three non-English nations, allowing them greater autonomy and independent institutions. Only England, for example, does not have its own Parliament.\n\nIt is hard to miss the significance that voters in one of the world\u2019s most successful multinational states just chose to leave the world\u2019s largest multinational government. And it is striking the degree to which the United Kingdom\u2019s four nations seem to have disagreed on that choice.\n\nThe European Union was explicitly founded to address problems of national and political identity. Britain, its most skeptical member, dealt with those very same problems \u2014 sooner, and with more success.\n\nNow the country could be about to abandon that project, even as the union, for all its setbacks, carries on. But it speaks to the promise of multinationalism that its most committed adherents in the United Kingdom are not the largest and most powerful group, but rather the minority Scottish and Irish so eager to be tied to something larger, even if that means leaving the old partnership to remain in Europe."}
