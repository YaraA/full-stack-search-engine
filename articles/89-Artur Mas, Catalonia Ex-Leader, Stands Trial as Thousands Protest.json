The nonbinding vote was \u201ca day of happiness and democratic strengthening,\u201d he said, but it did not fundamentally change Catalonia\u2019s relationship with the Spanish government.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough Spain\u2019s conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has promised to maintain the country\u2019s unity, the recent prosecution of other separatist politicians has added to the tensions between politicians in Madrid and Barcelona. Secessionists have presented themselves as victims of Madrid\u2019s refusal to uphold democratic values, like the right to vote.\n\nCarme Forcadell, the speaker of Catalonia\u2019s regional Parliament, who is also facing legal charges, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece last week that Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government was \u201cusing a politicized court system to silence dissent and democratic debate.\u201d\n\nSeparatist politicians face an uphill struggle, not just to hold an independence referendum, but also to convince their citizens that Catalonia stands to gain from breaking away from the rest of Spain.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Recent opinion polls have oscillated, but they have broadly suggested that Catalan society is split roughly evenly between backers and opponents of independence, even if a clear majority want to settle the debate with a vote.\n\nOn Monday, Rafael Catal\u00e1, the Spanish justice minister, said that the government would stop any such referendum this year.\n\n\u201cIf somebody is determined to speak about what is not possible and is determined to act against what is possible, the law will function and we will guarantee that it is respected in the whole of Spain,\u201d Mr. Catal\u00e1 told reporters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn regional elections in September 2015, voters gave separatist parties a majority of the parliamentary seats and 48 percent of the vote.\n\nMr. Mas was replaced as regional leader in January 2016 after a dispute among the separatist parties about his leadership and because of corruption cases centered on his party.\n\nIf the separatist groups are unable to overcome Madrid\u2019s legal obstacles, they are expected to call new elections this year."}
