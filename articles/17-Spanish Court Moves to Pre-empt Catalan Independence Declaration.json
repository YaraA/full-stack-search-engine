{"title": "Spanish Court Moves to Pre-empt Catalan Independence Declaration", "authors": ["Raphael Minder"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/world/europe/spain-catalonia-independence.html", "body": "The court order on Thursday suspended that session of Catalonia\u2019s Parliament \u2014 a step short of suspending the government itself \u2014 but the move is unlikely to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe court order was clearly intended to pre-empt any further moves toward independence. Carme Forcadell, the president of the Catalan Parliament, criticized the court for making its decision even before Catalan lawmakers had formally convened Monday\u2019s session. Ms. Forcadell did not say how Catalan lawmakers would respond to the court order.\n\nIf they choose to disobey it, separatist lawmakers have a range of options. They could schedule another session, meet at an alternative site or show up at Parliament anyway, which could prompt the police to intervene again.\n\nThe political standoff is having consequences for businesses. On Thursday, Sabadell, one of Spain\u2019s largest companies, announced that it would move its legal headquarters out of Catalonia to Alicante, in Spain\u2019s eastern region of Valencia, to reduce the legal risks linked to a possible Catalan secession.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Corporate departures could increase if the Catalan Parliament declares a unilateral declaration of independence. Sabadell and other Catalan financial institutions need to remain within the eurozone to ensure access to funding from the European Central Bank. Catalonia\u2019s membership in the European Union could be jeopardized if the region broke away without Madrid\u2019s approval.\n\nIn fact, Spain\u2019s government is set to approve a decree that would allow companies in Catalonia to relocate without necessarily having to obtain approval from a shareholders\u2019 assembly. The decree could help speed the departure of companies like CaixaBank, a giant savings bank that funds a wide range of social and cultural activities in Catalonia but that has most of its retail network in the other parts of Spain. Caixa\u2019s board is set to meet on Friday to discuss the issue.\n\nCatalonia accounts for almost a fifth of Spain\u2019s gross domestic product and has spearheaded the country\u2019s economic development since the late 19th century. While Catalonia has a distinct language and culture, the Catalan conflict with Madrid has also been closely tied to economic grievances. The main Catalan conservative party embraced separatism in 2012, at the height of Spain\u2019s banking crisis, after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s government refused to reduce the Catalan contribution to a Spanish tax system that redistributes money from the richest regions to poorer parts.\n\nShares in Sabadell rose 6 percent on Thursday after it announced its relocation, helping Spain\u2019s main stock market recover most of its losses from Wednesday, when it had its biggest one-day fall since last year\u2019s British referendum on leaving the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an editorial, El Pa\u00eds, Spain\u2019s leading newspaper, warned that the political turmoil was turning into an economic disaster. \u201cNobody should kid themselves: the extremely serious constitutional crisis in Catalonia will have a high cost for the Spanish economy \u2014 and for the Catalan economy too, of course,\u201d El Pa\u00eds warned.\n\nSeparatists, however, have repeatedly argued that the short-term cost of forming a republic would be bearable for Catalonia, and that an acrimonious split could hurt Spain more, notably because of Spain\u2019s mountain of debt.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday night, Mr. Puigdemont appealed for a mediated resolution to the dispute, even as he sharply criticized statements by King Felipe VI of Spain, who has condemned the Catalans\u2019 \u201cinadmissible disloyalty.\u201d\n\nMr. Rajoy rejected Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s call for outside arbitration of the conflict. \u201cThe unity of Spain cannot be subject to any mediation,\u201d he said."}
