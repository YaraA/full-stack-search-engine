{"title": "Britain\u2019s National Health Service, Creaking but Revered, Looms Over Elections", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/world/europe/britains-national-health-service-creaking-but-revered-looms-over-elections.html", "body": "Despite the system\u2019s many shortcomings and failures, regularly documented in newspapers and on television, there is no serious debate in Britain about moving away from universal health care. Indeed, the right-wing, populist U.K. Independence Party, the one British party to flirt with the idea of shifting to a private insurance system, has retreated on the issue.\n\nIn an era when Britons disdain their politicians and detest their bankers, government officials see the National Health Service as \u201cthe most revered public institution in this country,\u201d said Chris Ham, chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund, an independent health care charity.\n\n\u201cNo government would want to seriously entertain changing the basic principles on which health care is funded and provided,\u201d Mr. Ham said. \u201cIt would be electoral suicide to move away from that model, even though clearly it\u2019s under huge strain.\u201d\n\nThe system not only directly touches nearly every person in the country but also claims to be one of the world\u2019s five biggest employers, with a staff of more than 1.6 million people: up there with the Pentagon, McDonald\u2019s and Walmart.\n\nHealth care in Britain is funded by general taxation and payroll deductions, and with a few exceptions, such as dentistry and medication charges, treatment is delivered without any money changing hands. Britons can buy additional private insurance for more choice in treatment, but at the start of 2014, only 10.6 percent of the population was covered by such policies, according to LaingBuisson, a health care consulting firm.\n\nBy contrast, many continental European health systems are financed by insurance programs that require varying degrees of individual payment.\n\nBritain spends around \u00a3115 billion, or $172.8 billion, on the system each year, and even the use of outside companies to provide services is contentious \u2014 portrayed by the Labour Party as \u201cprivatization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Conservative-led coalition government says that private providers receive around 6 percent of the system\u2019s funding, up from around 4 percent in 2010.\n\nThis is ideologically ticklish because the N.H.S. was created in 1948 to help improve conditions for the survivors of World War II. Ill health was one of the \u201cfive giants\u201d \u2014 want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness \u2014 to be slain in postwar reconstruction.\n\nPartly because the Labour Party created the system, voters still trust it more on health than the Conservative Party, which, according to opinion surveys, scores better on economic competence.\n\nThough decades have elapsed since treatment was denied to those unable to pay, the founding principles of the British health system retain a strong grip.\n\nLast year, Bruce Keogh, medical director of N.H.S. England, described the service as \u201can international icon of the British social conscience,\u201d designed \u201cto replace fear with hope.\u201d\n\nMr. Keogh then summarized the challenges facing modern clinicians, who, confronted by almost infinite demand, already make difficult choices about where to deploy limited resources.\n\n\u201cMedicine has become much more advanced, has become more complex and more effective, but importantly, it has also become more expensive,\u201d Mr. Keogh said, adding that Britain was \u201cgripped in the quadruple pincer of increasing demand, escalating costs, a set of rising expectations, all in a constrained financial environment.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

England, predicted a funding gap by 2020 of \u00a38 billion a year between what the English health care system will receive and what it will need.\n\nThe Conservative-led government argues that it has protected health spending since 2010 despite deep cuts in other areas. Labour claims that standards are slipping. Partly because patients struggle to get appointments with family doctors, many go directly to emergency rooms instead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFigures for England showed that 91.8 percent of visits in the first three months of 2015 were dealt with in four hours, below a government target of 95 percent.\n\nThe Conservatives counter that health care in England, where they are in overall charge, outperforms that in Wales, where responsibility lies with the Labour-led Welsh authorities.\n\nYet debate is often conducted on an emotional level, with Labour highlighting shortages and casting its adversaries as uncaring and out of touch.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron, wealthy and educated at one of Britain\u2019s most exclusive schools, Eton College, points out that the N.H.S. cared for his son Ivan, who had cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy and died in 2009.\n\nBeneath the fog of competing statistics, the N.H.S.\u2019s performance is hard to assess. In 2014, the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation based in the United States, ranked England\u2019s as the most impressive of the 11 national health systems it compared.\n\nA less generous verdict came from another research institute, the Health Consumer Powerhouse, which is based in Sweden and ranked England\u2019s health service 14th out of 36.\n\nBut rarely do British politicians risk asking whether the structure created in 1948 can withstand the pressures of the 21st century.\n\nOne of the few tempted by this heretical thought is Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, who raised the possibility in 2012 of moving to an insurance-based system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a recent book, Mr. Farage, who has survived testicular cancer and two serious accidents, described good and bad treatment from the N.H.S.\n\nOne episode he recounted was of visiting a consultant when his left testicle was \u201cas large as a lemon and rock hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo say that this consultant was disinterested would be an understatement; perhaps he had a round of golf booked for the afternoon,\u201d Mr. Farage wrote. \u201c \u2018Keep taking the antibiotics,\u2019 he preached, and that was that.\u201d\n\nAfter deliberations, however, Mr. Farage\u2019s party opted for a commitment to keep health care free for Britons, while requiring immigrants and visitors to have medical insurance.\n\nOthers could have warned of the futility of challenging one of the few institutions still widely admired in Britain.\n\nIn his memoirs, Nigel Lawson, the chancellor of the Exchequer under Mrs. Thatcher, wrote that health practitioners regard themselves as \u201ca priesthood,\u201d making the sector \u201cextraordinarily difficult to reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Health Service,\u201d Mr. Lawson wrote, \u201cis the closest thing the English have to a religion.\u201d", "summary": "Health care in Britain is funded by general taxation and payroll deductions, and with a few exceptions, such as dentistry and medication charges, treatment is delivered without any money changing hands.Britons can buy additional private insurance for more choice in treatment, but at the start of 2014, only 10.6 percent of the population was covered by such policies, according to LaingBuisson, a health care consulting firm.Mr. Keogh then summarized the challenges facing modern clinicians, who, confronted by almost infinite demand, already make difficult choices about where to deploy limited resources.\u201cMedicine has become much more advanced, has become more complex and more effective, but importantly, it has also become more expensive,\u201d Mr. Keogh said, adding that Britain was \u201cgripped in the quadruple pincer of increasing demand, escalating costs, a set of rising expectations, all in a constrained financial environment.\u201dIn his memoirs, Nigel Lawson, the chancellor of the Exchequer under Mrs. Thatcher, wrote that health practitioners regard themselves as \u201ca priesthood,\u201d making the sector \u201cextraordinarily difficult to reform.\u201d"}
