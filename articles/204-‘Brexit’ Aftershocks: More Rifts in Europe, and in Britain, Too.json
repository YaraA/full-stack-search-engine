It will mean pulling out of the world\u2019s largest trading zone, with 508 million residents, including the 65 million people of Britain, and abandoning a commitment to the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. It has profound implications for Britain\u2019s legal system, which incorporates a large body of regulations that cover everything from product safety to digital privacy, and for Britain\u2019s economy.\n\nThe main ways in which the change will be felt are on trade \u2014 Britain will lose automatic access to the European single market \u2014 and on immigration, with Britain no longer bound to allow any European Union citizen to live and work in the country. Britain will have to try to negotiate new deals covering those issues.\n\nTo those in Britain who supported remaining in Europe, the result of Thursday\u2019s in-or-out referendum was a painful rejection, leaving the country exposed to a possible economic downturn and signaling a step away from the multiculturalism that they say has made Britain among Europe\u2019s most vibrant societies.\n\nThe Votes for Each Side\n\nTo backers of leaving, the outcome was vindication of their belief that Britain could pursue an independent course in the world, free of the Brussels bureaucracy and able to control the flow of immigrants into the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom,\u201d Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, one of the primary forces behind the push for a referendum on leaving the European Union, told cheering supporters just after 4 a.m.\n\nFor Mr. Cameron, the results were a humiliating disaster, forcing him to announce his departure only 13 months after he won re-election behind a surprisingly large Conservative majority in national elections. Critics said that he had led Britain out of Europe for no good reason and that the unity of the United Kingdom itself was threatened, with Scotland now more likely to try again to bolt.\n\nSpeaking in front of 10 Downing Street early Friday, with his wife, Samantha, standing nearby, Mr. Cameron said he would resign once a new leader had been chosen by his party, a decision he expected by October. He will stay now to provide stability, but a new prime minister, he said, should formally begin Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and negotiate the terms of that divorce.\n\n\u201cI held nothing back,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. His voice breaking, he said, \u201cI love this country and I feel honored to have served it.\u201d\n\nHis statement created an immediate churn in the political waters, with speculation that the two Conservatives most likely to succeed him are Boris Johnson, the flamboyant former mayor of London who helped lead the Leave campaign, and Theresa May, the Home secretary, who supported Mr. Cameron and Remain, but concentrated on doing her job rather than campaigning.\n\nMr. Johnson was booed Friday morning as he left his home in London, which voted overwhelmingly for Remain. In a brief statement later, Mr. Johnson praised Mr. Cameron, an old friend and rival from school days, as \u201can extraordinary politician\u201d and said he was sad to see him go.\n\nMr. Johnson refused to answer questions about his own future but praised the result. \u201cWe can find our voice in the world again, a voice that is commensurate with the fifth-biggest economy on earth,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut if Britain\u2019s Treasury and Central Bank are to be believed, the economic hit the country will take from leaving the single market of the European Union will be considerable, with permanent loss of economic growth, higher unemployment and lower tax receipts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe immediate market reaction was an effort to find a floor in the midst of so much uncertainty, said Barrington Pitt Miller, an equity research analyst at Janus Capital. But he said he expected British economic growth to be zero or negative in the short and medium term, with a secondary impact over time as London\u2019s financial services sector, which makes up about 10 percent of the economy, begins to move staff members and headquarters to Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin.\n\nA lot will depend on how the European Union chooses in the end to respond \u2014 whether it is \u201cvindictive, friendly or frightened,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Johnson and some in the Leave campaign argued that the other European nations valued trade with Britain so much that they would negotiate a special deal after Britain\u2019s withdrawal to let Britain remain in the single market without having to guarantee freedom of movement and labor. That seems highly unlikely because it would only encourage other nations to pressure Brussels. But it may be that as the dust settles, some sort of association agreement with Britain could be negotiated, as Ms. Merkel suggested on Friday, though the price could be high.\n\nThe economy aside, the United Kingdom itself now faces a threat to its survival. Scotland voted by 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the European Union, and the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Friday that it was \u201cdemocratically unacceptable\u201d for Scotland to be dragged out of it against its will. Another independence referendum, she said, \u201cis now highly likely.\u201d\n\nAppearing before reporters in front of the flags of Scotland and the European Union, Ms. Sturgeon, who leads the dominant Scottish National Party, said, \u201cIt is a statement of the obvious that the option of a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table.\u201d\n\nThe threat is real, but any new vote will not come soon, because it is only two years since the last one, which the Scottish nationalists lost, and the price of oil, on which the Scottish economy largely depends, has dropped.\n\nNorthern Ireland, too, voted for Remain, although Protestants and Roman Catholics, as usual, were split. But the prospect of an open border with Ireland now becoming a hard border between the European Union and the United Kingdom will change matters and require checks of passports and goods, putting strain on the Good Friday peace agreement.\n\nIn England, which voted for Leave, there are obvious strains, too.\n\nThey can be found between the young who voted in large numbers for Remain and those over 45, who voted for Leave; between the cities and the countryside; between richer and poorer; and between better educated and less educated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLondon itself, the glittering, expensive, multicultural and multinational global capital, with its many immigrants and liberal values, was isolated in a sea of those favoring Leave; in some sense, the vote was against the wealthy elites who live in London and rule everyone else from there.\n\nLast, there is the chasm between political leaders, nearly all of whom backed Remain, and many of their voters, who rebuffed them.\n\nBronwen Maddox, former editor of Prospect Magazine and the new director of the Institute for Government, a research institution, said in an email that \u201cthere is a growing intolerance for representative government, which is likely to have consequences for the ability of any government to run the country.\u201d\n\nThe referendum, she suggested, might have been about Brussels, but it revealed and unleashed many other forces. Those forces, she said, \u201chave ejected the U.K. from the European Union; they may now wreak similar turmoil on the old political parties themselves.\u201d"}
