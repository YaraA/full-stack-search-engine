He argued that most mainstream politicians had failed to directly address these public fears or to provide enough clarity in the migration debate, creating a vacuum that anti-immigrant leaders have rushed to fill.\n\nMr. Betts warned that unless political leaders could quickly articulate a nuanced argument for migration \u2014 one that confronts fears about security and religious differences, especially in the aftermath of the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris \u2014 public support for granting asylum to refugees could collapse. \u201cTo have attacks in Germany that are of a sexual nature perpetuated by men ostensibly of Muslim origin is symbolically devastating for a public commitment to asylum,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe public mood has been shifting for weeks and is already influencing policy. European news outlets reported on Tuesday that since Jan. 1, Germany had tightened screening of migrants trying to enter the country from Austria. Many other European countries erected fences or border checkpoints last year to block or divert the flow of migrants \u2014 moves that threatened to destroy Europe\u2019s system of open internal borders. In Denmark, the government is even moving to confiscate valuables from arriving migrants to defray the cost of accommodating them.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been Europe\u2019s most outspoken advocate of accepting refugees, emphasizing the humanitarian and moral imperative of doing so while seeking to rally ordinary Germans with her slogan, \u201cWe Can Do It!\u201d But Germany is bearing the brunt of the new arrivals, and critics have accused Ms. Merkel of failing to clearly articulate a plan for an integration process that is likely to last many years.\n\n\u201cIt seems as though the time has come for a broad debate over Germany\u2019s future \u2014 and Merkel\u2019s mantra of \u2018We Can Do It\u2019 is no longer enough to suppress it,\u201d wrote Der Spiegel, the German newsmagazine, which described the police\u2019s failure to stop the assaults in Cologne as \u201csymbolic of the state\u2019s powerlessness in the face of chaos and crime.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, polls show that far-right parties are gaining support in France, Germany and elsewhere.\n\nIn Austria, Herbert Kickl, general secretary of the right-wing Freedom Party, has called for an immediate halt to new asylum applications, while other party members have called for closing Austria\u2019s borders in the aftermath of the Cologne attacks. Many Austrians who are very wary of the Freedom Party\u2019s agenda concede that the influx of refugees has stirred an undercurrent of fear, even though the country has seen little violence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a split in society \u2014 in our editorial office, at the lunch table, in circles of friends,\u201d said Florian Klenk, editor in chief of Falter, a left-leaning weekly based in Vienna. \u201cIt is a polarization, but we have little violence.\u201d\n\nEven so, Peter Hacker, Vienna\u2019s appointed refugee coordinator, said the city had developed strategies to coordinate waves of migrants last September. \u201cWe decided then that we\u2019d have a maximum visible presence of police in the places, like train stations, where migrants were,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Hacker added: \u201cHere in Vienna, we have a clear political stance on refugees and migrants. Vienna has understood for decades that migrants are to be helped.\u201d\n\nMany analysts note that the Cologne assaults are especially damaging because anti-immigration critics and right-wing extremists are using them to discredit all migrants as criminals or hooligans, even though the overwhelming majority of migrants, many of them refugees fleeing war in Syria, are peaceful and law-abiding.\n\nBut fine distinctions have been blurred amid a climate of anxiety and insecurity in Europe that has widened divisions in politics, the news media and society alike.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But other witnesses, as well as an official at Finland\u2019s National Bureau of Investigation, later discounted any suggestion of similarities to the Cologne attacks.\n\nYet already, Finnish militia groups, including one called the Soldiers of Odin, are patrolling towns in the name of protecting women. Many of these groups have ties to far-right organizations, and their presence has become a major political issue.\n\nOpposition politicians have criticized the reluctance of Finland\u2019s right-wing government to condemn the militia patrols. The country\u2019s justice minister, Jari Lindstrom, a member of the populist, anti-immigration Finns party, caused a furor when he said the patrols did not worry him.\n\nEurope already endured a tumultuous 2015 that included the migrant crisis, the Greek debt crisis and two waves of terrorist attacks in Paris. For the European Union, no crisis has been more threatening than the influx of refugees, which has turned nation against nation and exposed the institutional shortcomings of the union\u2019s structure to address questions like external and internal security. Many analysts say the Cologne attacks have only intensified the pressure for drastic reforms to the European Union system.\n\n\u201cThe only way to deal with this problem is through the European Union,\u201d said Sergio Fabbrini, director of the school of government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cYet it is clear that the European Union doesn\u2019t have the institutional tools or political will to deal with it.\u201d", "summary": "He argued that most mainstream politicians had failed to directly address these public fears or to provide enough clarity in the migration debate, creating a vacuum that anti-immigrant leaders have rushed to fill.Mr. Betts warned that unless political leaders could quickly articulate a nuanced argument for migration \u2014 one that confronts fears about security and religious differences, especially in the aftermath of the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris \u2014 public support for granting asylum to refugees could collapse.\u201cIt seems as though the time has come for a broad debate over Germany\u2019s future \u2014 and Merkel\u2019s mantra of \u2018We Can Do It\u2019 is no longer enough to suppress it,\u201d wrote Der Spiegel, the German newsmagazine, which described the police\u2019s failure to stop the assaults in Cologne as \u201csymbolic of the state\u2019s powerlessness in the face of chaos and crime.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a split in society \u2014 in our editorial office, at the lunch table, in circles of friends,\u201d said Florian Klenk, editor in chief of Falter, a left-leaning weekly based in Vienna.In Finland, the Helsinki Police Department issued a statement on Jan. 7 claiming it had prevented a group of young Iraqi refugees from molesting women on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 an announcement that startled many Finns."}
