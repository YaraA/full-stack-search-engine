Also on the phone was an image of an article on a Tunisian man killed in January after he tried to attack a police station in Paris.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Molins also said that investigators had uncovered pictures, text messages and phone calls that showed he had been in close contact over the past year with three men who are now suspects. The authorities identified them as Ramzi A., 21, a native of Nice and a dual French-Tunisian citizen; Chokri C., 37, a Tunisian born in Sousse, Tunisia; and Mohamed Oualid G., 40, a dual French-Tunisian citizen born in La Marsa, Tunisia.\n\nMohamed Oualid G. and Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel called each other 1,278 times over the last year. Mohamed Oualid G. sent Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel a text message praising the attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, Mr. Molins said, and investigators found pictures on Mohamed Oualid G.\u2019s phone of the aftermath of the attack in Nice.\n\nInvestigators also found pictures on Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s phone from July 11 and July 13 of Mohamed Oualid G. in the truck used for the attack, he said.\n\nOn April 4, Chokri C. sent Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel a Facebook message advising him to \u201cload the truck\u201d and to \u201ccut the brakes, my friend, and I\u2019ll watch,\u201d Mr. Molins said. His fingerprints were also found on the truck\u2019s passenger door, and he was recorded by a surveillance camera in the truck beside Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, on the promenade in Nice, less than three hours before the attack, Mr. Molins said.\n\nA text message sent by Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel to Ramzi A. just minutes before the attack thanked him for an automatic pistol, which he then used to shoot at the police, and \u201casked for new ones,\u201d Mr. Molins said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, none of the men were known to French intelligence services, Mr. Molins said. Ramzi A. had a criminal record with convictions for theft, violence and drug use between 2013 and 2015.\n\nAn Albanian couple \u2014 Artan H., 38, and Enkeledja Z., 42, who also holds French citizenship \u2014 also face criminal proceedings. They are suspected of having helped Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel obtain the 7.65-millimeter automatic pistol that he used.\n\nQuestions continued to be raised about security measures in Nice on the night of the attack, which killed not only French citizens who had been celebrating their national holiday, but also people of 19 other nationalities, including citizens of Algeria, Brazil, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Madagascar and the United States.\n\nFrance\u2019s Socialist government has sparred repeatedly with opposing politicians on the right and far right, especially local officials in Nice, over how many national and municipal officers were securing the promenade on the night of the attack and how they were spread out. The national police answer to the state, whereas municipal officers answer to city authorities.\n\nThe newspaper Lib\u00e9ration reported on Thursday that only one municipal police car was positioned at the spot where Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel barreled through and onto the promenade, and it said that although national and city officials had agreed on \u2014 and stuck to \u2014 a security plan for Bastille Day, the government had misrepresented those measures after the attack.\n\nInterior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, while denying that accusation, has ordered an internal police investigation, separate from the continuing judicial one, which will look into the Bastille Day security measures in Nice.\n\nQuestions have also been raised about why the authorities did not position heavy obstacles at the entrances to the promenade\u2019s pedestrian area, to block vehicles from entering.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

They have added vehicular barriers at Paris Plages, an annual event that turns sections of the Seine\u2019s embankments into artificial beaches, and have canceled events like an open-air film festival and a pedestrian day on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday, the French Parliament also passed a bill extending for an additional six months the state of emergency that was declared after the November attacks that killed 130 people in and around Paris. It grants the French authorities extraordinary policing powers, such as the ability to carry out police raids or place people under house arrest without a judge\u2019s authorization.\n\nThe latest extension, which would last until the end of January, would make this state of emergency the longest since the 1950s.\n\nIn addition, legislation passed on Thursday gives the government new powers. For example, under the state of emergency, the police will be allowed to seize computers and phones and copy the data on them without prior judicial authorization. And from now on, the government will be able to place a person returning from Syria or Iraq under house arrest for up to three months instead of one.", "summary": "On Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s phone, investigators found pictures of fireworks and of the Nice promenade from last year, as well as an image of an article about Captagon, an amphetamine that has been associated in some news reports with Islamic State fighters.
