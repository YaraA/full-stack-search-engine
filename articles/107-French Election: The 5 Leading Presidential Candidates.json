He has pitched himself as forward-looking and socially progressive and is running on a free-market, pro-Europe platform. The candidacy of Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, received a lift when the prominent centrist and three-time candidate Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou announced that he would endorse him.\n\nPhoto\n\nMarine Le Pen\n\nAge: 48\n\nParty: National Front (Front National)\n\nPolitical positioning: far right\n\nMs. Le Pen is the daughter and political heir to Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the National Front, a far-right, nationalist, anti-immigration party.\n\nSince becoming head of the party in 2011, she has tried to clean up its xenophobic and anti-Semitic image, leading her to split with her father and then oust him from the party. For years, she has put criticism of globalization and Islam at the center of her platform.\n\nIf elected, she has promised to hold a referendum on a French exit from the European Union. She has led in the opinion polls so far, but pollsters predict she will find it much harder to defeat an opponent in the second round of voting, where mainstream parties often work to prevent the National Front from winning.\n\nPhoto\n\nFran\u00e7ois Fillon\n\nAge: 63\n\nParty: Republican Party (Les R\u00e9publicains)\n\nPolitical positioning: right-wing conservative\n\nMr. Fillon, a former prime minister, is a socially conservative and pro-free-market political veteran who has called for deep cuts in public spending and major changes in the French workplace.\n\nHe wants more controls on immigration, and he has said that Islam threatens traditional French values. Mr. Fillon was accused of embezzling public funds during his time in Parliament, upending a campaign that was, in large part, based on a projected image of probity. He has denied wrongdoing and refused to withdraw from the race.\n\nPhoto\n\nJean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\n\nAge: 65\n\nParty: Rebellious France (La France Insoumise)\n\nPolitical positioning: hard left\n\nMr. M\u00e9lenchon, a onetime Trotskyite and former Socialist politician, left the Socialist Party in 2008 to create the Left Party, backed by the Communist Party. For this year\u2019s presidential run, he created a new political movement, La France Insoumise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA fiery orator, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon has attracted those on the left who were disappointed by the current government\u2019s pro-business policies and hard-line approach to security.\n\nIf elected, he wants to renegotiate European treaties or leave the European Union, reduce working hours and greatly increase public spending to support economic growth. Like Mr. Fillon and Marine Le Pen, he is in favor of working with Russia on international issues like Syria.\n\nPhoto\n\nBeno\u00eet Hamon\n\nAge: 49\n\nParty: Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste)\n\nPolitical positioning: left wing of the Socialist Party\n\nMr. Hamon, a lawmaker and former education minister, left the government when his party shifted its position toward pro-business, austerity policies.\n\nAn outspoken voice of dissent in his fractured party, Mr. Hamon has appealed to young socialist voters with an environmentally friendly, socially liberal platform, putting forth proposals to phase in a universal revenue, legalize marijuana and tax robots.\n\nAlthough Mr. Hamon has secured an alliance with the French Green Party, the field on the left is still divided between him and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, considerably lowering his chances of reaching the second round. The last time a Socialist Party candidate did not make it to the second round was in 2002.", "summary": "She has led in the opinion polls so far, but pollsters predict she will find it much harder to defeat an opponent in the second round of voting, where mainstream parties often work to prevent the National Front from winning.Mr. Fillon, a former prime minister, is a socially conservative and pro-free-market political veteran who has called for deep cuts in public spending and major changes in the French workplace.Mr. Fillon was accused of embezzling public funds during his time in Parliament, upending a campaign that was, in large part, based on a projected image of probity.An outspoken voice of dissent in his fractured party, Mr. Hamon has appealed to young socialist voters with an environmentally friendly, socially liberal platform, putting forth proposals to phase in a universal revenue, legalize marijuana and tax robots.Although Mr. Hamon has secured an alliance with the French Green Party, the field on the left is still divided between him and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, considerably lowering his chances of reaching the second round."}
