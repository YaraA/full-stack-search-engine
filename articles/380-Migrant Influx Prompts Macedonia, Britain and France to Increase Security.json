GERMANY SLOVAK. AUS. HUNG. FRANCE ITALY MACEDONIA 400 MILES\n\nAt the same time, the British and French authorities announced that they would set up a new \u201ccommand and control center\u201d in Calais, the French port at the mouth of the Channel Tunnel, where several thousand migrants live in a makeshift camp, awaiting the chance to smuggle themselves to Britain.\n\nWhile the problems at Calais have disrupted truck drivers and travelers, the images of chaos on the border between two of Europe\u2019s richest nations have highlighted the inability of Europe to deal with the crisis. Indeed, Calais is just one prominent outpost of a situation that German officials have begun to characterize less as an emergency than as the Continent\u2019s new normal.\n\nEurope must act, German leaders say, to distribute refugees from war and persecution more evenly among European nations, while so called \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d \u2014 mostly from impoverished Balkan countries, will be sent home from Germany because they do not qualify for asylum.\n\nYet so far policy makers have struggled to produce a coherent collective response to the challenge, and efforts to agree on quotas for European Union countries to accept refugees have achieved only limited success.\n\nHours after meeting in Calais with his British counterpart, the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, traveled to Berlin for hurriedly scheduled talks with his German colleague, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, who on Wednesday announced that Germany, Europe\u2019s No. 1 power, expects up to 800,000 asylum seekers this year.\n\nGermany has grappled with a rising number of attacks on refugee shelters and arriving migrants. On Thursday, media were full of reports about fighting that broke out at an overcrowded shelter in Suhl in the central German state of Thuringia, injuring at least 17 people, including police officers, refugees and bystanders. About 1,800 people are said to be crowded into a space designed for 1,200.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Macedonia, reports from the border with Greece on Thursday evening suggested that about 1,500 migrants \u2014 many of them Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans \u2014 were stranded between the Greek and Macedonian borders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPrime Minister Nikola Gruevski of Macedonia said that the state of emergency was a \u201ctemporary mechanism\u201d intended to control the flow of migrants \u201cso that they will have more humane transport through Macedonia.\u201d\n\nJust two months ago, the authorities in Macedonia introduced measures to document migrants. At that point, there were 500 to 600 arrivals each day, he said. Now, the number has climbed to 2,500 a day and is likely to continue to increase to 3,000 to 4,000 a day, he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Migrants in the French port have tried to break into the Channel Tunnel and stow away on cars, trucks and trains.\n\nSome efforts to make the crossing have proved fatal, and one migrant even walked most of the 31-mile tunnel, where he avoided being hit by trains but was arrested as he approached Folkestone in Britain.\n\nUnder plans announced after talks in France, British police and border protection forces will work with their French counterparts at a new \u201ccommand and control center\u201d in Calais. The new body will be led by two senior officers, one British and one French, and will try to target those organizing human trafficking.\n\nThe British home secretary, Theresa May, said that the situation in Calais was \u201cthe result of a global migration challenge,\u201d and promised to work with France to ensure that \u201cthe rest of the European Union and the transit and source countries from which migrants are coming are also playing their full part in solving this problem.\u201d\n\nUnder the new agreement, Britain will now spend more on reinforcing the perimeter of the Eurotunnel railhead with tougher fencing, CCTV, floodlighting and infrared detection technology.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExtra search teams, including detection dogs, will be deployed, more mobile French policing units will be added and a security audit will be conducted.\n\nAlthough some British politicians have criticized France for losing control in Calais, Britain\u2019s government has been careful not to do so. Under reciprocal arrangements, British officials conduct passport checks on those crossing the Channel on French soil, before their journey, making them reliant on French cooperation.\n\nFrench officials argue that migrants are attracted to Britain because of its use of the English language, its growing economy and the fact that, because it does not use identity cards, it may be easier to live illegally there.\n\nMeanwhile, the Council of Europe, a human rights organization of 47 member states, criticized Slovakia for saying that it would refuse to accept Muslim migrants.\n\n\u201cRefusing refugees on the grounds of their religion would be a blatant discrimination,\u201d said the Council\u2019s chairman, Thorbjorn Jagland, in a statement."}
