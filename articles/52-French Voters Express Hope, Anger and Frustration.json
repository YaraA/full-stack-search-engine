His choice is below.\n\nThe New York Times asked readers who had posted comments on Facebook about the first round of the election, in which there were 11 candidates, to share their voting intentions for the second round. Many said they planned to reject both candidates, either by abstaining or by casting \u201cblank\u201d votes, a stance that is expected to hurt Mr. Macron\u2019s chances more than Ms. Le Pen\u2019s.\n\nHere is a selection of comments, edited for length and clarity.\n\n\u2018Voting for Marine Le Pen Will Bring France Its Sovereignty\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t vote for Macron. His program is totally empty. Voting for Marine Le Pen will bring France its sovereignty and will stop the massive terrorist attacks through our country.\u201d\n\nNathan Didine, 18, a student in Montpellier.\n\n\u2018Nothing Changes\u2019\n\n\u201cDisgusting! In France, we don\u2019t vote for candidates anymore, but against the National Front. This is the third election we\u2019re doing it. So nothing changes \u2014 always the same faces, the same platforms, and the same evermore liberal system.\u201d\n\nSt\u00e9phanie Laurens, 35, a psychotherapy student in Perpignan and is studying to become a psychotherapist.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018There Is No Freedom of Choice\u2019\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for the kids, really, but there is no choice to be made here because there is no freedom of choice. If we make a decision, it is forced. Putting a gun against someone\u2019s temple and asking them to pick the lesser of two evils is not giving them any choice. This is the situation the (non-Fascist, non-racist) French people are in today.\u201d\n\nSarah Benamar, 22, a student near Paris, had been debating whether to vote. She plans to stay away from the polls on Sunday.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018I Hope People From the Far-Left Will Vote Against Her.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for an alternative. I\u2019m glad the country decided to choose a more moderate candidate to go up against Le Pen, someone who could bring people together. I\u2019m not sure who would have won if M\u00e9lenchon had been up against her. Even though Le Pen came out favorite here, I hope people from the far-left will vote against her.\u201d\n\nG\u00e9raldine John, a 23-year-old trainee journalist in Calais, spoke of her relief that the traditional parties were knocked out in the first round.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2018Better Him Than Le Pen\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Macron has what it takes to be a good president. But better him than Le Pen. We have to choose between different diseases. Hope it won\u2019t be the worst.\u201d\n\nLaila Sahnoune, 43, is a home-care nurse in Al\u00e8s, in the South of France, where the National Front has traditionally done well.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018A Very Hard Choice to Make\u2019\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t recognize my ideas in Macron, who stands as the anti-Le Pen candidate for the second round of the election. Ask someone who voted for social justice, ecological transition and end of financialization to vote for a former banker, who embodies the elite and its neoliberal politics \u2014 that\u2019s a very hard choice to make.\u201d\n\nTiphaine Vanlemmens, 25, who works for a charity in Paris, voted for he far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018I Won\u2019t Be Taking Any Chances\u2019\n\n\u201cI wished we would have had M\u00e9lenchon in the second round, because even though the public figure himself is rather antipathic, his project is the most thought-out regarding environmental issues, wealth redistribution and, generally speaking, long-term thinking.\u201d \u201cSo all in all, I\u2019m a little disappointed that we probably won\u2019t have major changes in the next few years, but at the same time relieved that said changes won\u2019t be for the worst (unless Le Pen wins; but that\u2019s unlikely. I won\u2019t be taking any chances anyway).\u201d\n\nDr. Bruno Greff, 40, who works in Paris said that if Mr. Macron became president, he expected him to continue the current government\u2019s policies. where the previous administration left off.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018I Will Vote Against My Ideals\u2019\n\n\u201cI will vote for Macron, but it also means that I will vote against my ideals, and that I will play the game of big media. Big fortunes want a liberal candidate to perpetuate a policy of austerity, which is profitable to the rich.\u201d\n\nAudrey Cartier, 31, works as a community manager in a sports center in Toulon, France. After the first round, she had planned to stay away from the polls, but finally resolved to vote for Mr. Macron in an effort to prevent a Le Pen victory.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018The Polls Were Right\u2019\n\n\u201cAmazing to see the amount of people ready to stand one to two hours in the queue. Very happy that Macron was elected, that the polls were right, and that Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Beno\u00eet Hamon called upon their voters to vote for Emmanuel Macron.\u201d\n\nSimon Pastor, 18, a student who voted in London.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018Le Pen Is the Enemy\u2019\n\n\u201cI will vomit after I cast the vote, but it is my responsibility to vote for Macron. \u2026 Macron is an adversary, but Le Pen is the enemy.\u201d \u201cBut come May 8,\u201d he added of Mr. Macron, \u201cwe will be his biggest opposition.\u201d\u201d\n\nGuillaume Delarue, a 42-year-old French expat in London who had supported Mr. M\u00e9lenchon. He is married to a teacher of French literature in London and has an 11-year-old daughter."}
