{"title": "Catalonia Independence Bid Pushes Spain Toward Crisis", "authors": ["Raphael Minder"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/world/europe/spain-catalonia-independence.html", "body": "Almost immediately, Catalan and Spanish politicians \u2014 in addition to pointing fingers at each other over potential security lapses \u2014 resumed their sparring over the region\u2019s aspirations.\n\nSeparatist leaders now face fines and suspension from office if they go ahead with the referendum, which has been declared illegal by the central government in Madrid, with the support of Spanish courts.\n\nSome 6,000 ballot boxes have been stored in a secret location for fear that they could be confiscated by the police. The Catalan Parliament has been fast-tracking legislation amid walkouts by unionist lawmakers and objections from the assembly\u2019s own lawyers.\n\nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s resolve stems in part from his successful resistance to Catalan pressure before, including in November 2014, when Catalonia last held a vote on separation.\n\nBut the 2014 vote was a nonbinding consultation. Just under 40 percent of voters turned out, and about 80 percent of those who did voted for independence.\n\nThis time, Catalonia\u2019s government has promised that the referendum will be binding, even if it is declared illegal by Spain\u2019s constitutional court and even if Catalan opponents of independence boycott it.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat has made the current round of the fight significantly riskier.\n\nSeparatism has deep historical and cultural roots in Catalonia, which has a distinct language. Monday\u2019s Catalan national day commemorates a Catalan defeat at the hands of Madrid: the 1714 capture of Barcelona by the troops of Philip V, the first Bourbon monarch of Spain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt one point, Spain\u2019s national lawmakers came close to appeasing Catalan\u2019s nationalist sentiment by allowing the region special autonomy. But when that statute was struck down by Spain\u2019s constitutional court in 2010, the tensions came to the fore.\n\nThe dispute gathered steam during the financial crisis after Mr. Rajoy rejected a plea by Catalonia to reduce its contribution to a Spanish tax system that transfers money from wealthier to poorer areas.\n\nThe move only fueled the sense in Catalonia \u2014 Spain\u2019s most economically powerful region \u2014 that Madrid was unfairly sucking away its wealth.\n\nSpain has emerged from its banking crisis to spearhead Europe\u2019s economic recovery, with a gross domestic product that is expected to grow over 3 percent this year. But that has not curbed the independence drive in Catalonia led by separatist lawmakers who have held a majority in the regional assembly since late 2015.\n\n\u201cHaving better macroeconomic data doesn\u2019t mean people have more to spend and feel better off,\u201d said Josep Borrell, a Catalan economist and a former leader of Spain\u2019s Socialist party.\n\nAs a result, he added, the separatist leitmotif that \u201cSpain robs us\u201d remains a powerful message.\n\nMr. Borrell, however, is among those who have forcefully challenged separatist claims that an independent Catalonia would have a bright economic future.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Madrid says the separatists are undermining democracy by flouting court rulings and violating the constitution.\n\nIn recent days, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government took legal action to ensure that Spain\u2019s judiciary declares null and void the laws that separatist lawmakers have approved before the referendum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Rajoy told Catalonia\u2019s mayors, elected officials and civil servants that their duty was to \u201cprevent or paralyze\u201d an illegal referendum. As Spain\u2019s leader, he added, \u201cI will do everything necessary without giving up anything\u201d to stop secessionism in its tracks.\n\nIn response, Carles Puigdemont, the leader of Catalonia, told Catalan television that no politician or court in Madrid could stop the referendum.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Oct. 1, he predicted, Catalonia will be swept up in \u201ca democratic tsunami,\u201d as its streets fill with citizens casting their vote in favor of independence. Democracy, Mr. Puigdemont argued, is \u201cto listen to citizens,\u201d while Mr. Rajoy is doing \u201canother thing\u201d by threatening punishment, with the support of Spanish judges.\n\nMr. Puigdemont and his colleagues seem prepared to pursue their fight even if it results in their prosecution.\n\nThat is what happened in March to Artur Mas, Catalonia\u2019s former leader, who was fined and barred from holding office for two years after a court found him guilty of organizing the last independence referendum.\n\nThis time the conflict is further complicated by the fragile grip that both Mr. Rajoy and Mr. Puigdemont have on power.\n\nMr. Puigdemont heads a separatist coalition in which his own conservative Convergence party has lost clout, in part because of arguments over secessionism but also because it has been entangled in fraud cases.\n\nMr. Rajoy leads a minority government in Madrid and a conservative Popular Party mired by corruption scandals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo far, Mr. Rajoy has resisted calls by more hard-line elements of his conservative electorate to use emergency powers granted under Spain\u2019s Constitution to seize back administrative control of Catalonia.\n\nBut he has not ruled out such a step, particularly if Mr. Puigdemont\u2019s government declares independence unilaterally.\n\nEither move would be a significant escalation in the standoff.\n\nAt this stage, whether the referendum succeeds or not, Mr. Puigdemont and his fellow separatist politicians have raised expectations of a significant moment.\n\nWin or lose, separatists could still take to the streets, warned Francesc de Carreras, a constitutional lawyer who helped launch Ciudadanos, a party firmly opposed to independence.\n\n\u201cWe should at least be ready for a Catalan version of Maidan,\u201d he said, referring to the square in Kiev that became the center of the Ukrainian revolution in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt could create an even more unpredictable and tense situation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the right to protest must also be respected in a democracy.\u201d"}
