It will take time, effort and money \u2014 especially when it comes to the very important task of integrating those who will be remaining here permanently. Here we want to, and must, learn from the mistakes of the past. Our values, our traditions, our understanding of the law, our language, our rules and regulations \u2014 all of these things undergird our society and are the fundamental requirements for the positive and mutually respectful coexistence of all the people in our country. This applies to everyone who wants to live here. Successful immigration, however, benefits a country \u2014 economically as well as socially.\n\nShe added, \u201cNext year is about one thing in particular: our cohesion,\u201d and then said: \u201cIt is important for us not to let ourselves be divided. Not by generation, and also not socially or into the categories of longtime residents and new residents.\u201d\n\nThat the German leader\u2019s words were made available online with Arabic subtitles by the state broadcaster stirred criticism in Europe and the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is important,\u201d she said, \u201cnot to follow those who, with coldness or even hate in their hearts, want to claim Germanness solely for themselves and exclude others.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel also looked ahead to soccer\u2019s European Championship to be held in France next summer, where Germany will be represented by a world-beating squad featuring German-born stars of Turkish, Ghanaian, Albanian, Tunisian, Polish and Moroccan ancestry.", "summary": "As Germans prepared to ring in 2016 alongside at least a million migrants who were registered as new residents in 2015, Chancellor Angela Merkel dedicated a New Year\u2019s Eve address to what she said her nation could gain from the refugee crisis.
