Their first tweet \u2014 like many that followed \u2014 was aimed at Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Enda Kenny, who has declined to back calls for a referendum on expanding abortion access.\n\n\u201cGood morning all. Thanks for all of the messages of solidarity and support,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThanks to @EndaKennyTD we\u2019re about to hit the road.\u201d\n\nMr. Kenny has not publicly responded to the women\u2019s Twitter campaign, and his office did not respond to an email seeking comment. Ireland\u2019s health minister, Simon Harris, however, thanked the two women in his own Twitter post and said they had raised awareness of a \u201creality which faces many.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s Twitter account has gotten over 26,000 followers since their first tweet was sent on Friday night. But not everyone was supportive. Cora Sherlock, the spokeswoman for Pro Life Campaign Ireland, said on Twitter that she found the women\u2019s social media activity \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d\n\nThe Eighth Amendment to Ireland\u2019s Constitution says a woman and a fetus have an equal right to life. The measure was passed in a referendum in 1983, when the majority-Catholic country was a far more conservative place.\n\nAs a result, the path from Irish airports to British abortion providers is a well-traveled one. At least 3,451 women traveled from Ireland to England or Wales to get an abortion in 2015, according to the British Department of Health. It said at least 833 more went to Britain from Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom that also restricts abortion access.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

At least 165,438 of those went to Britain, it said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe live-tweeters were not the only Irish women who went to England to get abortions over the weekend. They said they went to two clinics on Saturday, one in Manchester and another an hour away in Liverpool, because the first one was too busy to accommodate them. They said they met several other Irish women at both clinics.\n\n\u201cWe were talking to them at the end of the day because we were all waiting for our taxis back,\u201d the companion said. \u201cIf you see a woman on her own in an abortion clinic, the chances are that lonely woman keeping to herself is Irish.\u201d\n\nIreland has changed significantly in recent years. It became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage by popular vote in 2015, and the Roman Catholic Church has lost its once-dominant role, in part because of a series of sexual abuse scandals.\n\n\u201cA lot of the Irish people, and especially Irish women, have shed the church,\u201d the companion said. \u201cThe church is losing its grip, but the government hasn\u2019t caught up to the idea that women need to be freed.\u201d\n\nThe government has been under pressure in recent months to relax its abortion laws, which Amnesty International has called among \u201cthe world\u2019s most discriminatory and punitive.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Savita Halappanavar, 31, a dentist who lived near Galway, died after she was reportedly denied a potentially lifesaving abortion, spurring at least two investigations and reviving the debate over Ireland\u2019s ban on most abortions.\n\nIn June, Ireland was criticized by a United Nations panel that said its policies amounted to cruel, degrading and discriminatory treatment of women. That same month, it agreed to hold a \u201ccitizens\u2019 assembly\u201d to study the issue by October, but critics said the proposal was not enough.\n\n\u201cThe Irish state is failing women and the tweets from @twowomentravel highlight this,\u201d Louise O\u2019Reilly, an opposition politician, said in an email. \u201cThe issue of a referendum to repeal the 8th amendment needs to be addressed head on.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe woman had the abortion on Saturday, and on Sunday the pair live-tweeted their return journey to Ireland. It began with a lightly bloodstained sheet in a Manchester hotel room.\n\nThe woman\u2019s companion said on Sunday that they were relieved to have the trip behind them, but that they thought it was wrong they had to make the journey in the first place.\n\n\u201cAbortion is a very difficult thing for any woman to have to go through and to say that traveling to another country doesn\u2019t make it any easier would be a gross understatement, to say the least,\u201d she said."}
