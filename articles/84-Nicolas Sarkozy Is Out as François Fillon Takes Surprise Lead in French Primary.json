{"title": "Nicolas Sarkozy Is Out as Fran\u00e7ois Fillon Takes Surprise Lead in French Primary", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/world/europe/francois-fillon-nicolas-sarkozy-france-election.html", "body": "But in the past week, Mr. Fillon advanced in the polls, having positioned himself between the integrationist message of Mr. Jupp\u00e9 and the tougher positions of Mr. Sarkozy. On Sunday night, French television commentators expressed astonishment that the longtime favorite, Mr. Jupp\u00e9, had suddenly become a challenger with tough odds.\n\nThe winner of the second round is likely to face the candidate of France\u2019s far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, in the presidential election. On Sunday, Ms. Le Pen boasted that the Republicans\u2019 primary had been fought on her themes: French identity, reconsideration of France\u2019s role in Europe, and a crackdown on immigration and jihadists.\n\nThose themes are likely to dominate electioneering here. For the next week, Mr. Fillon and Mr. Jupp\u00e9 will be seeking Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s voters. Mr. Fillon has promised to add 16,000 prison cells, create a special antiterrorism judicial unit, crack down harshly on anybody who maintains any relation with the Islamic State, and strip the French citizenship of those who embark on jihad.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the two have a similar outlook on the world, and in particular a more conciliatory approach than Mr. Jupp\u00e9 to the Russia led by Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Fillon has called for a Western coalition with Mr. Putin, the Russian president, to fight ISIS.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, a large majority of voters said in exit polls on Sunday that economic issues were of uppermost concern, and on that subject, Mr. Fillon could be vulnerable. He has promised harsh measures \u2014 in the French context \u2014 to roll back the role of the state in the country\u2019s economy: cutting 500,000 to 600,000 civil service positions, eliminating the 35-hour workweek, and moving to a 39-hour workweek in state workplaces like hospitals. These kinds of campaign planks typically bring tens of thousands of demonstrators into the streets \u2014 as Mr. Jupp\u00e9 learned at his expense in the mid-1990s \u2014 and bring down governments.\n\nMr. Jupp\u00e9 has criticized Mr. Fillon\u2019s economic program as far too harsh, and unworkable. He seems certain to hammer that theme in the seven days remaining in the primary campaign. But the odds may now be against him.\n\n\u201cFillon will win,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a political scientist at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, who added that a week ago, he would not have predicted Mr. Fillon\u2019s swift rise.\n\n\u201cJupp\u00e9 campaigned too far to the left for the French right,\u201d Mr. Grunberg said. Referring to Mr. Fillon, he added, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would all crystallize around his personality.\u201d", "summary": "On Sunday night, French television commentators expressed astonishment that the longtime favorite, Mr. Jupp\u00e9, had suddenly become a challenger with tough odds.
