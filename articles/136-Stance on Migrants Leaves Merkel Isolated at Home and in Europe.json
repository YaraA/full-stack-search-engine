{"title": "Stance on Migrants Leaves Merkel Isolated at Home and in Europe", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/world/europe/stance-on-migrants-leaves-merkel-isolated-at-home-and-in-europe.html", "body": "This week, a lengthening string of allies at home and abroad abandoned her on the issue, including neighboring Austria, which said it would set a cap of accepting 37,500 migrants this year \u2014 less than half the 90,000 it received in 2015.\n\nSo far, while promising a \u201cpalpable reduction\u201d in asylum seekers this year, Ms. Merkel has refused growing demands \u2014 most prominently by Germany\u2019s president on Wednesday \u2014 to set a limit.\n\nThat insistence has left the chancellor irrevocably associated with a policy on refugees that has sown enormous disquiet, even anger, both in Germany for the financial costs and cultural clashes it has invited, and across Europe, where the Continent\u2019s cherished system of open borders now verges on collapse.\n\nThe difference with other crises, the leading liberal daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung noted on Thursday, \u201cis that this time it concerns the chancellor. Above all, the chancellor.\u201d\n\nWhile Ms. Merkel is likely to survive politically \u2014 unseating a chancellor is immensely complex, and there are no obvious alternative candidates \u2014 the anger and rebellion she faces are rare in Germany\u2019s orderly politics, and a watershed in her political life.\n\nMost dangerous for the chancellor: Her weakened position leaves her with narrowing room to maneuver on the refugee issue and reduces her leverage with unhappy European partners.\n\nThat is so even as European Union leaders increasingly sound the alarm that time is running out to forge a strong policy on borders and migration before the surge of refugees resumes in the spring from wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan that show no signs of abating.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis week, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, warned, \u201cWe have no more than two months to get things under control\u201d \u2014 a relative blink in the bloc\u2019s sluggish decision-making. Short of that, Mr. Tusk told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the union would \u201cfail as a political project.\u201d\n\nIn previous crises, in particular over a third debt-relief package for Greece last year, Berlin could count on support from other Europeans. On the euro and Ukraine crises, Ms. Merkel was \u201can indispensable leader,\u201d said Jan Techau of Carnegie Europe, a Brussels think tank.\n\nVideo\n\nOn migration, however, Ms. Merkel\u2019s allies have been chagrined by what they see as her flip-flopping as it suits her, Mr. Techau said. Ms. Merkel first defended the European Union practice of trying to turn back or intercept migrants \u201cwhen it was undefendable, and gave it up when it didn\u2019t suit the Germans any longer,\u201d Mr. Techau noted. As a result, he said, \u201cshe is not as strong as she used to be.\u201d\n\nNow Germany stands increasingly alone in the migrant crisis, exemplified by Austria\u2019s decision this week to set a cap, which Ms. Merkel\u2019s government called \u201cnot helpful.\u201d\n\nThat was an understatement in a week in which conservative lawmakers signed two open letters balking at Ms. Merkel\u2019s refusal to similarly set a cap, and the transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, became the first cabinet member to openly criticize her policy as questionable for Europe.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Without acceptance, a society is not open and willing to take in refugees.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Mr. Gauck warned, \u201cif democrats refuse to talk about limits, they leave the field to populists and xenophobes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat warning was clearly a nod to the Pegida movement and the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, which has risen in polls well above the 5 percent threshold that secures representation in Parliament, said Josef Joffe, publisher of the weekly Die Zeit, who was at the forum.\n\nHe viewed Mr. Gauck\u2019s speech as both a caution and an attempt to throw a political lifeline to the chancellor, whose conservative Bavarian allies and center-left Social Democratic coalition partners have distanced themselves from her.\n\n\u201cWithout mentioning Angela Merkel, and while maintaining very polite, statesmanlike language, he essentially told her, \u2018This has got to stop,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Joffe said in a telephone interview.\n\nMs. Stelzenm\u00fcller of the Brookings Institution, in a separate interview, concurred with Mr. Joffe\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u201cHe is trying to build a bridge,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Gauck, \u201cover what many in the media see as an increasingly unbridgeable chasm between a high-minded chancellor, who is demanding the impossible, and institutions buckling under the strain.\u201d\n\nIt is not only Germany that could buckle, but the European Union itself. While Ms. Merkel, as ever, insists on the need for a European solution to the migrant crisis, time is not on the side of the bloc\u2019s cumbersome policy-making apparatus.\n\nThis week, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, warned that he, too, was \u201crather worried that we won\u2019t have enough time to tackle the refugee question in sufficient depth.\u201d He called on European Union leaders to devote more time to the issue at their next summit meeting in mid-February, when the agenda is expected to be dominated by how to keep Britain from abandoning the bloc.\n\nMs. Merkel has acknowledged that the union\u2019s lack of unity on the migrant problem leaves the Continent vulnerable. But for the embattled chancellor, urgency may take second place to the imperative of navigating political troubles at home.\n\nHer government will present more proposals to tackle the refugee crisis at the next summit meeting, she said on Wednesday, \u201cthen we can draw another interim conclusion, and then we will see where we stand.\u201d", "summary": "This week, a lengthening string of allies at home and abroad abandoned her on the issue, including neighboring Austria, which said it would set a cap of accepting 37,500 migrants this year \u2014 less than half the 90,000 it received in 2015.That insistence has left the chancellor irrevocably associated with a policy on refugees that has sown enormous disquiet, even anger, both in Germany for the financial costs and cultural clashes it has invited, and across Europe, where the Continent\u2019s cherished system of open borders now verges on collapse.That is so even as European Union leaders increasingly sound the alarm that time is running out to forge a strong policy on borders and migration before the surge of refugees resumes in the spring from wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan that show no signs of abating.Ms. Merkel first defended the European Union practice of trying to turn back or intercept migrants \u201cwhen it was undefendable, and gave it up when it didn\u2019t suit the Germans any longer,\u201d Mr. Techau noted.That warning was clearly a nod to the Pegida movement and the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, which has risen in polls well above the 5 percent threshold that secures representation in Parliament, said Josef Joffe, publisher of the weekly Die Zeit, who was at the forum."}
