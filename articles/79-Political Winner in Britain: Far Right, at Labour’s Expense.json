{"title": "Political Winner in Britain: Far Right, at Labour\u2019s Expense", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/world/europe/to-remake-britains-labour-party-jeremy-corbyn-might-kill-it.html", "body": "But Mr. Corbyn will not resign, instead arguing that he has a democratic mandate from party members and supporters, who he is convinced will re-elect him.\n\nThat is Labour\u2019s quandary. Its lawmakers seek to be an effective opposition and governing alternative to the Conservatives. To deliver policies for their constituents and the country, they must win power, and they see that goal fading fast under Mr. Corbyn.\n\nAfter the so-called Brexit referendum, Labour leaders cited a poll that the party conducted suggesting that 29 percent of the voters who favored Labour in the last election 13 months ago would not do so again.\n\nBut Mr. Corbyn has a longer-term goal than simply achieving power: the transformation of the party into a revolutionary social movement of the working class and the dispossessed, the dream that brought him into politics.\n\nIf that ambition requires the sacrifice of many of Labour\u2019s seats in Parliament, they would be acceptable collateral damage to bring about a fundamental shift in the party toward the hard left.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Corbyn and his top aides \u2014 the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and Seumas Milne, a former columnist for The Guardian \u2014 have threatened to remove legislators who oppose Mr. Corbyn. They would require all sitting legislators to be selected again by party members in their local constituencies before standing in another election. Mr. Corbyn and his allies have also discussed changing party rules to strip legislators of their party leadership powers and put members in full control.\n\nMr. Corbyn has never changed his views, which are essentially pacifist and Marxist. And the Labour Party he represented in 1983 was a trade-union-dominated Socialist party, committed to unilateral nuclear disarmament and \u201cthe common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOver the years, the party moved toward the center, most notably under the last Labour prime minister to win an election (let alone three), Tony Blair.\n\nMr. Corbyn has expressed contempt for Mr. Blair\u2019s centrist politics, which those on the hard left consider little different from the Conservatives, or \u201cTory-lite.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And since the last general election in May 2015, more than 187,000 people joined Labour, bringing total membership to about 390,000, a remarkable increase.\n\nPassionate and committed, they may be enough to re-elect Mr. Corbyn as party leader despite the opposition of the party\u2019s members of Parliament. But as the internal party poll indicated, they are not nearly committed enough to win a general election in Britain. The retreat of Labour from the center ground of British politics is likely to cost the party dearly.\n\nEven more troubling for Labour, many of the working-class voters in Britain are not attracted to theoretical or academic socialism. They are angry about immigration and competition for jobs from Europeans with skills and a willingness to work for less money.\n\nMany traditional Labour voters are moving in droves toward the far right \u2014 to UKIP and Mr. Farage.\n\nThis is exactly what has happened to the Socialist Party in France, where workers who have been hurt by unemployment and globalization are voting for Marine Le Pen and the far-right National Front, not for the left.\n\nYvette Cooper, who lost the leadership post to Mr. Corbyn last time, and who is likely to run against him again, said that the problem was not just Mr. Corbyn\u2019s administrative incompetence and lack of leadership. \u201cHe is losing us Labour support across the country \u2014 and particularly in the towns and coal fields that built the labor movement in the first place,\u201d Ms. Cooper said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Sunderland, in northeast England, which is Labour country, voters overwhelmingly decided to quit the European Union.\n\n\u201cThis area is traditionally Labour, but we\u2019re disappointed by Corbyn,\u201d said Michael Wake, a forklift operator. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like a politician, he looks like some hitchhiker.\u201d\n\nGlenn Crawford, a Labour voter, said that \u201cCorbyn is a nice man, it\u2019s nice to have him on a college debate. But he\u2019s not a leader.\u201d\n\nAlan Liddle, 44, now votes for UKIP. \u201cI lost faith in Labour,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to represent the working class.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment was amplified by John Hall, who said: \u201cWe\u2019re fed up with Labour. They\u2019re out of touch with the working class.\u201d\n\nMr. Farage, however, with a message straight out of the National Front of Ms. Le Pen \u2014 anti-elitist, nationalist, anti-immigration, anti-Europe \u2014 is reaping the failure of mainstream parties to speak to the concerns and vulnerabilities of the poor and the shrinking working class.", "summary": "But Mr. Corbyn has a longer-term goal than simply achieving power: the transformation of the party into a revolutionary social movement of the working class and the dispossessed, the dream that brought him into politics.
