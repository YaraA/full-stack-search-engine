That thesis is speculative, too, and will be tested next month in France, where the traditional parties have imploded and the far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen, if victorious, has promised to take France out of the European Union. But for now, Emmanuel Macron, who is pro-Europe, is leading the polls.\n\nPhoto\n\nPicking winners at such a volatile moment is perilous, but many analysts agree that the British withdrawal, and the uncertainty it produced, has been good news for Russia, and possibly for China, as two large powers that can exercise greater leverage in negotiations with individual European capitals than with a tightly unified European bloc that, taken together, is a geopolitical powerhouse.\n\n\u201c \u2018Brexit\u2019 surely strengthens the disintegrative processes already underway in the E.U., and therefore is a boon\u201d to Russia, said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. \u201cThe E.U. is more powerful than any single actor, even Germany, so anything that diminishes a rival in the zero-sum terms in which Russia thinks strengthens the Russian voice in Europe.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s absence at the European table could also help the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Partly pressed by Britain, the United States\u2019 main ally, the European Union has been tough on Russia over its annexation of Crimea, and the bloc has moved to cut Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian natural gas. Anything that shifts power in Brussels away from that Anglo-Saxon view is considered a plus for Moscow.\n\nThe coming exit from the European Union has already turned Britain inward, with the government and the country\u2019s powerful tabloid news media fixated on the particulars of its withdrawal: the uncertainties of whether the country will maintain access to the bloc\u2019s single market; demands that the country take control of its borders to stunt immigration; and an insistence on \u201creclaiming sovereignty\u201d by returning lawmaking powers to London.\n\nThose themes of national sovereignty and curbing immigration resonate across the Continent, which is why some saw the British exit as a political precursor and the European Union as an endangered species.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn December, however, Austrians narrowly elected a pro-European president, Alexander Van der Bellen, over Norbert Hofer of the far-right Freedom Party. In Spain, the populist Podemos party underperformed polling expectations last year and the conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, stayed in office.\n\nThis month, the Dutch gave the far-right anti-European politician Geert Wilders fewer votes than expected in a northern European country similar in its political outlook to Britain. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel remains popular in the polls, although weakened by her long service in the job and by severe criticism of her 2015 \u201copen-door\u201d immigration policy. The anti-euro, anti-immigration Alternative for Deutschland is slipping, however, and Ms. Merkel\u2019s main challenger is the pro-European Martin Schulz of the Social Democrats, the former head of the European Parliament.\n\nEven Bulgaria, the European Union country considered most influenced by Russia, saw voters endorse the pro-Europe, center-right party in elections last weekend.\n\nVideo\n\nAs European voters seem to be tentatively endorsing unity, Britain is confronted with widening divisions. On Tuesday, less than 24 hours before the exit letter was delivered to Brussels, the Scottish Parliament voted to demand a new referendum on independence from the United Kingdom. Such a referendum is unlikely to happen anytime soon \u2014 it requires the approval of the British government in Westminster \u2014 but the rising nationalism in Scotland is a reminder that London could get a taste of its own medicine.\n\nWith her government desperate to maintain Britain\u2019s standing in the world, Mrs. May has turned to President Trump. He and his chief political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, are deeply skeptical of multilateralism, free trade and \u201centangling alliances.\u201d While NATO may pass muster as a security shield (provided everyone pays up), the European Union, like the United Nations, seems an example of the world that Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon want to dismantle or, at the very least, weaken.\n\nYet Mrs. May has also tried to present Britain as committed to globalization and to global trade \u2014 as, effectively, still open for business. It is a tricky circle to square, demonstrating how difficult it is to predict Britain\u2019s future. Some envision the country\u2019s fate as being a European equivalent of Singapore, sovereign and respected, a partner eagerly sought by the rest of the world. Others warn that Britain could be left much more isolated than it is now, especially since European leaders feel they must strike a hard bargain.\n\n\u201cThere is a political imperative that \u2018Brexit\u2019 not be seen as a success,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cbecause every government in Europe is challenged to some degree by resurgent nationalists who would be encouraged and inspired by a \u2018Brexit\u2019 success.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor those British lawmakers in favor of the withdrawal, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative legislator, the exit \u201cis a wonderful liberation for my country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe single market, he told Prospect magazine, \u201cis a bureaucratic, highly regulated means of making British business more inefficient \u2014 it\u2019s about having a closed, inward-looking Fortress Europe approach, rather than engaging with the world.\u201d\n\nThere is \u201cno political event in my lifetime that has been better or more exciting for the nation,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Mr. Leonard has his doubts.\n\n\u201cBritain may be sailing off to sea,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the welcoming arms won\u2019t be that numerous.\u201d"}
