The interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, has said that applicants will be judged case by case, adding that \u201cnot all of the people who come to us as refugees from Afghanistan can expect to stay in Germany.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Germany also note that the country has had troops in Afghanistan for 14 years and has poured more than 2 billion euros, or about $2.15 billion, into civilian projects. Chancellor Angela Merkel has suggested that those efforts fulfill Germany\u2019s commitment to care for those in need, meaning it should not necessarily have to shelter Afghans in Germany, too.\n\nThat tougher stance by Germany is emerging as the biggest test case yet of Central and Northern Europe\u2019s willingness to absorb people from the world\u2019s most troubled regions. At the same time, it may force a debate over who qualifies as a refugee.\n\n\u201cLife in Afghanistan is worsening, and the fighting is increasing,\u201d Mr. Atti said. \u201cThere is the Taliban. There is ISIS. It is very bad,\u201d he added, referring to the militant group also known as the Islamic State or ISIL.\n\nGermany\u2019s own Foreign Ministry \u201curgently warns\u201d against travel to Afghanistan.\n\nMelissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency, said that some of the Afghan migrants might be leaving for a better life in Europe\u2019s most prosperous countries, but that for many, \u201cit is well documented that these are extremely dangerous situations\u201d that they face living in Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries on earth.\n\nAt the same time, Afghanistan\u2019s sophisticated networks of smugglers appear to have accelerated their operations, capitalizing on growing fears over advances by the Taliban and inroads by the Islamic State.\n\nPhoto\n\nAbout 67,000 Afghans have entered Germany seeking asylum this year, almost half of them last month alone, officials said. Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re, the interior minister, has said the arrival of so many members of Afghanistan\u2019s middle class is \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are in agreement with the Afghan government,\u201d he said, of concerns that Afghanistan\u2019s population would be depleted of future leaders. \u201cWe do not want that.\u201d\n\nAfghan migrants in Germany said they were already feeling the effects of the government\u2019s harder line.\n\nOn Thursday, Sayed Aliraza, 24, was among the thousands of new arrivals waiting in Berlin\u2019s main migrant reception center, hoping to appeal what he said had been his rejection from German-language classes.\n\nMr. Aliraza said he had broken off his studies of law and politics in his third year at Kabul University and left for Europe in April with his parents, brother, sister-in-law and their five children.\n\nHe said he was in his third day of seeking redress from a Berlin bureaucracy severely strained by the migrant influx, to present a paper he said showed approval to start the classes. He said the government, which insists newcomers learn German, was no longer helping Afghans.\n\n\u201cI think the German government does not want for Afghan people to learn Deutsch,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand \u2014 the government of Germany doesn\u2019t have place for refugees. But we are also human.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any security there,\u201d he added, referring to Afghanistan. \u201cThat is the reality. Afghanistan is not secure, and the government of Germany knows this.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He had been on the road for 30 days.\n\nAs a Hazara, a Shiite Muslim ethnic minority targeted by the Taliban, who are Sunni, Mr. Mohammed had been threatened many times, he said. \u201cThe Taliban would have killed me if I remained, I am certain of it,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis dream, he said, is Germany, but he will try Sweden instead.\n\nAfter more than four years of war in Syria and a recent bombing campaign by Russia in support of President Bashar al-Assad, more Syrians than Afghans continue to enter Greece, though the pace from Syria has dropped slightly.\n\nIn September, 110,512 Syrians entered Greece, according to the Hellenic Coast Guard, but the tally decreased to 90,718 in October. Over the same period, the number of Afghans more than doubled to 64,000, according to the United Nations.\n\nAfter 35 years of war, Afghanistan is a leading source of refugees. Afghans began arriving in Europe in significant numbers as the Taliban took hold in the 1990s, and in 2001 they were the single largest group arriving on the Continent, according to the United Nations refugee group. The International Organization for Migration estimated that 260,000 Afghans were on the Continent from 2010 to 2012.\n\nAnd because Afghanistan is also the world\u2019s leading opium producer, finding a smuggler is easy. They are waiting at border crossings to Iran, where busloads of Afghan migrants arrive daily to begin a journey they hope will end in Europe. Or one can get a referral to a smuggler at Kabul\u2019s pre-eminent mall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGermany\u2019s hardening stance on the Afghan migrants comes as discontent over the open-door migration policy of Ms. Merkel\u2019s government deepens. The giddy joy that greeted the migrants when they started pouring into rail stations in early September is giving way to a dreary exhaustion as cities and towns struggle to accommodate thousands of people who do not share a common culture, language or religion \u2014 and who must be protected before the winter sets in.\n\nUnder political pressure, the government has tightened some of its policies, adopting measures to weed out new arrivals who are unlikely to qualify for asylum and limiting asylum-seekers\u2019 ability to bring additional family members. Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re, who bore the brunt of the criticism for being unprepared for the migrants\u2019 arrival, has raised the issue of the Afghan migrants several times in recent weeks.\n\nHis criticisms appear to have taken hold in German society, highlighted by a recent article in the mass-circulation newspaper Bild that raised questions about Afghans\u2019 claims of personal danger, a condition of asylum. Bild said its reporter had found fake Taliban death sentences, meant to reinforce false claims of personal threat, selling for \u20ac1,000 in Kabul.\n\nGermany is balking at looking after Afghans on both ends. Since German troops were first deployed to Afghanistan in 2001, in post-9/11 solidarity with the United States, 54 German soldiers have been killed, the biggest toll of any German deployment abroad since 1945.\n\nNoting that American, German and other forces will now stay beyond 2016, Ms. Merkel has argued that that commitment \u2014 as well as more aid \u2014 can give Afghans \u201cmore possibility to build up their country.\u201d\n\nMohamed al Zoda, 20, a Hazara from Baghlan Province at the main migrant center in Berlin, said he did not buy Ms. Merkel\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cThe case here is that our government is bribed,\u201d he said, sitting among a group of young Afghan men at the center last week. \u201cThey are not good guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cForeign countries give aid,\u201d he added, but the government \u201cgets the money and put it in their pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do not have any solutions for people,\u201d he said.", "summary": "But after a month of harrowing travel, rushing to reach Central and Northern Europe before more borders are closed, the Afghan migrants may be facing a new obstacle to their dreams of safety and security: a hardening stance by the German government on who gets to stay for a year, or more.The unwelcome message does not appear to have fully trickled into Afghanistan itself, although migrants arriving in Greece last week expressed a growing sense that they had more to worry about than the possible closing of borders or the hardships of travel.The giddy joy that greeted the migrants when they started pouring into rail stations in early September is giving way to a dreary exhaustion as cities and towns struggle to accommodate thousands of people who do not share a common culture, language or religion \u2014 and who must be protected before the winter sets in.Under political pressure, the government has tightened some of its policies, adopting measures to weed out new arrivals who are unlikely to qualify for asylum and limiting asylum-seekers\u2019 ability to bring additional family members.His criticisms appear to have taken hold in German society, highlighted by a recent article in the mass-circulation newspaper Bild that raised questions about Afghans\u2019 claims of personal danger, a condition of asylum."}
