M. Berger, a terrorism analyst and co-author of \u201cISIS: The State of Terror.\u201d \u201cYou may feel you can talk to a sibling about matters you can\u2019t discuss with others.\u201d\n\nThe same dynamics that inform any sibling relationship are at play among brothers who radicalize, experts said. It is often the older brother who influences the younger one, though not always: At Charlie Hebdo, investigators believe, the younger brother, Ch\u00e9rif, was the more militant.\n\nIn the case of the Boston Marathon bombers, who were from a Chechen immigrant family, investigators found a complex dynamic. To all outward appearance, Dzhokhar, a college student, was far better integrated into American life, and more sociable, than his glum, troubled older brother, Tamerlan, who died in a shootout with the police after the bombing.\n\nPhoto\n\nDefense lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev tried to portray him as being bullied by his older brother to participate in the plot, but a Massachusetts jury rejected that argument and recommended the death penalty.\n\nMia Bloom, co-author of \u201cAll in the Family: A Primer on Terrorist Siblings,\u201d cited scholarly research showing that as many as a third of the people terror groups send to carry out attacks came from the same family. Examples abound of jihadists marrying a sister or daughter to another jihadist family in order to build alliances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThese groups are always worried about infiltration,\u201d Ms. Bloom said. \u201cWhen a family member tried to join, it\u2019s a great vetting mechanism. Then they know they can trust them.\u201d\n\nIn carrying out an operation, siblings sometimes work in tandem. The Kouachi brothers burst into the Charlie Hebdo offices together. On Sept. 11, the three pairs of Saudi siblings initially sat side by side aboard the airliners that hit the World Trade towers and the Pentagon. The national 9/11 commission reported that one of them, Nawaf al-Hazmi, had pleaded with Osama bin Laden to let his younger brother Salem join the mission, and they ended up in the fifth row of American Airlines Flight 77 bound for Washington.\n\nBut Ms. Bloom said her research showed that siblings were often purposely sent to different locations, as with the Abdeslam brothers in Paris (Salah drove a fellow plotter to the soccer stadium; Ibrahim detonated a suicide vest at a cafe).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

When sent to different locations, she added, \u201cThey will each go through with it because they do not want to disappoint their sibling and they cannot face the idea of going on without them.\u201d\n\nThe Belgian authorities said on Wednesday that Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, 29, set off one of the two bombs at the airport, and his brother Khalid, 27, the one at the subway station more than an hour later; it remains unclear whether Khalid was first at the airport.\n\nIn her study, Ms. Bloom identified a similar case of Chechen suicide bombers in Russia in 2004: Amanat Nagayeva blew herself up on a flight from Moscow to Volgograd, killing everyone on board; a week later, her sister Rosa killed herself and 10 other people outside the Rishkaya subway station in Moscow.\n\nLaw enforcement officials are puzzling over how to detect terror cells within a family.\n\n\u201cOur traditional counterterror capabilities were designed to pick up the communications and interaction between an attacker and the command and control structure of the organization,\u201d said John Cohen, who until 2014 served as the counterterrorism coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security and is now a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers University.\n\nPsychologists who study terrorism say that the two-person cell may be a recent adaptation to increased security measures \u2014 whether they are brothers, as in Brussels, Paris and Boston, or husband and wife, as in the San Bernardino, Calif., attacks in December that killed 14.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s powerful about these pairs is that they increase capacity for doing damage but not the vulnerability to detection, because of the tightness of the tie,\u201d said Clark McCauley, a research professor at Bryn Mawr College who has studied radical groups. \u201cIt\u2019s a creative solution; you get more hands to help than a lone wolf, but the same kind of security.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRadical groups through history have long included siblings, lovers and friends, whether the Symbionese Liberation Army in California, the Weather Underground, the Marxist Red Brigades in Italy, or the Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany.\n\nIn those larger groups, experts say, members try to one-up each other, pushing the group to endorse ever more violent action. This dynamic is most likely muted in sibling or relative pairs, but the more radical member still often pulls the other along, Dr. McCauley said, especially if they feel imminent threat.\n\nProsecutors in Belgium announced on Wednesday that they had found a suicide note, or will, that one of the brothers, Ibrahim, had left on his computer, saying he was in a \u201cbad situation\u201d and risked arrest, after the authorities caught Salah Abdeslam on Friday. Ariel Merari, an Israeli scholar thought to have interviewed more terrorists than anyone, has described this sensation of urgency a \u201c10 minutes to midnight feeling\u201d \u2014 in other words: time to act.\n\nExperts are still examining how often uninvolved family members may be aware of terrorist\u2019 plotting. A 2014 study in The Journal of Forensic Sciences analyzed the behaviors of 119 \u201clone-wolf\u201d terrorists and found that in nearly two thirds of the cases, family and friends knew the person wanted to commit an act of violence. But in some cases, relatives are strongly opposed: The American terrorist known as the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, for instance, was finally caught and convicted because his brother, David, alerted the authorities to his suspicions.\n\nLittle is yet known about the relationship between the Bakraouis, who are of Moroccan origin and grew up in Laeken, a working-class neighborhood in Brussels, not far from the Royal Palace. Their father, Jamal el-Bakraoui, is an observant Muslim and a retired butcher, according to Marcelline Mertens, a neighbor.\n\nMs. Mertens recalled the brothers as ordinary teenagers, not especially religious, who then disappeared from the neighborhood about five or six years ago. During this period, they were separately convicted of crimes including carjacking and engaging in a shootout with the police.\n\nMs. Bloom, the author who estimated that up to 30 percent of members of terror groups share family ties, warned that extremists were now trying to recruit entire families in Europe, portending the possibility of yet another evolution in jihadism. \u201cRight now, we are seeing a lot of siblings carrying out these attacks,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trend we are anticipating is parent and child.\u201d", "summary": "The national 9/11 commission reported that one of them, Nawaf al-Hazmi, had pleaded with Osama bin Laden to let his younger brother Salem join the mission, and they ended up in the fifth row of American Airlines Flight 77 bound for Washington.But Ms. Bloom said her research showed that siblings were often purposely sent to different locations, as with the Abdeslam brothers in Paris (Salah drove a fellow plotter to the soccer stadium; Ibrahim detonated a suicide vest at a cafe).Psychologists who study terrorism say that the two-person cell may be a recent adaptation to increased security measures \u2014 whether they are brothers, as in Brussels, Paris and Boston, or husband and wife, as in the San Bernardino, Calif., attacks in December that killed 14.Radical groups through history have long included siblings, lovers and friends, whether the Symbionese Liberation Army in California, the Weather Underground, the Marxist Red Brigades in Italy, or the Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany.Prosecutors in Belgium announced on Wednesday that they had found a suicide note, or will, that one of the brothers, Ibrahim, had left on his computer, saying he was in a \u201cbad situation\u201d and risked arrest, after the authorities caught Salah Abdeslam on Friday."}
