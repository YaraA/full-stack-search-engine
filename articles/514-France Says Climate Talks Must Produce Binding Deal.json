Our position has not changed: The U.S. is pressing for an agreement that contains both legally binding and non-legally binding provisions.\u201d\n\nThe disagreement highlighted the uncomfortable fit between American politics and international law. A treaty requires ratification by two-thirds of the Senate, a threshold that is nearly impossible to achieve given the current gridlock in Washington. To bypass the Senate, Mr. Kerry and other officials have had to ensure that whatever deal emerges in Paris is not formally considered a treaty under American law.", "summary": "In an interview with The Financial Times on Wednesday, the secretary of state, John Kerry, said that the agreement was \u201cdefinitively not going to be a treaty\u201d and that although it would push for a significant amount of investment to support low-carbon economies, there were \u201cnot going to be legally binding reduction targets like Kyoto.\u201d The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, speaking on the sidelines of the summit meeting in Malta, which focused on migration, described Mr. Kerry\u2019s choice of words as unfortunate.
