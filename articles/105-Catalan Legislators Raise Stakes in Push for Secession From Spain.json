The vote is unlikely to yield a clear-cut winner, according to the most recent opinion polls, with Mr. Rajoy and his Popular Party holding a small lead that would be insufficient to keep their parliamentary majority.\n\nMr. Mas, too, is fighting for political survival. He and his Convergence Party have been tainted by corruption scandals, and Mr. Mas is supposed to face a vote on his leadership of Catalonia by Thursday. Yet he is struggling to garner sufficient support from lawmakers. One separatist party that voted in favor of the resolution opposes his re-election.\n\nVideo\n\nShould he not get sufficient support, the main separatist coalition can either present an alternative candidate or try to prolong the internal negotiations over its leadership until Jan. 9, the deadline for a new Catalan regional president to take office or for new regional elections to be called.\n\nAddressing the Catalan Parliament on Monday, Mr. Mas called on fellow separatists to unite in the \u201cgigantic\u201d challenge of forming a new nation.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to create a new country,\u201d Mr. Mas said. Catalonia, he argued, has reached a crossroads, facing a choice between \u201csubordination and freedom.\u201d\n\nThe resolution approved on Monday calls for Catalonia to become an independent republic, a goal that Mr. Mas and other separatists aim to achieve within 18 months. Most controversially, the resolution includes a defiant claim that Catalonia\u2019s march toward nationhood need not be subject to approval by Spanish institutions or the country\u2019s Constitutional Court.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent days, Mr. Rajoy has met with other national party leaders in order to present a common front against Catalonia\u2019s separatist ambitions. While Spain\u2019s other main parties want Catalonia to remain within Spain, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s rivals in next month\u2019s general election have blamed Mr. Rajoy for allowing the secessionist drive to reach such a precipitous point.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMonday\u2019s vote followed regional elections in September that gave separatist parties the most parliamentary seats, but denied them a majority of the votes. The fact that 48 percent of votes went to separatist parties was hailed by Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government as proof that separatism was not backed by most of the region\u2019s 7.5 million citizens.\n\nStill, the separatist declaration was approved by 72 to 63. The separatists who voted in favor included those of a far-left party known by its Catalan acronym of CUP, which wants to remove Mr. Mas as regional leader.\n\nMr. Mas did not address CUP\u2019s concerns about his leadership directly on Monday. Instead, he sought to portray himself as the victim of persecution by Madrid. He was recently forced to appear in court over an independence vote in Catalonia a year ago that was also struck down by Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court.\n\n\u201cWho wants to live in a state that prosecutes criminally somebody who promotes the ballot boxes?\u201d Mr. Mas said."}
