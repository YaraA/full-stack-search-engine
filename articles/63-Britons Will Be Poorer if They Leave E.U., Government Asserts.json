{"title": "Britons Will Be Poorer if They Leave E.U., Government Asserts", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/world/europe/european-union-brexit.html", "body": "In any event, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said at a speech in Bristol, England, that the country \u201cwould be permanently poorer if it left the European Union\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019d trade less, do less business and receive less investment.\u201d\n\nBackground on \u2018Brexit\u2019\n\nMr. Osborne, who with Prime Minister David Cameron is campaigning for Britons to vote to remain, added: \u201cThe price would be paid by British families. Wages would be lower, and prices would be higher.\u201d\n\nThose advocating an exit, including dissenters in the governing Conservative Party, quickly dismissed the analysis. Andrea Leadsom, a government minister who used to work in the Treasury, called it \u201cextraordinarily biased.\u201d\n\nThe release of the document highlights the quickening tempo of the referendum campaign, which officially began last week.\n\nAnd it precedes a visit to Britain this week by President Obama, who is expected, if asked, to endorse continued British membership in the bloc but to note that it is a decision for British voters.\n\nAdvocates of remaining in the bloc say they believe the economic warnings will prove decisive. The Treasury document outlines the impact on Britain under three main situations, depending on the terms of trade Britain would negotiate after leaving the European common market.\n\nIn the first of those, Britain would participate in the European Economic Area, like Norway, which is not a member of the European Union but which pays for access to Europe\u2019s single market and accepts the free movement of labor and capital. Under this situation, average annual output per household would be \u00a32,600 lower after 15 years, the report says.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder a bilateral trade agreement \u2014 like the ones the European Union has with Canada, Switzerland and Turkey \u2014 the reduction would be \u00a34,300, the Treasury found.\n\nIn the worst case, if Britain relied solely on the trading rules laid down by the World Trade Organization, as Russia or Brazil do, the amount would be \u00a35,200, according to the report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete fantasy to claim we could negotiate some other deal, where we have access to the E.U.\u2019s single market but don\u2019t have to accept the costs and obligations of E.U. membership,\u201d Mr. Osborne said in his speech. \u201cOther member states have made it very clear in recent weeks that\u2019s not on offer \u2014 and how could it be? How could other European countries give us a better deal than they have given themselves?\u201d\n\nMs. Leadsom told the BBC that the Treasury analysis ignored the benefits of increased trade with non-European nations, which, she argued, would be possible outside the European Union. She also added that it had failed to take into account the economic advantages of being free of burdensome regulations from Brussels.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

However, he added that, compared with other estimates, the Treasury document was \u201cbroadly in that range,\u201d arguing that \u201cit is not out of line with what many independent forecasters are suggesting.\u201d\n\nThe publication follows warnings that, were Britain to leave the bloc, its negotiations with continental partners may not be smooth.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday, the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, said if Britain voted to leave, the European Union would have to take a tough stance in the negotiations that followed, to set an example.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very clear that Brexit will have consequences; otherwise, that is the beginning of the dismantling,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cEverybody who disagrees on one or two points will decide to do the same.\u201d", "summary": "In any event, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said at a speech in Bristol, England, that the country \u201cwould be permanently poorer if it left the European Union\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019d trade less, do less business and receive less investment.\u201d Mr. Osborne, who with Prime Minister David Cameron is campaigning for Britons to vote to remain, added: \u201cThe price would be paid by British families.
