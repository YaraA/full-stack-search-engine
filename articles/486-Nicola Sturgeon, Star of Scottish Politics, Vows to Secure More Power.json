{"title": "Nicola Sturgeon, Star of Scottish Politics, Vows to Secure More Power", "authors": ["Katrin Bennhold", "Steven Erlanger"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/world/europe/nicola-sturgeon-star-of-scottish-politics-vows-to-secure-more-power.html", "body": "After independence was rejected in September, 55 percent to 45 percent, prompting her predecessor as party leader and Scotland\u2019s first minister, Alex Salmond, to resign, it seemed that the nationalist flame would wane. But under Ms. Sturgeon, a less divisive figure, party membership has more than quadrupled. \u201cNicola Sturgeon\u2019s party has more members than the British Army has soldiers,\u201d noted Alex Massie of the magazine The Spectator.\n\nIn last month\u2019s election, the S.N.P. won all but three of Scotland\u2019s 59 parliamentary seats, humiliating the Labour Party and becoming the third-largest party in Westminster.\n\nAlthough she did not run for a seat in the British Parliament, Ms. Sturgeon has gone from regional obscurity to one of the most powerful players in British politics. This week, she is in the United States, with an appearance on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d scheduled for Monday and a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday.\n\nHer distaste for the Conservatives is visceral and deep, and she campaigned fiercely on a theme of \u201clocking the Tories out of Downing Street.\u201d\n\nBut while she won her own landslide in Scotland, Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives won an unexpected majority in the country as a whole. Describing Mr. Cameron as \u201ca reasonably straight person to deal with\u201d and their relationship as \u201cbusinesslike,\u201d she said she will now press him for more autonomy.\n\nScotland\u2019s future status is as much dependent on Mr. Cameron as on anything Ms. Sturgeon does, she said \u2014 not only on what happens with the referendum on British membership in the European Union he has promised by the end of 2017, but also on whether the people of Scotland think he is willing to respond to their overwhelming vote for greater self-determination.\n\n\u201cThe ball is in his court,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople often put the onus on me \u2014 will Scotland have another referendum, will we be independent? I would say there\u2019s as much onus on David Cameron right now, because how he responds to the result of the general election in Scotland will in some way determine how people see Westminster and Scotland\u2019s place in Westminster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cameron made a symbolic effort last month, traveling to meet Ms. Sturgeon here, lingering obligingly in a prolonged handshake on the steps of Bute House, Scotland\u2019s Downing Street.\n\nBut Ms. Sturgeon wants more than Mr. Cameron, who has ruled out full fiscal autonomy, has so far offered. She is pressing for new powers to tax and spend, the right to set Scotland\u2019s own minimum wage, and autonomy in welfare policy to counter the tough budget cuts promised by Mr. Cameron.\n\nIn Brussels last week, she warned that if Britain votes to leave the European Union, Scotland might demand another shot at independence.\n\nMs. Sturgeon is a fan of the Danish television drama \u201cBorgen,\u201d in which the female leader of a small party unexpectedly becomes prime minister. She is a fan, too, of Scandinavian-style social democracy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Many immigrants supported independence\n\nThe S.N.P., which faces Scottish regional elections next year, has a more centrist record in government than its rhetoric suggests. While it favors a nuclear-free Scotland and wants to preserve free university education and medical prescriptions, its economic platform was broadly similar to Labour\u2019s.\n\nMs. Sturgeon and her party have benefited from the decline here of the British Labour Party, which had long been the main choice in Scotland for left-leaning voters.\n\n\u201cLabour became complacent,\u201d she said. Last year, the Labour leader at the time, Ed Miliband, stood \u201carm in arm, in partnership\u201d with Mr. Cameron to oppose Scottish independence, and \u201cfor many, many people in Scotland that was unforgivable,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen she joined in the 1980s, the S.N.P. had three seats in Parliament and Scotland\u2019s own legislature would not be established for another decade. She lost several elections before winning her first seat, refusing to take the traditional oath of allegiance to the queen (though by law she still had to make a \u201csolemn affirmation\u201d to \u201cbear allegiance\u201d to the monarch).\n\nShe learned \u201cthat an election win doesn\u2019t come easily, and just as it doesn\u2019t come easily it can be lost easily,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got to earn people\u2019s trust, and you\u2019ve got to earn it day after day after day.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of a dental nurse and an electrician in the working-class county of Ayrshire in southwest Scotland, Ms. Sturgeon was the first in her family to go to university, graduating in law from the University of Glasgow. Over three decades, she rose from grass-roots campaigner to leader, serving as party spokeswoman on everything from energy and education to housing, and, once her party was in government, as health secretary. She was Mr. Salmond\u2019s deputy for 10 years.\n\nEven some of her critics give her grudging respect. The journalist Piers Morgan called her \u201cthe most dangerous woman in Britain\u201d during the election campaign, but compared her to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a tough, uncompromising woman with a fierce, combative intelligence,\u201d he wrote recently. \u201cShe also shares Thatcher\u2019s withering disdain for the myriad less able men who dare to cross her political patch.\u201d\n\nMs. Sturgeon wants to inspire other women and provide them opportunities, something she said Mrs. Thatcher never did. \u201cShe left office not really having moved things forward for other women at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to try and make sure that me having the privilege of holding this job helps to open doors for other women as well.\u201d\n\nHer cabinet has as many women as men, and she is rooting for Hillary Rodham Clinton. \u201cTo have the first female president of the United States I think would be a very, very significant moment for women worldwide,\u201d she said.\n\nHaving undergone an image makeover, complete with a new hairstyle and a colorful, Scottish-designed wardrobe, Ms. Sturgeon spoke of her unease about the adjustment. \u201cI wish we lived in a world where how you looked or what you wore wasn\u2019t an issue for men or women, and it\u2019s by and large not an issue for men, so I wish it wasn\u2019t an issue for women but it is,\u201d she said, wearing a fitted apricot-colored dress and beige patent-leather heels. \u201cOf course you worry, \u2018Are you just playing into that?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe political and attitudinal differences between Scotland and England can be exaggerated, she said, \u201cbut Scotland undeniably is a nation, and in my view that means we should govern ourselves.\u201d She stopped, and added rather wistfully, \u201cOf course that was decided in the referendum, not the way I wanted it to be.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Cameron made a symbolic effort last month, traveling to meet Ms. Sturgeon here, lingering obligingly in a prolonged handshake on the steps of Bute House, Scotland\u2019s Downing Street.She is pressing for new powers to tax and spend, the right to set Scotland\u2019s own minimum wage, and autonomy in welfare policy to counter the tough budget cuts promised by Mr. Cameron.Ms. Sturgeon is a fan of the Danish television drama \u201cBorgen,\u201d in which the female leader of a small party unexpectedly becomes prime minister.In addition to Scots living in Scotland, all residents who were citizens of Britain and other European Union and British Commonwealth countries were allowed to vote in last year\u2019s referendum.While it favors a nuclear-free Scotland and wants to preserve free university education and medical prescriptions, its economic platform was broadly similar to Labour\u2019s."}
