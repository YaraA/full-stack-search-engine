Now he says it is the biggest challenge since World War II.\n\nAbout 800,000 asylum seekers are expected to have arrived in Germany by the end of the year, plunging the country into a live experiment that many believe could do more to transform it than even the fall of Communism.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming stance toward the thousands arriving from war and strife in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, ordinary cities like this one are suddenly coping with the extraordinary. From 100 migrants a month in June to 300 a week now, the effects here and in other states, cities and towns are accelerating. And it is at this level that the experiment will either work or not.\n\nTo work, there must be beds and showers. Translators and teachers. Social workers and police officers. Homes and classrooms. Jobs and money. And there must be cooperation from average Germans. Many of them have greeted the migrants with generosity, but others remain anxious and have yet to be convinced that the benefits are worth the cost, disruption and, ultimately, reconfiguration of German identity.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Erfurt and elsewhere, welcoming the migrants is not just a matter of managing logistics, it is also managing the public mood.\n\nSo far, this city on the edge of the former East, in the geographical heart of reunified Germany, is adapting. With a half-day\u2019s notice on Monday, a former conference center was transformed into a temporary camp for 674 people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBarely touched by the war, Erfurt has the feel of a fairy-tale town frozen in time, with a cobblestone center, pastel-colored medieval houses and church spires that are among the best preserved in Germany.\n\nSpare beds in 19 homes set aside for migrants were filled, and new ones were identified. The building used the night before for the new Syrian arrivals \u2014 a disused brothel \u2014 turned out to be particularly suitable: small rooms with separate showers and bathrooms. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d said Jens Hennig, one of the social workers running it. A coat of white paint transformed the pink walls.\n\nResidents have welcomed the trains of migrants with clapping and cheering. Housing facilities have turned away donations and volunteers because storage rooms are full.\n\nEven as some in the gymnasium and at other meetings like it expressed anxiety over crime, higher taxes and \u201cmore Muslims,\u201d others stood up to express sympathy with the migrants.\n\nErfurt has absorbed successive waves of mass migration, said Steffen Rassloff, a respected local historian. Migration \u2014 from Celts and Slavs and Dutch bridge builders to a thriving Jewish community in the Middle Ages that helped make the city a wealthy metropolis \u2014 has been mostly beneficial, he said.\n\nBut there was tension even when roughly 14 million Germans were expelled from the eastern territories that became part of the Soviet bloc after World War II, and 670,000 of them came through emergency camps in Erfurt. \u201cAnd that was with the same language and the same culture,\u201d Mr. Rassloff said.\n\nToday, unease is palpable in a city that is no stranger to ideological extremes. The Left Party, successor of the eastern Communist party, runs the state administration in a coalition with Social Democrats and Greens. The far-right National Party of Germany has a representative in the City Council. There was an arson attack this week on three (still uninhabited) homes for migrants in the northern part of Thuringia, the state in which Erfurt is the capital.\n\nBack in the neo-Gothic City Hall, a monument to 19th-century Prussian pride, Alexander Hilge admitted that he was worried. He had just come out of a briefing with state officials. Tens of thousands more migrants were reportedly on their way to Germany from Hungary. Of every new group, Germany\u2019s federal quota system will send 2.5 percent to Thuringia. And one in 10 of those will end up in Erfurt.\n\nMr. Hilge, 38, coordinates the city\u2019s response to the migrant crisis. His office has become the unofficial situation room. Since Monday, a crisis team of the city\u2019s firefighters, social workers, school officials, health authorities and finance committee members has met every day at 9 a.m. On the agenda one morning this week: an imminent shortage of shelter if migrants keep coming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWerner Ungewiss of the education authority outlined a tentative plan to take over 13 of the city\u2019s 68 school gymnasiums. \u201cPhysical education will be canceled, and sport clubs using the facilities no longer have access,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hilge shifted in his seat. \u201cParents will revolt.\u201d He spoke of \u201cVolkszorn,\u201d or people\u2019s wrath. So far, managing the public mood has been about asking locals to accept migrants as neighbors. \u201cNow we\u2019re reaching deep into their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are taking their children\u2019s classes away, their football clubs.\u201d\n\nThere is little choice.\n\nWaiting outside his office was Jens B\u00f6sel, manager of EBB, a company that sells live-in containers. There is now a delivery backlog of up to 25 weeks.\n\nCots are also running low across Germany. Mr. Hilge is looking into ordering 5,000 beds and mattresses from Ikea Poland. He spent an hour on the phone trying to buy portable showers. \u201cSold out,\u201d he said.\n\nVideo\n\nThere are a lot of rules in Germany. Rules governing who is allowed to teach migrants German, how to tender building contracts, the number of emergency exits in a temporary camp, the hours a bus driver is allowed to drive.\n\n\u201cSometimes we are too German for our own good,\u201d Mr. Hilge sighed.\n\nThe migrant crisis is not just a humanitarian imperative, it is an opportunity. Germany has among the lowest birthrates in Europe. The population is shrinking and aging, particularly in the former East.\n\n\u201cI just met a refugee family with five children,\u201d Dieter Lauinger, the state minister for migration, said. \u201cFive children. These people could be paying our retirement.\u201d Businesses in the region are looking for 3,000 apprentices. Electricians and builders are in demand. Doctors and teachers, too.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGiving people a roof over their heads and three meals a day is a gigantic task, Mr. Lauinger said. \u201cBut it\u2019s small compared to giving them a future.\u201d\n\nThe Johannes primary school in central Erfurt knows this firsthand. There are two asylum homes in its district. These days the headmistress, Sabine Iffarth, gets phone calls from panicked counterparts across the city seeking advice from her experience with migrant children.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI tell them that they need a whole new infrastructure for this,\u201d she said. Her school now has an \u201cintegration helper,\u201d a social worker, a psychologist and an educator who speaks Arabic. A number of its teachers are getting extra qualifications to teach German as a second language. It also had to buy a second barbecue grill: Muslim children are served chicken and turkey sausage, not the local pork sausage.\n\nSince last year, the school has run an intensive language course for newcomers. For four hours every morning, children learn German, then are integrated into regular classes for the rest of the day. The most recent additions are two Syrian sisters, Sabah, 7, and Arzo, 8, who three weeks into the term can already name vegetables and fruit and answer basic questions in German.\n\nNot all are happy with the attention and resources dedicated to non-Germans, inside and outside the school, Ms. Iffarth said. Those granted asylum in Germany get an apartment, health insurance, a language course and 399 euros (about $450) a month. Many in the neighborhood are unemployed and have problems of their own. \u201cWe fail to integrate the losers in our society, and then we ask them to integrate the refugees,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Hennig, the social worker at the brothel-turned-asylum home, had to unfriend some of his relatives on Facebook because they were calling the migrants parasites. It makes him angry. All the migrants he has met want to learn German and work as soon as possible, he said.\n\nOne of them, Shyar Ibrahym, 34, a car mechanic and Kurdish refugee from Aleppo, Syria, wore a German soccer shirt on his second night in Erfurt. In his first-floor room, which he shares with three others, a German flag adorns the wall. His friend Othman Othman was registered as \u201cAssmann Assmann\u201d by immigration officials. No matter.\n\n\u201cI love Germany,\u201d Mr. Ibrahym said. \u201cI will be a good citizen.\u201d", "summary": "In the aftermath of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming stance toward the thousands arriving from war and strife in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, ordinary cities like this one are suddenly coping with the extraordinary.
