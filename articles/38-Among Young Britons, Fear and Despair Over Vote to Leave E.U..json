{"title": "Among Young Britons, Fear and Despair Over Vote to Leave E.U.", "authors": ["Claire Barthelemy", "Kimiko De Freytas-Tamura"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/world/europe/among-young-britons-fear-and-despair-over-vote-to-leave-eu.html", "body": "For those under 25, the desire to remain in the union was especially high: Three-quarters wanted Britain to stay in Europe.\n\nMany young people in Britain have grown up thinking of European integration as a given, not a political experiment that would be rolled back before they could fully take part in it.\n\nThey are often more comfortable living in a multicultural society than their elders are, particularly in cities like London and Edinburgh, which are flooded by people from across the Continent to study and work.\n\nMany young Britons expressed astonishment, anger or despair that their parents and grandparents would seek to limit the travel, exposure to other cultures and opportunities to work and study abroad that being part of the European Union has afforded them.\n\n\u201cTruly gutted that our grandparents have effectively decided that they hate foreigners more than they love us and our futures,\u201d one young Briton, Dan Boden, wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe referendum hinged in part on youth turnout, and the government even tried to lower the voting age for the referendum to 16 from 18.\n\nIt failed, but the Remain campaign still pushed to register young voters, with some success: The deadline to register was extended by two days after a voter-registration website crashed because it was overwhelmed by visitors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron turned to Tinder, the dating app, and TheLADbible, a website popular among young men, to tout the benefits of staying in the European Union. The opposition Labour Party, which supported remaining in the bloc, also reached out to young voters.\n\nMore than one million people between 18 and 34 registered in recent months, the most ever for a British election, according to Bite the Ballot and HOPE Not Hate, which encourage young people to vote. Turnout for the referendum, at around 72 percent, was the highest for any national election in Britain since 1992.\n\nBut it was not enough.\n\n\u201cWaking up to the #EURefResults and realizing the older generation have just ruined our future,\u201d one young Briton, Toby Pickard, wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnother, Sarah Hartley, wrote that \u201cour economy is in tatters\u201d because \u201cour grandparents cared more about their comfort than our future.\u201d\n\nIn Edinburgh, a university city with a strongly pro-European bent, Robert Jack, a 21-year-old student at the University of Glasgow, was reeling from the decision. He worried that his plans to study in Romania on the European Union\u2019s student-exchange program, Erasmus, were in jeopardy.\n\nThe vote \u201cis very damaging,\u201d Mr. Jack said, adding that he now welcomed a second referendum on whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom, because \u201cit\u2019s better being inside the European Union.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, many young people supported the push to rid themselves of Europe. Ben Kew, 21, said he spent 30 hours at the Leave headquarters, watching the results come in.\n\n\u201cI was surprised; I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d go through with it, but I\u2019m pleased that the establishment has been given a kick,\u201d he said, adding that the vote was a moment when Britons expressed a desire for real change.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut many young voters wondered what would happen to European Union funding for research and sciences. British universities currently receive about 16 percent of their research money and staff members from the European Union.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But many young people said they thought the decision would only set back their prospects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already part of a generation stuck in rented property unable to buy my own house,\u201d Hannah Shaw, 25, who works at a National Health Service hospital and lives with her parents, wrote in an email. \u201cThe older generation seem so happy with the result, almost smug like it\u2019s some sort of victory completely unaware of the chaos they\u2019ve caused for my generation. I\u2019m dreading what will happen to employment, workers\u2019 rights, the environment and our economy.\u201d\n\nShe added that she had friends from countries like Slovakia, Poland, Spain and Romania.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see it affect them and think of the amazing people I\u2019ll never meet after we leave the E.U.,\u201d she said. \u201cThe U.K. suddenly feels very small.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Shaw blamed the news media for spreading misinformation about European Union membership. \u201cA lot of the older generation rely on newspapers for all their facts and don\u2019t actually do any of their own research unlike my generation.\u201d\n\nJenna Ives-Moody, 19, a journalism student at the University of Huddersfield in northern England, wrote in an email that \u201cserious fact-based journalism within the U.K. is not valued by the majority of the English population.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe said the Leave campaign was driven by \u201ca misplaced ideal of reclaiming former glories within Britain,\u201d which she said was not common among young people \u201cwho embrace all aspects of being European.\u201d\n\nFear was palpable among the young people in London who have thronged the capital from elsewhere in Europe.\n\nFrancisco Vicedo, a 22-year-old Spaniard who works at a branch of the fast-food chain Pret a Manger, is studying for a master\u2019s program on organized crime and terrorism at University College London.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already sent money to our countries because we know that in the following days the value of the pound is going to be down,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is sending money already.\u201d\n\nHe said he hoped to stay in London, where job opportunities are more plentiful than in Spain, but was unsure of his prospects.\n\nDara Canavan, 23, who works at a management consultancy, comes from an Irish town just across the border from Northern Ireland, and expressed fear about the possible reimposition of border controls.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of worry about whether free control between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be affected,\u201d said Mr. Canavan.\n\nMr. Canavan wasn\u2019t sure he would stay in Britain. \u201cI was thinking of going back in the future, but this could speed up the process,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Many young Britons expressed astonishment, anger or despair that their parents and grandparents would seek to limit the travel, exposure to other cultures and opportunities to work and study abroad that being part of the European Union has afforded them.
