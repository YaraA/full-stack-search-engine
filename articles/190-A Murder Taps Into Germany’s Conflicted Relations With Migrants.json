It expects to take in some 500 more refugees by August, on top of the 3,000 or so who live here already.\n\nBut comments on the website of the local newspaper, which has a special section devoted to experience with the refugees, have hinted at suspicions and resentments bubbling below the surface of Celle\u2019s seeming embrace of the newcomers.\n\n\u201cYou read a lot about the refugees when it\u2019s positive,\u201d Sebastian Nitz, a 29-year-old roofer, said. \u201cLike a refugee found money and returned it. But heaven forbid someone does something bad. If you report at all, then it should be everything.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cNo one is really enthusiastic about the refugees,\u201d added Mr. Nitz, who was reached by telephone after complaining on the newspaper\u2019s website that it had failed to mention that the murder suspect was a refugee and suggested it was \u201cmuzzled.\u201d\n\nInitially, the police in Celle and state prosecutors kept the fact that the suspect was a refugee under wraps.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe police spokesman, Thorsten Wallheinke, suggested the step was justified under federal guidelines that allow the authorities to withhold the ethnic or other identifying details of a suspect if they are deemed irrelevant to a case.\n\nFor his part, the mayor insisted that the refugee background was not necessarily material to the killing, and that \u201cpeople here in Celle have dealt with this.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he said, he had disagreed with keeping the background of the suspect secret, and asked state prosecutors to make it public, which they eventually did within a day. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he said, \u201cI was afraid it would become a big theme.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThat is what happened after hundreds of New Year\u2019s Eve sexual assaults in Cologne and other cities, when the police initially failed to describe the attackers as mostly migrant men of North African or Arab origin.\n\nBut in Celle, whether the background of the unidentified suspect, and the victim, is entirely irrelevant is not wholly clear.\n\nMr. Hushmand arrived in Germany in 1979, another time of Mideast turmoil, when he was 19 and had fled his native Tehran as the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini built the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nAs time passed, Mr. Hushmand acquired all the basic accouterments of a German life: a college degree, citizenship and the coveted status of Beamte, or civil servant, as a teacher of math and science.\n\nAs more than a million migrants and refugees descended on Germany last year, Mr. Hushmand proved particularly useful as a translator, said Werner Gl\u00e4ser, a close friend and retired teacher.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nMr. Hushmand\u2019s native Farsi is very close to Dari, one main language in Afghanistan, which after Syria and Iraq was a main source of migrants arriving in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong those migrants, the authorities say, was a 58-year-old Afghan who landed at Celle\u2019s refugee facility last fall with his wife and six children and moved into an apartment in January.\n\nMr. Hushmand took the family under his wing, said Mr. Gl\u00e4ser, relating that the wife was very sick, and that, in keeping with his habit, Mr. Hushmand had visited her in the hospital. He also bought shoes for the children, Mr. Gl\u00e4ser said.\n\n\u201cMehdi had been a refugee himself,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knew how hard it is to be a stranger in a totally strange land.\u201d\n\nIn late March, however, the police disclosed that the Afghan had confessed to the murder and told them that he had acted because Mr. Hushmand \u2014 divorced and childless at 55 \u2014 insisted on marrying the refugee\u2019s 19-year-old daughter.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Residents had even pledged to continue caring for the Afghan family.\n\nFriends collected some 4,000 euros to fly Mr. Hushmand\u2019s body to Tehran, fulfilling his known wish to be buried there. They have agreed to give the little money left over to care for refugees under 18, Mr. Gl\u00e4ser said.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cwould be in Mehdi\u2019s spirit.\u201d"}
