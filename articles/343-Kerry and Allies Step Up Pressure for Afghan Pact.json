Mr. Daudzai, who previously served as Mr. Karzai\u2019s chief of staff and then as Afghanistan\u2019s ambassador in Pakistan and Iran, is close to the Afghan president.\n\nThe Obama administration has urged that Mr. Karzai sign the bilateral security accord before the end of the year, and not wait until after the election.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Allen, the former senior American commander in Afghanistan and a retired Marine Corps general, has written that it is a mistake for the White House to insist that the issue be decided before the end of the year and has urged a more flexible policy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, he asserted that the White House should continue to prepare for a post-2014 mission of carrying out counterterrorism missions and training and supporting Afghan forces and wait to see to if the next Afghan president will endorse the accord.\n\n\u201cIt would be a mistake to let one man, increasingly detached from Afghan public and political opinion, determine the fate of the American role in South Asia,\u201d General Allen said in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times last week that he wrote with Michael E. O\u2019Hanlon of the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cThe United States should stay patient,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt can say to Mr. Karzai, if you want to reinforce Afghan democracy by letting your successor sign this security deal, we can live with that.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Kerry made it clear that the Obama administration has a much tighter timetable in mind and believes that the United States and its allies need all the time they can get to prepare the handover to Afghan forces.\n\n\u201cThis is not fooling around,\u201d Mr. Kerry said at a news conference at NATO headquarters.\n\n\u201cHow do you give confidence to the people of Afghanistan?\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you give confidence to all those people running for office next year who are looking for some certainty as to what the basis and foundation of that election might be about?\n\n\u201cCan you muddle through? Can you do other things? That is not the issue,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cThe issue is how do you get the best transition possible.\u201d"}
