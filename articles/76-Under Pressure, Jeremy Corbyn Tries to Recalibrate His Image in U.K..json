The truth is, everybody would examine that situation, including Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. These two are not egomaniacs; they are not desperate to cling on to power for power\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McCluskey later said Mr. Corbyn had his \u201cfull support,\u201d but the damage was done.\n\nMr. Corbyn has been a divisive leader, and he faced down a fierce but badly organized internal challenge in the autumn. That was less than a year after he won the leadership in a surprise vote, after Labour did so badly in the May 2015 elections that his predecessor, the more moderate leftist Ed Miliband, resigned.\n\nSuperficially, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s position has stabilized since last year, when an open feud with more centrist lawmakers culminated in the unsuccessful challenge to his leadership.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Internal critics are biding their time, with many devoting their political energies to working on important parliamentary committees.\n\nThey hope that, with Labour\u2019s poll ratings poor, the tide will eventually turn against their leader, and that Mr. McCluskey might lose his re-election bid to lead Unite.\n\nThere is little sign of a revival of Labour support among voters, however, despite Mr. Corbyn\u2019s success in attracting a cohort of enthusiastic, often younger, party members. There has been no apparent recovery in Scotland, once a Labour Party heartland, where the party slipped into third place in last year\u2019s elections to the Scottish Parliament.\n\nAlso, UKIP is targeting the sort of working-class voters in the north of England who traditionally voted Labour. That threat was made explicit with the recent election of the new leader of UKIP, Paul Nuttall, who was raised in Bootle, in northwest England, and whose pitch for the job was his appeal to disenchanted Labour supporters.\n\nDespite the effort for a \u201cCorbyn 2.0,\u201d and widespread concern among British civil servants and business leaders that Prime Minister Theresa May is unclear about how to manage an exit from the European Union \u2014 a charge Mr. Corbyn also makes \u2014 he, too, seems confused on the issue.\n\nWhile trying to react to concerns in the party that Labour needs to respond to voter anxiety about immigration, Mr. Corbyn still wants Britain to remain in the European single market.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Corbyn, backing \u201cfair rules and reasonably managed migration,\u201d also suggested that the only limit on immigration controls was the need to balance them against trading with the single market.\n\nBut membership in the single market usually means accepting freedom of movement of labor and capital, and the rulings of the European Court of Justice, as European leaders constantly emphasize. That is widely assumed to make limits on immigration and access to the single market incompatible.\n\nMr. Nuttall told the BBC on Tuesday that Mr. Corbyn \u201cseems all over the place\u201d and was \u201csaying that Labour isn\u2019t wedded to free movement \u2014 but then says we will bargain that to have access to the single market.\u201d\n\nMr. Corbyn\u2019s speech was intended to emphasize his shift on migration, but his comments on a wage cap dominated coverage on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cGiven that Mr. Corbyn could not put a rough number on where the cap should be \u2014 other than confirming it would not affect his own salary \u2014 suggests he has not properly thought this proposal through,\u201d Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a London-based free-market research institute, said in a statement.", "summary": "Inequality in income is getting worse in Britain, he said, something that cannot continue \u201cif we want to live in a more egalitarian society.\u201d He added, \u201cI would like there to be some kind of high earnings cap, quite honestly.\u201d They hope that, with Labour\u2019s poll ratings poor, the tide will eventually turn against their leader, and that Mr. McCluskey might lose his re-election bid to lead Unite.
