Across Europe, far-right populist parties are gaining strength, including in France, while the mainstream left, which played a central role in building modern Europe, is in crisis. From Italy to Poland to Britain and beyond, voters are deserting center-left parties, as leftist politicians struggle to remain relevant in a moment when politics is inflamed by anti-immigrant, anti-European Union anger.\n\n\u201cWherever you look in Europe the Socialists are not doing well, with the exception of Portugal,\u201d said Philippe Marli\u00e8re, a professor of French and European politics at University College London. He added that the left lacked \u201ca narrative that tries to unite the different sectors of the working class.\u201d\n\nEach country has its distinctive dynamics, but one common theme is the difficulty many mainstream left parties are having in responding to the economic and social dislocation caused by globalization. In Italy, constituencies that used to routinely back the center-left Democratic Party are turning to the new anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which is Euroskeptic and anti-globalization \u2014 just as some working-class, left-wing voters in France are now looking at the extreme-right National Front.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe have a population cut in half by globalization,\u201d said Thomas Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, a political science professor at Sciences Po in Paris and the author of \u201cUnhappy Globalization,\u201d who sees the winners and losers of globalization as the axis of European politics.\n\nA breakdown of voting patterns in the December referendum in Italy, which resulted in the fall of the center-left government, revealed that urban centers, the southern half of the country and young, unemployed workers overwhelmingly rejected the reform measures put forward by Matteo Renzi, then the prime minister.\n\n\u201cThose very voters who were traditionally represented by the left in this case, veered to the Five Star Movement,\u201d said Marco Damilano, a political commentator for the newsmagazine L\u2019Espresso. He added that the new party had built on popular anger even though it did not offer answers for the malaise.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe coalition of Poland\u2019s two biggest left-wing parties, the Democratic Left Alliance and Your Movement, suffered a humiliating defeat in 2015. Not only did the conservatives win an absolute majority in Parliament for the first time since the collapse of communism, but the left garnered so little support that not a single left-wing politician represents those interests in Parliament.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Britain, the Labour Party is in tatters with a leader who appeals to activists but has failed to build a broad-based coalition.\n\nAcross Europe, the old Socialist blocs have fractured into smaller parties, partly because their voting bases have changed but also because rampant inequality and the decline of the middle class have created fertile ground for more extreme parties.\n\n\u201cOn the left they are trying to stand up for their old core group, industrial workers,\u201d said Steve Coulter, who teaches political economy at the London School of Economics. \u201cBut then there\u2019s another group on the left, who are pro-free trade, L.G.B.T., flat-white drinking, bearded hipsters \u2014 and that\u2019s the middle-class part of their support.\u201d\n\nThe result in France is that the National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, \u201chas moved into the old traditionalist, protectionist precincts of the authoritarian left,\u201d Mr. Coulter said.\n\nIn Limousin, a relatively poor area of central France best known for the succulent beef from its cattle industry, its yellow apples and its elegant Limoges porcelain, these broader economic forces are evident. Mr. Ducourtioux said that he had voted for Mr. Hollande in the last election, but that this time he was looking toward the National Front, although he stopped short of naming it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And for most of the last 100 years it was a left-leaning stronghold.\n\nThe Socialist mayor of Limoges, Alain Rodet, served multiple terms until he was toppled in 2014 by a well-known psychiatrist, \u00c9mile-Roger Lombertie. He had no government experience and ran as an outsider (although on the eve of the election he became a member of the mainstream conservative party, now known as the Republicans).\n\nIn those same local elections, National Front candidates won an unprecedented 17 percent of the votes in the first round, a high figure given the leftist traditions of the area, which was the birthplace in 1895 of France\u2019s leading trade union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a small storefront office, Vincent G\u00e9rard, a representative of the National Front in the region, said the party\u2019s growth was telling because the left was so entrenched there. His own story is typical of many people in the region. His small electrical supply business once had five employees but now has two, including himself. \u201cEighty percent of my clients were industrial, and in five years I lost all of them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe markets are no longer local,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have gone to Romania, or the Czech Republic, I don\u2019t know exactly. They\u2019re in Europe, but in Eastern Europe.\u201d\n\nCompounding the sense of a changing world, even a modest wave of immigration disturbed many local residents. Beginning about six years ago, a small number of sub-Saharan Africans arrived in Limoges, soon followed by bigger numbers of Eastern Europeans.\n\n\u201cSo, here in our street, we had principally Bulgarians, afterwards Romanians and then Albanians,\u201d Mr. G\u00e9rard said. \u201cWhy? This I know, because Europe no longer has any borders.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, many affluent people began moving to the suburbs for bigger houses and left the city center to older people and newcomers, many of whom were migrants.\n\nMr. Rodet, the mayor who was toppled, said that just weeks before the election, there had been a rumor that an abandoned military base near the center of Limoges would become a home for \u201c3,000 Kosovars.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not true, but I did not respond quickly enough,\u201d he said, and by then the idea had gained currency.\n\nNot all traditional centrist voters are concerned about immigration or dwindling manufacturing jobs. Alexis Mons, a high-tech entrepreneur, has a digital marketing firm, Emakina, which does branding worldwide for companies, many of them high end.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis worry is the politicians and citizens who want to turn back the clock and stop the pace of change, so he is looking closely at the policies of Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister under Mr. Hollande. Mr. Macron is running for president as an independent, favors international trade and is rising in the polls.\n\n\u201cYou have an old industrial base that is very much intertwined with the political milieu in some fashion,\u201d Mr. Mons said. \u201cAll this little world talks to each other, it has its customs, it does business and then a new economy is born, a new economy with start-ups, with people coming from the internet, and that no one foresaw.\u201d\n\nThere are now more than 100 high-tech firms just in Limoges, Mr. Mons said, yet few people in the area know about the business park where the companies are.\n\n\u201cI have the impression that a good part of the establishment lives wearing the spectacles of the 20th century,\u201d he said. He added that politicians were manipulating the picture so that \u201cin the working-class neighborhoods, there has been a sense of abandonment that pushes people into the arms of the National Front.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d he said, \u201cand a certain number of people do not want to see that.\u201d", "summary": "A breakdown of voting patterns in the December referendum in Italy, which resulted in the fall of the center-left government, revealed that urban centers, the southern half of the country and young, unemployed workers overwhelmingly rejected the reform measures put forward by Matteo Renzi, then the prime minister.
