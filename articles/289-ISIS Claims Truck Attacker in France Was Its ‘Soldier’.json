But after a gunman, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., last month, having pledged loyalty to the group, it called him a \u201cfighter.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nIn a statement on Saturday on its radio station, the Islamic State referred to Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel as \u201ca soldier\u201d who had responded to the group\u2019s call \u201cto target states participating in the crusader coalition that fights the caliphate.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the Islamic State\u2019s spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, called on the group\u2019s followers to attack Westerners in retaliation for strikes by the United States-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He has repeatedly singled out France, which is part of the coalition, as a main enemy.\n\nNo evidence has emerged that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel got training or orders from the Islamic State, unlike the perpetrators of attacks in and around Paris on Nov. 13 and Brussels on March 22. The Islamic State has blurred the line between operations planned and carried out by its core fighters and those carried out by sympathizers inspired, only at a distance, to commit violence.\n\nBut on Saturday, France\u2019s defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said: \u201cI remind you that Daesh\u2019s ideologue, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, has for several weeks repeated calls to attack directly, even individually, Frenchmen, in particular, or Americans, wherever they are, by any means necessary.\u201d Daesh is an Arabic name for the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cIt is murder, and Daesh\u2019s claim of responsibility comes later, as has happened in other recent events,\u201d Mr. Le Drian added. \u201cEven if Daesh doesn\u2019t do the organizing, Daesh inspires this terrorist spirit, against which we are fighting.\u201d\n\nMr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, 31, a native of Tunisia, had a history of petty crime going back to 2010. He received a six-month suspended sentence this year for assaulting a motorist, but was not on the radar of French intelligence agencies. Indeed, he seemed more like a surly misfit \u2014 he beat his wife, until she threw him out \u2014 than a prospective terrorist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe country\u2019s top law enforcement official, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, said Saturday: \u201cThe individual who committed this absolutely despicable, unspeakable crime was not known by the intelligence services, as he had not stood out over the past years \u2014 whether through court convictions or through his activity \u2014 for support of radical Islamist ideology.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Cazeneuve added: \u201cIt seems that he radicalized himself very quickly. In any case, these are the first elements that have come to light through the testimony of his acquaintances.\u201d\n\nIn Msaken, Tunisia, the attacker\u2019s father, Mohamed Mondher Lahouaiej Bouhlel, told Agence France-Presse on Friday night that his son had depression, and that he \u201chad almost no links to religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t pray,\u201d the father continued. \u201cHe didn\u2019t fast. He drank alcohol, and even used drugs.\u201d\n\nHe said of his son, \u201cFrom 2002 to 2004, he had problems that caused a nervous breakdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would become angry, and he shouted,\u201d he said. \u201cHe would break anything he saw in front of him.\u201d\n\nThe son was prescribed medication for emotional problems, the elder Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel said, adding that his son was \u201calways alone, always depressed\u201d and often silent.\n\nThe father said he and his family had almost no contact with his son since he left for France. The son appears to have arrived in Nice around 2005 and to have returned to Tunisia for a sister\u2019s wedding in 2012.\n\nThe Huffington Post quoted Rabab Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a sister of the attacker, as saying her brother \u201cdid not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, but he also did not pray and never entered a mosque in his life.\u201d She added: \u201cHe was just not stable psychologically and mentally. His wife and her mother both complained about his violent behavior toward her.\u201d\n\nFour people acquainted with Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel are in police custody, along with his estranged wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince Thursday evening, several French officials \u2014 particularly from right-leaning parties opposed to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist government \u2014 have criticized the government\u2019s handling of intelligence gathering and law enforcement, especially after attacks in January and November killed a total of 147 people.\n\nChristian Estrosi, the president of the region encompassing Nice, wrote in an open letter on Saturday that he had asked for additional security for Bastille Day, but was rebuffed because there was no specific threat.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The tournament was targeted by several plots that the authorities thwarted, according to Mr. Cazeneuve.\n\nThe police prefecture for the Alpes-Maritimes department, where Nice is, said security measures on the night of the attack included random searches, the addition of plainclothes officers and the blocking of access points.\n\nThe truck \u201cforced its way through, by driving onto the sidewalk,\u201d bypassing a checkpoint where police vehicles blocked the entrance to the promenade, the prefecture said. It added that 64 national and 42 municipal police officers had worked together to secure the area, along with 20 soldiers.\n\n\u201cHow did this horrible act occur on this evening?\u201d Mr. Le Foll said. \u201cBecause a man decided to rent a truck four days before, all alone, and that he decided to kill people on the 14th of July.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cazeneuve said the French state, or national government, had worked with the City of Nice to protect the Bastille Day celebrations, as well as events like the Cannes film festival, which takes place about 25 miles west of Nice, and the annual Nice carnival.\n\n\u201cIf one of the authorities \u2014 the state or the city \u2014 had at one point considered that the level of security was not adequate, the state or the city could have decided to ban the July 14 festivities, which neither did,\u201d Mr. Cazeneuve said.\n\nPeople returned to the beach on Saturday, in far smaller numbers than in the days before the attack, but signs of a shaken city were still in evidence. Local officials observed a moment of silence at a makeshift memorial on the Promenade des Anglais, the site of the carnage.\n\nThe promenade reopened to vehicular traffic on Saturday afternoon. It had been closed to traffic for the Bastille Day fireworks celebration and remained closed after the attack as it was turned, in effect, into a 1.5-mile crime scene.\n\nMany streets were still blocked, parents were still searching for missing children, and hospital staff members who have been dealing with scores of victims continued to treat dozens of patients, including many children, who had life-threatening injuries.", "summary": "After a husband and wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December, the Amaq News Agency described them as \u201ctwo supporters,\u201d making it clear that the Islamic State had not directed their actions.
