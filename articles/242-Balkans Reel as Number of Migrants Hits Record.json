The problem is, we are getting 10,000 a day and hearing reports that it will soon grow to 13,000. This is something Slovenia cannot cope with anymore.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, European Union officials approved a 17-point plan that may not see fruition for months. It includes more accommodations in Greece, the European Union country the migrants usually enter first, as well as along the entire migrant trail through the Balkans, plus fresh reserves of border guards and injections of cash to help financially struggling Balkan nations pay for all of this.\n\nVideo\n\nSlovenia\u2019s foreign minister, Karl Erjavec, said his country would welcome the support of other European countries, including 400 new police officers. But he warned that Slovenia could not accommodate the growing number of people in need for long without outside support. If help does not come soon, he said, the country will take unilateral measures, including potentially building its own fence along the Croatian border and deploying additional troops to guard the frontier.\n\n\u201cAll plans remain on the table if promises from the Brussels summit are not fulfilled,\u201d Mr. Erjavec said.\n\nRefugee officials worry that it is too little too late, and that the new plan will suffer the same fate as all of the previous, ineffectual European Union efforts to manage and cope with the largest movement of people across Europe since World War II.\n\n\u201cThis should have been done months ago,\u201d said Babar Baloch, spokesman in Hungary for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Pirc Musar, the Slovenian Red Cross president, said, \u201cWe are trying to use a small fire extinguisher to kill a giant fire.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, migrants \u2014 exhausted, cold and frequently forced to stop \u2014 are growing impatient, crossing one border after another.\n\nGroups of young men from Afghanistan and other countries, noticeably more aggressive toward the police than the terrified families traveling with them, are becoming a challenge for the authorities and other refugees.\n\n\u201cThey were pushing so hard, those men, but my husband got the beatings from the police,\u201d said Yasmin Ayoud, a 27-year-old Syrian, who gently pulled back a bandage from her husband\u2019s head to expose the wound while her sister-in-law, Joumana, silently watched.\n\nMs. Ayoud and her husband, Houssam, 32, had been at the police barricade in the town of Brezice, near the Croatian border, when groups of young men began chanting \u201cLet us go!\u201d and pushed forward.\n\n\u201cI got panicked and leaned forward and grabbed Yasmin with one hand and Joumana with the other, screaming \u2018Hold onto me!\u2019 when the blow came from above,\u201d Mr. Ayoud said. \u201cThe policeman must have thought I was shouting at him. I was not. I was just afraid.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that within two days of the Hungarian border closing, the numbers entering Slovenia were already larger than what the authorities could manage to register, house, feed and transport onward.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hundreds of blankets, heaters and containers of clothes were destroyed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThese people just want to move on, and when they are made to stop, they get nervous and extremely unhappy and then such incidents happen,\u201d said Bostjan Sefic, a senior official in the Slovenian Interior Ministry.\n\nPolice officers and military troops scour the countryside searching for groups of people who had slipped around the border crossing, trying to redirect them to official reception centers \u2014 all of which were at capacity.\n\nOne night last week, a group of migrants missed a bridge crossing and tried to wade across a frigid river when a Slovenian police helicopter saw them and used its spotlight to guide them.\n\nPeople waiting at the border to be taken to reception centers by bus, if they were lucky, or by foot, if they were not, were hungry and thirsty and agitated this week. Relief workers complained about the lack of communication between the police and relief workers, and between the Croatian government and the Slovenians, which made the situation almost impossible to manage.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can plan such a huge wave of people if you do not receive information in time,\u201d said Mrs. Pirc Musar. \u201cA few days ago, we were preparing for 1,000 people, and all of a sudden somebody calls and says that Croatia just ejected 2,500 people from trains and were sending them walking across the border.\u201d\n\nAt the frontier of Austria, aid workers worried what might happen if the country closed its border or, worse yet, if Germany \u2014 the desired goal of many of the migrants \u2014 announced that it could take no more people.\n\n\u201cWe are simply overwhelmed and overcrowded,\u201d said Leo Josefus, a police spokesman at the Austrian border town of Spielfeld, a short walk from Sentilj. \u201cThere is no space for all of them, not now and not tomorrow, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nTrain service between the border and the nearest major Austrian city, Graz, has been suspended for fears migrants on the tracks will be struck.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne night at the Spielfeld crossing, families forced to sleep in the open air struggled to keep their distance from rabble-rousing young men. Even many Syrian men were wary of mixing with migrants from other countries.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want trouble with the police or anybody else,\u201d said Sohaib Kahtani, 21, who fled the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor.\n\nYoung men from Afghanistan and elsewhere were frequently provoking fights, Mr. Kahtani said. A group of three Afghans offered Mr. Kahtani and a traveling companion $300 for their Syrian passports and grew abusive when they refused.\n\n\u201cThey were very aggressive and we ran away from them,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Mr. Kahtani said he sympathized with the plight of the young Afghans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to offend them,\u201d he said. \u201cI know they had hard lives far away from this world. But we Syrians, we had schools and we had cities and restaurants and music and joy with friends before this war destroyed all of our lives.\u201d", "summary": "The remaining 12,000 or so are at government registration centers, stuck on trains or buses, or simply in the open, roughing it in the increasingly cold fields and forests of the ragged foothills.Refugee officials worry that it is too little too late, and that the new plan will suffer the same fate as all of the previous, ineffectual European Union efforts to manage and cope with the largest movement of people across Europe since World War II.Ms. Ayoud and her husband, Houssam, 32, had been at the police barricade in the town of Brezice, near the Croatian border, when groups of young men began chanting \u201cLet us go!\u201d and pushed forward.The problem is that within two days of the Hungarian border closing, the numbers entering Slovenia were already larger than what the authorities could manage to register, house, feed and transport onward.Police officers and military troops scour the countryside searching for groups of people who had slipped around the border crossing, trying to redirect them to official reception centers \u2014 all of which were at capacity."}
