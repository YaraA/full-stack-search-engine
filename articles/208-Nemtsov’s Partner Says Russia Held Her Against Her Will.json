The two had dinner and then started the walk home.\n\nAt no point, she said, did she notice anything suspicious, and she suggested that she had little to help investigators, because the gunman had shot Mr. Nemtsov in the back as the couple walked side by side.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Nemtsov, 55, a longstanding proponent of democratic reforms who had been in and out of jail, crumpled on the sidewalk. By the time she looked back, she said, she saw neither the gunman\u2019s face, nor the license plate of the getaway car. She ran to a nearby snowplow, she said, to ask for help, then returned to the body and waited, by her account, about 10 minutes for the police.\n\nThe relationship of the older, famous politician and the young model from a country many Russians now believe to be their enemy has drawn intense interest from Russia\u2019s tabloid press.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Investigative Committee, the law enforcement organization with the lead on the case, has said it was examining a variety of possible motives, including that fellow members of the opposition killed him to create a martyr and that Islamist terrorists might be to blame, or that conflicts in his personal life might be the root.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian nationalist politician, for example, said of Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s romantic life, \u201cThis young girl was not the first.\u201d Mr. Zhirinvosky said his former colleague in Parliament \u201cwas always changing his partners, changing wives.\u201d\n\nMs. Duritskaya, in the interview, denied that either of them had received threats from jealous former lovers.\n\nKomsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, citing investigators, reported that Ms. Duritskaya had \u201cforgotten\u201d crucial moments of the shooting on a bridge over the Moscow River, and cited unidentified experts saying that investigators might have to wait until she underwent psychological treatment to overcome shock.\n\nAsked in the Dozhd interview what had happened on the bridge, Ms. Duritskaya said flatly \u201con the bridge, the murder of Boris took place.\u201d\n\nShe added that the investigators had not prohibited her from talking about the killing, though it remained an open question whether she might speak more freely once outside the country.\n\nLifeNews, one Russian television station that has delved into the relationship, interviewed a friend of Ms. Duritskaya\u2019s, who said the couple \u201cwere really tied by genuine feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey started to live together almost immediately,\u201d the station cited the friend, identified only by her first name, Yulia, as saying. \u201cThe couple was almost never apart.\u201d\n\nMs. Duritskaya had found some success in Kiev, working for the agencies Amodels and Kiev-Casting, appearing in online advertisements.\n\nWhen war came to their countries, Mr. Nemtsov met with the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, who later said he had tried to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between the two nations in conflict. He was killed just days before he was to lead a rally to protest the war in Ukraine."}
