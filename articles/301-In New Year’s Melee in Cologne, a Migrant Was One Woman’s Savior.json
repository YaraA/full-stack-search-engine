{"title": "In New Year\u2019s Melee in Cologne, a Migrant Was One Woman\u2019s Savior", "authors": ["Alison Smale"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/world/europe/in-new-years-melee-in-cologne-a-migrant-was-one-womans-savior.html", "body": "Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, a former primary-school teacher, said he had left Aleppo, a scene of tremendous fighting in the Syrian civil war, in 2014 for Turkey, and had arrived in Germany via the Balkans and Austria in September. He said he had left his wife and two sons in a village near the Syrian-Turkish border and was living in a small town near Cologne with two other Syrians, studying German as he awaited asylum.\n\nHe said in a telephone interview on Friday that he and his friends had also felt unsafe on New Year\u2019s, and blamed \u201cbad boys\u201d who were \u201cdrinking, and I think taking marijuana or something. They lost their minds.\u201d Now, they worry that Germans and other Europeans are drawing conclusions that will make it harder for new arrivals.\n\n\u201cWe keep hearing news about refugees all day: \u2018They are bad people, they must go back to their home,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, 32, said. \u201cWhen I hear that in the news, I am sad. Because we know that there were bad boys and bad people. But the good people, nobody speak about them.\u201d\n\nMs. Duncan\u2019s story started like so many others. In a long telephone conversation from T\u00fcbingen, a south German university town where she and Mr. Samer study neuroscience, she recounted the horror.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cOne man grabbed my hat, took it off my head,\u201d she began. \u201cSomeone else came around the back of me and grabbed me,\u201d she added, \u201cI guess looking for something in my pockets. I turned around, you know, to push him off me because he\u2019s touching me. I turned to get my hat back, put it on; someone else tried to kiss my face and to kiss my neck. I pushed him away and yelled, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018This is a bit strange, but it\u2019s New Year\u2019s and people are drinking too much \u2014 I\u2019ll just find my boyfriend and leave,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Duncan said.\n\nBut the police brushed her off and alarmed her more, she said, by shoving the crowd from the square.\n\nShe asked an American who was filming the scene if it was a political protest, and he speculated that the officers might be trying to thwart some kind of terrorist attack.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After that, we have new friends from Germany,\u201d the kind of contacts needed, he said, to start life here.\n\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d Ms. Duncan said, \u201cit turned out really well\u201d \u2014 even if \u201cthat was not how I planned to ring in the new year, definitely.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, a former primary-school teacher, said he had left Aleppo, a scene of tremendous fighting in the Syrian civil war, in 2014 for Turkey, and had arrived in Germany via the Balkans and Austria in September.
