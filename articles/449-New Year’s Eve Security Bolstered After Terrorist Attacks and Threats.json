The festivities, which typically draw hundreds of thousands of people, will go on, but backpacks, bags, suitcases, folding chairs, glass bottles, fireworks, megaphones and laser pointers have been banned. There will be 900 police officers and 600 security stewards on site, the news agency reported, the highest number ever.\n\nVienna\n\nThe authorities in Austria said they had received a warning on Saturday from a \u201cfriendly\u201d foreign intelligence service about possible terrorist attacks on New Year\u2019s Eve in European cities. They have not disclosed details, but the authorities have not called off the usual festivities in Austria, known for its New Year\u2019s Eve balls. Hundreds of police officers, including some from special security units, will be deployed throughout the capital.\n\nPhoto\n\nMoscow\n\nRed Square will be closed to the public, although the Russian authorities said the move had nothing to do with security issues. Instead, entry to the square will be limited to guests invited to a recording of a concert by the state television network Channel One. Alexey Mayorov, the city\u2019s security chief, told Agence France-Presse that the message from the police would be that the \u201cRed Square is closed for an event, and that there are a lot of other places around where people can have a wonderful time.\u201d But a former lawmaker, Alexander Klyukin, told Kommersant radio that the move was \u201cthe same as closing off Times Square in New York.\u201d\n\nMadrid\n\nFor the first time, the authorities have imposed limits on the number of people who will be allowed to attend festivities at Puerta del Sol square in Madrid (tens of thousands of people traditionally gather there to eat 12 grapes to coincide with the 12 chimes of the clock), El Pa\u00eds reported. About 600 police officers, firefighters and paramedics will be stationed in the center of the Spanish capital, where the police will be carrying out bag and body searches.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
