Germany and the European Union are \u201cplaying nice\u201d with Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Techau said, \u201cwhen they pretty much all disdain him. It is an enormous political compromise. It is not pretty at all. But in the end, there really is not much else left.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel has also shifted on the refugee issue, said Daniela Schwarzer, director of the Europe program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, she is changing the very liberal and nonconditional stance that she took in the summer, when she said we will take in the Syrians, we need to,\u201d Dr. Schwarzer said. \u201cThe rhetoric has changed.\u201d\n\nBeyond the shortage of physical shelter and needing to use volunteers to provide refugee care that was once regarded as a state task, Ms. Merkel is keenly aware not just of the slide in her approval ratings \u2014 from 75 percent last spring to about 50 percent now \u2014 but also of the rise of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party.\n\nThe party now regularly polls above the 5 percent hurdle any party must clear to get into state or federal parliaments. In eastern Germany, the anti-Islam Pegida movement, once fading from view, draws thousands to weekly marches in Dresden.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Leftists who have criticized her last week praised her steadfastness in sheltering the needy. In a speech to Parliament, the chancellor said that it would be a \u201cgigantic mistake,\u201d and that history would not forgive Germans, if they gave up on the refugee crisis after just a few months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConservatives have called ever louder for a limit, and \u2014 less publicly \u2014 muttered about replacing Ms. Merkel, who just completed a decade in power.\n\nYet there are few if any alternatives, and there is little sign so far that Ms. Merkel will face much overt hostility at the December congress of her Christian Democratic party, after a public scolding from her conservative Bavarian partner at his party\u2019s congress in Munich this month.\n\nEven after the Paris attacks, older Germans in particular fear a shift to the right in their country more than Islamist terrorism, from which they have so far been spared a large attack.\n\n\u201cMy great fear is that there is a big lurch rightwards,\u201d said Dietrich Roth, 63, a retired official from Aachen who was in Berlin to attend a seminar. Another attendee, Dieter Wittig, 74, of Cologne, noted \u2014 as many Germans currently do \u2014 that the country \u201cis split into two camps.\u201d One camp, susceptible to rightist scaremongers, already fears \u201cthat the influx is not stopping, and that millions more are just sitting on packed suitcases,\u201d he said.\n\nA greater influx would most likely strengthen nationalist and populist tendencies in countries like Poland and France, Germany\u2019s most important neighbors.\n\nIn France, the National Front of Marine Le Pen is likely to do well in regional elections in December. Poland has already elected a conservative government, which has broken its predecessor\u2019s promises of accepting a few thousand refugees, Dr. Schwarzer said.\n\nAn agreement to distribute 160,000 refugees among European Union countries is foundering, although Ms. Merkel has repeatedly cast it as essential.\n\nThis week, what has become a familiar ploy played out. Ms. Merkel rejected quotas for refugees. A day later, her interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, contradicted her, telling the Austrian daily Der Standard that Europe should set an annual intake per country and bar new entries once those quotas were met.\n\nMr. de Maizi\u00e8re\u2019s suggestion \u201cis clearly a way to introduce the notion of upper limits,\u201d without appearing to cave to Bavaria, Dr. Schwarzer said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConsensus will become ever more vital as Europe wrestles with the multiple challenges of refugees, Islamist terror and war in Syria and Ukraine. Germany, still wary of military engagement abroad, took almost two weeks after the Paris attacks to offer air surveillance, a frigate and refueling aircraft for the French assault on the Islamic State, Dr. Schwarzer said.", "summary": "Ms. Merkel has also shifted on the refugee issue, said Daniela Schwarzer, director of the Europe program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
