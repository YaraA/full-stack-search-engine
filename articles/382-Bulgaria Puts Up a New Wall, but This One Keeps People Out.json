Parties espousing ethnic nationalism are seeing their support rise, some to the point where they threaten the dominance of more traditional parties.\n\n\u201cThe rise of the right wing in Europe is a reaction to this refugee flow,\u201d said Boris B. Cheshirkov, chief spokesman in Bulgaria for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nAnd with much of Europe still struggling to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the higher costs of caring for this flood of refugees \u2014 especially in countries like Bulgaria, the poorest member of the European Union \u2014 are straining national budgets.\n\nAt the same time, episodes like the January attack on the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo are raising worries that both homegrown jihadists and foreign fighters will cloak themselves in this refugee flood.\n\n\u201cRight now, in the western part of Turkey, on the borders of Greece and Bulgaria, you probably have thousands of Syrian refugees waiting for an occasion to cross,\u201d said Marc Pierini, an expert on Turkey and the Middle East at Carnegie Europe, a foreign policy analysis group. \u201cIf you talk about returning jihadists, you are talking about dozens.\u201d\n\nSlavcho Velkov, a Bulgarian security expert and university lecturer, said he believed there was more jihadist movement through Bulgaria than the authorities acknowledged.\n\n\u201cI have seen such fighters here with my own eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cI spotted some at the central bus station and struck up a conversation. When I asked them where they were going, they said, \u2018We are going to heaven.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo some degree, efforts like the new Bulgarian fence simply contribute to a game of Whac-a-Mole: When one route is cut off, smugglers shift to other paths into Europe.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, heightened security was implemented along the Greek border with Turkey, including the building of a fence,\u201d said Gil Arias Fern\u00e1ndez, deputy executive director of Frontex, the agency that coordinates border protection throughout the European Union. \u201cThe result was that flow changed towards the Bulgarian border.\u201d\n\nIt was this deluge that caused Bulgaria to institute its own \u201ccontainment plan\u201d in November 2013, including the continuing construction of the border fence, which will eventually stretch 100 miles.\n\nThe impact was dramatic. The number of known illegal crossings fell to about 4,000 in 2014 from 11,000 the previous year.\n\nBut that did not mean that refugees were not getting into Europe, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez said. Those thousands who failed to cross into Bulgaria were offset by larger numbers crossing from Turkey by sea to the nearby Greek islands. Smaller numbers tried making it to Bulgaria across the Black Sea.\n\nROMANIA 100 Miles SERBIA Danube BULGARIA Black Sea Sofia Lesovo Hamzabeyli Istanbul GREECE Aegean Sea TURKEY\n\nMore than 170,000 refugees \u2014 most of them from the Middle East, Africa and Afghanistan \u2014 entered Europe on the sea route to southern Italy in 2014. In the first two months of this year, the number was up 42 percent over the same period last year.\n\nHere in the eastern Mediterranean, where Frontex measures land and sea crossings into Bulgaria and Greece, the number of those entering is up 107 percent over last year \u2014 with the raw number of those crossing, 5,275, approaching the 7,834 who used the Italian sea route.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting a surge of refugees in April and May for certain,\u201d said Jordan Malidov, director of a Bulgarian refugee center in the town of Harmanli, 22 miles north of the Turkish border. Warmer weather emboldens those trying risky sea crossings or attempting to walk across remote, green borders.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was actually two fences, stretching across the entire land border, with a 500-meter minefield between them, designed to prevent residents of Communist nations from sneaking into the West.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe fence was dismantled piece by piece, he said, \u201cand we very carefully removed each of the mines, one by one.\u201d\n\nNow, as a professor of national and international security at New Bulgarian University, Mr. Radulov is watching with some disbelief as the new barrier rises to take its place.\n\n\u201cThe theory then was that it was antidemocratic to have these kind of devices along the border,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd of course, we were good democrats.\u201d\n\nThe new fence is rising on a rocky ridge, below which a pencil-thin minaret pokes through the rooftops of Hamzabeyli village in a gentle elbow of northern Turkey\u2019s green hills.\n\n\u201cWe post the men 100 meters apart,\u201d said Hristo Stefanov, the chief of the border patrol office responsible for this stretch of the frontier, pointing down a rutted road toward a distant man in black. \u201cThat way, you see, the officers are always in sight of one another.\u201d\n\nImmediately behind him was the western end of the 12-foot-high metal fence that rolls along the stony hilltop until it disappears around a distant line of gnarled trees. The fence, on the Bulgarian side, consists of chicken wire in a steel frame, while a menacing cascade of razor wire climbs its Turkish face.\n\nOnly this first section is in place, along the stretch where most refugees tried to avoid border checkpoints. But the Bulgarian government, drawing on money from the European Union and other sources, and eager to prove it can effectively control its southern flank, says it will begin later this month to extend the wall until it covers the entire 100-mile land border with Turkey not already blocked by the Rezovo River.\n\nOne reason Bulgarian officials are keen to complete the wall is to demonstrate to European leaders that the country deserves to be admitted into the Schengen group of nations whose members do not require visas or passports to travel between them. Bulgaria was admitted to the European Union in 2007, but has been denied Schengen approval, partly because of border issues.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the Bulgarian government contends that the wall will be finished this summer, few security experts believe this is possible. Construction has not begun, and roads must first be carved through the forbidding, often mountainous landscape.\n\nIn the meantime, refugees will continue to find ways across the border at more remote and dangerous locations.\n\nAbout 4,000 refugees are living in centers like the one in Harmanli, which holds 1,600.\n\nTahani Halad Hamza, 21, was studying biology in Mosul, Iraq, when the fighting erupted there. Her father was lost in the conflict, but she, her husband, her mother and two brothers managed to make it into Turkey and as far as the Bulgarian border, where they were taken into custody about six months ago.\n\nNow what is left of the family lives in a small, red-and-white trailer in the refugee center. Like others in the facility, they said they hoped to be granted official refugee status by the Bulgarian government, which would allow them to travel through Europe.\n\nHer family hopes to get to Germany, she said, or perhaps Britain.\n\n\u201cThe only difference between Bulgaria and Syria is the conflict,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no work in either place.\u201d\n\nHer mother leaned forward with wide eyes, \u201cSyria,\u201d she said. \u201cBoom, boom, boom!\u201d"}
