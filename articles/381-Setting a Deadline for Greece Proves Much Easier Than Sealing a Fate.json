Seeing no benefit yet to getting out in front on an issue with historic implications, no one of stature has stepped up to say definitively that Greece must go. Equally, no one with clout has stepped in to stop the forces \u2014 notably Greece\u2019s steady drift into bankruptcy \u2014 that could compel it to leave.\n\nGreek banks have all been shut since June 29. The country has joined a roster of failing states like Zimbabwe and Sudan and defaulted on loans from the International Monetary Fund. A.T.M.s, limited to dispensing just 60 euros a day per person, are fast running out of cash, raising the prospect that Greece may soon start issuing I.O.U.s, effectively creating an unofficial second currency to keep the wheels of business turning.\n\nWhether this situation improves or gets even much worse is in the hands of the European Central Bank, which has the power to increase or cease an already-capped flow of emergency cash to Greek banks.\n\nWithout this, Greece would almost certainly have to resort to form sort of scrip that could end up as a new national currency.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is trapped between her desire to hold Europe together and intense domestic pressures not to make any concessions to the Greeks over funding.\n\nThe top officials of European institutions in Brussels are loath to set a bad precedent by giving in to Greece\u2019s call for softer terms on new bailout money.\n\nBut they are equally concerned that a decisive break would have grave consequences for the European experiment in shared sovereignty, at a time when Britain is weighing its own departure from the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tsipras himself has insisted he wants to avoid a \u201crupture\u201d with Europe and its currency union but heads a fractious radical party whose powerful left flank, emboldened by a referendum last Sunday rejecting creditors\u2019 earlier terms, demanded on Wednesday that Greece stand firm even if that means issuing its own currency.\n\nAnd nobody seems to really know whether it is possible, at least legally, to expel Greece from a monetary club it joined in 2001, or if Greece can quit of its own accord, a situation that once prompted a prominent British politician and onetime foreign secretary William Hague, to call the euro a \u201cburning building with no exits.\u201d\n\nAll major European leaders, however, now agree that they have reached a crunch point. It\u2019s a crucial juncture that Margaret Thatcher, denouncing what she regarded as a doomed monetary project more than 25 years ago, predicted would inevitably come, but that even zealous supporters of the project now see as just four days away.\n\n\u201cTonight I have to say it loud and clear \u2014 the final deadline ends this week,\u201d Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, declared late Tuesday after another day of result-free talks in Brussels on how to save Greece from economic collapse and ensure that it stays with the euro.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some Syriza members, like Dimitrios Papadimoulis, of the European Parliament, say they want to end all talk of Greece leaving the euro. Speaking in Strasbourg on Wednesday, he pleaded with European leaders to \u201cdo whatever it takes to banish the word \u2018Grexit\u2019 from the vocabulary,\u201d and asked them to \u201cstop playing with matches in a warehouse full of fuel.\u201d\n\nThen there is the Left Platform, a radical group of Syriza deputies in Athens whose website recommended on Wednesday that Greece \u201c\u201dfollow the great \u2018no\u2019 of the referendum to the very end.\u201d Greece, said this group, must stand up to German calls for tight spending even though a German refusal to budge on its demands for budget cuts in return for bailout money would \u201cpush Greece in the direction of a national currency.\u201d\n\nGermany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy and de facto leader, is trying to maintain a united front with France, which along with the United States has been pressing for a deal to hold the euro together.\n\nBut at home, Ms. Merkel, who has for years asserted that defending the currency union is Germany\u2019s \u201chistoric task,\u201d is confronting growing resistance to further bailouts for Greece. If Germany agrees to a third bailout, conservatives in her center-right bloc will feel their principles are \u201cmore than betrayed,\u201d said Peter Ramsauer, chairman of the economics committee in the Bundestag and an influential member of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, sister party to Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats.\n\nBut it is not clear that there is a legal mechanism for failure.\n\nEuropean law has no provisions that let members of the club that uses the euro, now numbering 19 nations, expel an unruly member, nor is there a procedure for a member to exit of its own accord, since the decision to join was supposed to be irrevocable.", "summary": "Nearly everyone involved faces a mix of domestic political constraints, European and global responsibilities, ideological differences and a deep distrust built up over months of fruitless and often ill-tempered negotiations since Mr. Tsipras and his radical party, Syriza, took power in Greece in January. \u201cTonight I have to say it loud and clear \u2014 the final deadline ends this week,\u201d Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, declared late Tuesday after another day of result-free talks in Brussels on how to save Greece from economic collapse and ensure that it stays with the euro.
