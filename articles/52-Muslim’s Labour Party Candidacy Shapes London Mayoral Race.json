Mr. Khan\u2019s closest rival is Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative candidate, who says he wants to make London \u201cthe greenest city in the world.\u201d\n\nThe two have battled over issues like transportation and how to build more homes to relieve London\u2019s sky-high real estate and rental costs. Mr. Khan points to the fact that the average rent in London is equivalent to 55 pounds, or about $80, a night \u2014 the price of a decent hotel in many European capitals. And Mr. Goldsmith has said the overcrowded conditions endured by London commuters \u201cwould be illegal for chickens, pigs and cattle.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, perhaps, for a globalized city that accommodates the extremes of wealth, Mr. Khan and Mr. Goldsmith are living examples of London\u2019s diversity.\n\nMr. Goldsmith, 41, a son of the tycoon Sir James Goldsmith, inherited a fortune and was educated at Eton College, Britain\u2019s most exclusive school. He edited the magazine The Ecologist, founded by his uncle, and was elected to Parliament in 2010.\n\nThe fight between the two main contenders has not been pretty, bringing delicate issues of ethnicity and religion into a mayoral election in a way never seen here before.\n\nMr. Goldsmith has described Mr. Khan as dangerous and without principle and said it was his job to do everything he could \u201cto prevent London falling into the wrong hands.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

My point is: What experience does he have to be mayor of London? What is his vision? What are his values?\u201d\n\nMr. Goldsmith says his privileged upbringing is irrelevant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to be in a wheelchair to know that it is not just that people in wheelchairs can\u2019t use our public transport system,\u201d he said in an interview, describing efforts he has made to improve access to the subway system. \u201cYou either care about issues or you don\u2019t, and if you do you solve them, and I have done that.\u201d\n\nMr. Goldsmith has also attacked Mr. Khan over policy shifts \u2014 including his newfound opposition to the expansion of Heathrow Airport near London \u2014 and what he criticizes as opportunism because Mr. Khan, who nominated Mr. Corbyn in last year\u2019s Labour Party leadership contest, did not vote for him and has since distanced himself from his party leader.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Heathrow, Mr. Khan said that as a government minister, and then as opposition spokesman, he had accepted a collective position favoring expansion, but that he had changed his mind because of new evidence about air pollution.\n\nThe personalization of the campaign underlines the lack of deep policy differences confronting Londoners, analysts said.\n\nNeither candidate has challenged London\u2019s existing model of openness to immigration and investment, allied to rapid economic growth, said Tony Travers, the director of a research group on London at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nIn policy terms, \u201cit is hard to argue that they are radically different from each other,\u201d he said.", "summary": "But the main policy battles being fought on the streets of London relate to the problems confronting a city that has an acute shortage of affordable housing and a creaking and overcrowded mass transit network.
