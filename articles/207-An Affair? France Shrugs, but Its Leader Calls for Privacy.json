The two have four children together. He strongly supported her unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2007, and they appeared together as a couple throughout the race before splitting publicly immediately afterward.\n\nMore recently, he has been in a relationship with Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, a journalist for the magazine Paris Match who has acted as France\u2019s first lady since Mr. Hollande\u2019s election in 2012. Their relationship began while Ms. Trierweiler was covering Mr. Hollande for the magazine. Ms. Royal and Ms. Trierweiler had engaged in a highly public rivalry that was made particularly plain when, on Twitter, Ms. Trierweiler supported a candidate running in a legislative election against Ms. Royal, who had received the backing of Mr. Hollande. That incident caused a minor political scandal, and Ms. Trierweiler\u2019s Twitter activity has been somewhat less adventuresome since.\n\nCloser, a weekly tabloid that in 2012 drew the ire of the British royal family for publishing topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge, the former Kate Middleton, published an article and a collection of photos on Friday that it said documented Mr. Hollande\u2019s meetings with the actress, Julie Gayet, 41.\n\nThe photos appear to show Mr. Hollande and his security detail coming and going by motorcycle on several occasions from the apartment. Ms. Gayet can be seen entering the same building. The photos show a man said to be Mr. Hollande \u2014 the man was always photographed wearing a helmet with a full visor \u2014 arriving at the building. In one photo, a man in an overcoat with his helmet on is shown as he leaves the building. Mr. Hollande and Ms. Gayet are not shown together.\n\nRumors of a relationship between the two had circulated for months in Paris, and last year Ms. Gayet went so far as to seek a court injunction to make them stop. On Friday, Closer said it would remove the photos from its website in response to a request from Ms. Gayet.\n\nMs. Trierweiler made no public comment on the report, and the status of her relationship with Mr. Hollande remained unclear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Gayet, who has two children and is said to be separated from her husband, an Argentine film director, has mostly acted in independent films and has played mainly secondary roles, as well as producing some of her own movies. She has played a drug addict, a blind woman, a lesbian and a hairdresser, and in articles about her films she has been praised by directors for her professionalism and artistic choices. She was an active supporter of Mr. Hollande during his presidential campaign.\n\nPhoto\n\nSpeaking Friday morning on Europe 1 radio, Laurence Pieau, the top editor at Closer, called Mr. Hollande a \u201cnormal president\u201d and \u201ca normal person.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a president who\u2019s fallen in love,\u201d Ms. Pieau said. \u201cWe really need to undramatize these images.\u201d\n\nThe reaction of French people, many of whom said they had already heard the rumor before the magazine\u2019s report, was much the same as Ms. Pieau\u2019s.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Several recent presidents have been widely rumored to have had affairs that the news media have avoided publicizing.\n\nA century ago, President F\u00e9lix Faure expired in the presidential palace at age 58 while engaging in some extramarital sport with a young woman. (Newspapers at the time did not make explicit the circumstances of his death, but one suggested with a wink that Mr. Faure had been \u201csacrificed to Venus,\u201d the Roman goddess of love.)\n\nPhoto\n\nNow, a combination of factors, including the Internet and the very public soap opera around former President Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s divorce and subsequent marriage to a model-turned-singer, Carla Bruni, has changed the news media\u2019s appetite for intimate glimpses into the lives of powerful men.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first significant shift in the news media\u2019s approach came in 1994, when Paris Match published photos of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand with Mazarine Pingeot, his daughter from a long-running affair. Ms. Pingeot\u2019s existence had been kept hidden from the public but was an open secret among French journalists.\n\nThe 2011 arrest on sexual assault charges of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then the head of the International Monetary Fund, exposed the potential dangers of the news media\u2019s silence. The legal case against him and subsequent accounts from other women forced a debate about the French news media\u2019s deference to powerful figures over sex.\n\nHowever, the debate died down, and the question of how much the news media should say about private lives has not been resolved.\n\nIn interviews, several people said they were comfortable having Mr. Hollande keep his romantic liaison out of public view.\n\nA financial officer at an industrial company, Alexandre Pasquier, 33, said: \u201cThe split between private life and public life is very important to me,\u201d adding, \u201cThis does not involve a political problem.\u201d\n\nMr. Pasquier said that although he did not approve of infidelity \u201con a moral plane,\u201d Mr. Hollande\u2019s apparent affair would not affect either the president\u2019s ability to run the country or the French population\u2019s view of him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stain his image,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has so many other things going badly, this won\u2019t hurt him. It could even maybe give him a boost.\u201d", "summary": "Now, a combination of factors, including the Internet and the very public soap opera around former President Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s divorce and subsequent marriage to a model-turned-singer, Carla Bruni, has changed the news media\u2019s appetite for intimate glimpses into the lives of powerful men.The first significant shift in the news media\u2019s approach came in 1994, when Paris Match published photos of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand with Mazarine Pingeot, his daughter from a long-running affair.The 2011 arrest on sexual assault charges of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then the head of the International Monetary Fund, exposed the potential dangers of the news media\u2019s silence.The legal case against him and subsequent accounts from other women forced a debate about the French news media\u2019s deference to powerful figures over sex.Mr. Pasquier said that although he did not approve of infidelity \u201con a moral plane,\u201d Mr. Hollande\u2019s apparent affair would not affect either the president\u2019s ability to run the country or the French population\u2019s view of him."}
