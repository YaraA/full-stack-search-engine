{"title": "After Attack on German Train, Fears Over Refugees, and From Them, Too", "authors": ["Rick Lyman"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/world/europe/germany-train-attack-refugees.html", "body": "After hundreds of sexual assaults on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne apparently involving male migrants from North Africa, Germany was convulsed over whether such ugly cultural clashes would become standard fare in a country that accepted more than 800,000 asylum seekers last year from the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nNow, the concern is that this apparent lone-wolf attack on strangers riding a regional train could inspire a fresh round of second-guessing about whether Germany had made a fatal error in accepting so many immigrants.\n\n\u201cIt was only one lonely person who did this,\u201d said Heiko Clajus, who was also in the park and who works on a series of memorial projects at the site of the former Buchenwald concentration camp on the outskirts of Weimar.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really pin this on refugees in general and say, \u2018Oh, all refugees are responsible and must be feared,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut it is troubling that we had such an incident in Germany.\u201d\n\nThe young attacker on the train has not been identified by officials, but he was widely named in the German news media as Riaz Khan Ahmadzai.\n\nOn Wednesday, Germany\u2019s federal police said they had confirmed the authenticity of a video attributed to him by the Islamic State, which called him one of its soldiers.\n\n\u201cThe foster family were able to identify it, that he had filmed it in the room in their home where he had lived, in that they recognized the background,\u201d Joachim Herrmann, interior minister for the state of Bavaria, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe are absolutely sure, the video is authentic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe assessment supports the idea that the teenager had been radicalized quickly; he moved in with the family only several weeks ago.\n\nThomas de Maizi\u00e8re, Germany\u2019s interior minister, spoke of the attacker as having been \u201cincited\u201d by Islamic State propaganda. But he played down the significance of the video, describing it as being similar to a normal suicide video.\n\n\u201cThis is perhaps a case that falls into the gray zone between a rampage and an act of terror,\u201d Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said.\n\nBefore this week, the young man had shown no signs of violence. He arrived in Germany last year as an unaccompanied minor, saying he was from Afghanistan, although officials now say he may have been from Pakistan.\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nHe had appeared to be integrating well, having been placed in foster care rather than in a group home. But apparently, after news of the death of a close friend back home last week, he became disturbed and rapidly radicalized, German officials said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d said Rainer Wernicke, leader of the Green Party for the state of Thuringia, which includes Weimar, as he also wandered through the sun-baked park in the center of the city. \u201cThe atmosphere in this country is not comforting.\u201d\n\nMr. Wernicke said he expected the attack to have a \u201csimilar impact\u201d to that of the Cologne assaults \u2014 making Germans more wary of accepting Muslim refugees and strengthening the hand of anti-immigrant parties.\n\nPeter Altmaier, the chief of staff for Chancellor Angela Merkel, said in an interview on German television that, despite Monday\u2019s attack, all available evidence showed that refugees were no more likely to be involved in violent episodes than anyone else.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMost of the terrorists who have carried out attacks in Europe over the past few months were not refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were people who were born here and who grew up here.\u201d\n\nBut a statement by the Alternative for Germany, a right-wing party that has gained ground politically this year with its hard-line anti-immigrant stance, quickly tied the train attack to Ms. Merkel\u2019s \u201cwelcoming policies,\u201d which, the party said, \u201chad brought too many young, uneducated and radical Muslim men to Germany.\u201d\n\nCem Ozdemir, a national chairman of Alliance \u201990/The Greens, said that if people did descend into fear and took out their worries on refugees, it would be counterproductive, giving Islamic radicals exactly the outcome they desired.\n\nGermany, he said, is at a crossroads. It can react \u201cirrationally,\u201d by building up its \u201cpolice state\u201d to contain and control the migrants, or it can act \u201cwith rationality,\u201d by exchanging intelligence more freely with other European nations to help identify violent and radicalized people before they strike.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

No single country can tackle this alone. We need Europe to do that.\u201d\n\nLike cities across Germany, Weimar, famous as the center of Germany\u2019s literary golden age, home to Goethe and Schiller, has had to accept its allotted batch of refugees \u2014 about 900 of them in Weimar\u2019s case.\n\nOne of them, Lemar Poya, 25, from Afghanistan, lounged on a blanket in the shade at the park, munching on picnic food prepared by Syrian women.\n\nMr. Poya said he worried that some of the Germans he had met in the months he had been in Weimar would now see him differently.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was very sad, and concerned,\u201d he said about his feelings upon hearing of the attack. \u201cWill all Afghans be blamed? I hope not. All I want is to learn the German language and to get work and make a life here.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging that a terrorism-related episode was possible \u2014 perhaps likely \u2014 many Germans had consoled themselves that, before Monday, there had been none of the type of violence that has hit France and Belgium.\n\nThey saw it as a consequence of Germany\u2019s being more welcoming and integrating than those countries. Now, though, they are not so sure.\n\n\u201cI am really sad right now, because I thought Germany wouldn\u2019t be the target of such attacks anytime soon, because Germany has tried so hard to help the refugees,\u201d said Micha Ott, a graphic designer. \u201cNow, I hope it won\u2019t get harder for the refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwe have to face the fact that with this happening here in Germany, the Germans are frightened now.\u201d", "summary": "Now, the concern is that this apparent lone-wolf attack on strangers riding a regional train could inspire a fresh round of second-guessing about whether Germany had made a fatal error in accepting so many immigrants.
