A decade of fighting alongside the Americans in Afghanistan has only increased British popular unhappiness with overseas engagements, especially as a junior partner to Washington.\n\nMr. Miliband has been boasting that he showed his \u201ctoughness\u201d not in the face of Russia or the Islamic State but \u201cby standing up to the leader of the free world,\u201d President Obama, over the possibility of bombing Syria.\n\nAs Anthony King writes in a new book \u201cWho Governs Britain?\u201d successive governments have cut military spending but still use the language of a world power. \u201cSince they cannot punch above their weight, they talk above it instead,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAfter an early and ill-fated foray in Libya, Mr. Cameron has emphasized Britain\u2019s economic needs, pushing the Foreign Office and the Treasury to use British influence to enhance trade. On numerous occasions, Mr. Cameron has overruled the Foreign Office\u2019s hesitation about getting too close to China for the sake of British economic interests.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost recently, Mr. Cameron went against Foreign Office advice and, without much warning to Washington, announced that Britain would break with the United States and be a founding member of Beijing\u2019s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, considered a rival to the American-led World Bank. As Washington feared, the British decision was quickly matched by Germany, France, Italy and South Korea.\n\nIn the interests of trade with China, Britain has been tepid about pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. After meeting the Dalai Lama in May 2012, prompting the usual heated complaints from Beijing, Mr. Cameron has not done so again. China\u2019s Global Times commented that Britain \u201cshould acknowledge that the U.K. is not a big power in the eyes of the Chinese \u2014 it is just an old European country apt for travel and study.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBritain has also seemed absent on Ukraine. Although a signatory with the United States and Russia on the 1994 agreement that promised Ukraine territorial sovereignty in return for giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons, Mr. Cameron was not involved in the Minsk negotiations with Russian and Ukrainian leaders.\n\nBritain has joined the American-led coalition against the Islamic State, but only in Iraq, not in Syria. Despite concerns about the numbers of British citizens going to join ISIS, the British contribution has been modest, a few sorties a day, said Ivo Daalder, a former American ambassador to NATO.\n\nBritain has also been relatively inactive against Boko Haram in Nigeria, though it did provide considerable medical and other aid to countries hit by the spread of Ebola. But it has done little to help the French fight Islamic extremists in Mali.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So it\u2019s a double whammy.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Daalder, now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, \u201cthis is not a momentary blip, but a trend. A country that for decades punched well above its weight is not at its weight, or even below it. From World War II, Britain was our most important military ally. It was our ally in the Europe Union. And militarily, we assumed whatever we got involved in, Britain would be there.\u201d\n\nNow, Mr. Daalder said, \u201call that has changed.\u201d\n\nIn The Spectator magazine, retired Vice Adm. Sir Jeremy Blackham and retired Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon argued that fighting ability had been \u201cmassively reduced.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cConsider the glaring gaps in our capabilities,\u201d they wrote. \u201cNo maritime patrol aircraft, loss of combat power in the Royal Navy, just three squadrons of Tornado ground attack aircraft\u201d and \u201cmajor manpower weaknesses.\u201d\n\nNow, Mr. Chollet said, \u201cother countries are filling the vacuum.\u201d Britain has \u201cnot been asserting its more traditional leadership role on the big questions of security. On Ukraine, it\u2019s Germany, and on the Mideast and Africa, it\u2019s increasingly France that we look to.\u201d\n\nIntelligence cooperation is a great exception, with close ties, from communications intercepts to spying.\n\nXenia Wickett, a former American official who directs the United States program at Chatham House, a policy institute, uses the three-legged stool analogy. The first leg is military and intelligence cooperation, the second is Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union, and the third is soft power, diplomatic wisdom and partnership.\n\n\u201cCuts in the British military mean the first leg is weakening, while Britain\u2019s possible exit from the E.U. means the second is weakening \u2014 and stools do not stand on one leg,\u201d she said.\n\nChristopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to Washington, is more sanguine, seeing a cycle in Britain\u2019s relationship with the United States, which since 1945, he said, \u201chas had a lot of volatility at the level of the White House and Downing Street.\u201d\n\nSome of Britain\u2019s inactivity has been sensible, Mr. Meyer said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased we were careful on Ukraine because there\u2019s not a lot we could have done there. The Germans and French have been extremely active and got nowhere.\u201d\n\nBritain remains deeply aware that \u201cas a permanent member of the Security Council we need to act from time to time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Russian bear flying up and down our coast has raised NATO from the dead, and it will impinge in British consciousness, too.\u201d\n\nThe French are also concerned, said Camille Grand, director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. \u201cWe in Paris understand that Germany is a complicated partner on defense, but the assumption is that Britain is a like-minded country ready to intervene, would spend enough on defense and remain a nuclear weapons state,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this is being challenged, and it makes Paris feel lonely.\u201d", "summary": "Mr. Miliband has been boasting that he showed his \u201ctoughness\u201d not in the face of Russia or the Islamic State but \u201cby standing up to the leader of the free world,\u201d President Obama, over the possibility of bombing Syria.After an early and ill-fated foray in Libya, Mr. Cameron has emphasized Britain\u2019s economic needs, pushing the Foreign Office and the Treasury to use British influence to enhance trade.China\u2019s Global Times commented that Britain \u201cshould acknowledge that the U.K. is not a big power in the eyes of the Chinese \u2014 it is just an old European country apt for travel and study.\u201dAlthough a signatory with the United States and Russia on the 1994 agreement that promised Ukraine territorial sovereignty in return for giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons, Mr. Cameron was not involved in the Minsk negotiations with Russian and Ukrainian leaders.Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to Washington, is more sanguine, seeing a cycle in Britain\u2019s relationship with the United States, which since 1945, he said, \u201chas had a lot of volatility at the level of the White House and Downing Street.\u201d"}
