{"title": "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon Blames \u2018Media Lynching\u2019 for His Campaign Crisis", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/world/europe/francois-fillon-france-election.html", "body": "As Mr. Fillon has plummeted in the polls, the presidential race has unexpectedly opened up to two maverick candidacies. The far-right National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen and an independent, Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister, are now seen as likely to face each other in a runoff in May.\n\nIf Ms. Le Pen wins, it could mean the disintegration of the European Union \u2014 she has vowed to hold a referendum on France\u2019s membership \u2014 and would be further evidence of the tide of authoritarian populism sweeping parts of the West.\n\nA Le Pen victory is still considered unlikely, but the political tides on both sides of the Atlantic have proved unpredictable, and the race is being closely watched for its potential impact across Europe.\n\nThe Socialist Party, tainted by the unpopular president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has been almost a nonfactor in the race. Mr. Fillon\u2019s fall now signals the cratering of both of France\u2019s establishment parties.\n\nIt looks like a catastrophe for his center-right Republican Party, which has no fallback candidate.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Fillon joked grimly that the only Plan B was \u201cB\u00e9r\u00e9zina\u201d \u2014 a reference to Napoleon\u2019s disastrous 1812 defeat in Russia. But it was far from clear that his performance on Monday, combative and pugnacious, would be enough to salvage his candidacy.\n\nHe mostly blamed the news media for his troubles, and he offered no proof that his wife had carried out substantive tasks \u2014 essentially merely repeating his first defense.\n\nMr. Fillon apologized to French voters for what he called an \u201cerror\u201d in employing her, but he noted that many other members of Parliament hired family members.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf the system needs to be reformed, reform it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are old practices that aren\u2019t acceptable.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But you can\u2019t steal their choice from them.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Fillon did not directly rebut suggestions by his wife, Penelope Fillon, made long before the scandal broke, that she had never done any work for him.\n\nIn 2007, after her husband became prime minister, Mrs. Fillon, who is of Welsh origin, told a British journalist that she had \u201cnever been his assistant.\u201d That interview, exhumed last week, severely hurt her husband\u2019s case.\n\nOn Monday, her husband was able to say only: \u201cShe was first and foremost my companion in work. She was discreet.\u201d\n\nHe said that she had handled \u201ccorrespondence\u201d and represented him in \u201ccultural manifestations\u201d in his district in rural western France. But there was no documentation of any work.\n\nAt the same time, the old interview with Mrs. Fillon revealed, poignantly, a politician\u2019s wife who had spent years in her husband\u2019s shadow. She felt that her intelligence and accomplishments were underused and worried about how her children perceived her.\n\n\u201cI realized that my children have only known me as just a mother,\u201d she was quoted as saying. \u201cBut I did a French degree, I qualified as a lawyer, and I thought, \u2018Look here, I\u2019m not that stupid.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Fillon is seen in much of the French news media as a victim in the scandal \u2014 perhaps exploited by a husband of modest means whose social circle nonetheless included moneyed aristocrats and others of wealth. Her husband said on Monday that his wife\u2019s remarks had been taken out of context.\n\nRepeatedly, Mr. Fillon expressed his contempt for and anger at the news media.\n\n\u201cThis campaign against me is defamatory,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of you has a question about the violence of these accusations against me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitically assassinate me, as you have done for 10 days now, that poses a real problem,\u201d Mr. Fillon said. \u201cBut the French are realizing this,\u201d he added, vowing to carry on with his campaign."}
