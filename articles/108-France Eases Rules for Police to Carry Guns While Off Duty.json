The number of returnees in France is about 244, one of the top French intelligence officials, Patrick Calvar, told lawmakers last month.\n\nVideo\n\nFrench officials did not respond specifically to Belgium\u2019s most recent warning of returning jihadists.\n\nBut Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France, speaking on France Inter radio Wednesday, made clear that the country must be prepared for more attacks.\n\n\u201cOther innocent people will lose their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could accuse me of making society even more anxious than it already is, given all the events that have happened. But sadly, this is the reality.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

France has maintained a state of emergency since the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, and considers the risk of attack high.\n\nHowever, French police officers were particularly on edge after stabbings on Monday of an off-duty officer and his companion, an Interior Ministry employee.\n\nThe country\u2019s police unions met with Interior Ministry officials on Wednesday and emerged saying they had received indefinite permission to carry their work guns, even when off duty.\n\nThey are permitted to do so now under state-of-emergency provisions, but those will expire on July 26. Many police officers had worried that the expiration would make them more vulnerable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe extended permission for off-duty carrying, given by Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister, is not permanent, but does not have an end date.\n\nA far less nervous and combative mood prevailed in Magnanville, the small town west of Paris where the stabbings took place. About 200 people gathered at noon on Wednesday for a moment of silence at the end of the street where the policeman lived with his family.\n\nThey listened quietly to remarks from the town\u2019s mayor and sang the national anthem, \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d Only a few of the mourners complained that France had too many mosques, a not-uncommon sentiment expressed in parts of France in response to fears of Islamic extremists.\n\nMen representing area Muslim groups came to pay their respects, standing a bit apart as if they were outsiders, although they were from neighboring towns.\n\nOne of them, Abdelaziz El Jaouhari, who is the secretary general for the Council of Muslims for the department of Yvelines, said France needed more proper mosques to help fight radicalism. A department is a local unit of government, similar to a county.\n\n\u201cWe do not have enough official places of prayer for the community, and it is much better for young people to be in official places of worship rather than with those networks they find in basements and I don\u2019t know where,\u201d Mr. Jaouhari said.", "summary": "Among the possible targets in Belgium were embassies, restaurants, hospitals, hotels, concert halls and pedestrian streets, according to the warning.However, with the Euro 2016 soccer tournament underway in France and drawing huge crowds to city centers and areas around stadiums, the report from Belgium was consistent with assessments by security officials that its neighbor faces a persistent and serious risk.In testimony before Belgium\u2019s Parliament on Wednesday, Justice Minister Koen Geens said that as of June 7, 114 Belgian fighters had returned from the Syrian-Iraqi conflict zone and that seven of them had since died.The country\u2019s police unions met with Interior Ministry officials on Wednesday and emerged saying they had received indefinite permission to carry their work guns, even when off duty.One of them, Abdelaziz El Jaouhari, who is the secretary general for the Council of Muslims for the department of Yvelines, said France needed more proper mosques to help fight radicalism."}
