When they set off, the boat, which he said had a capacity of 30 people, was packed with 36 adults and 15 children.\n\n\u201cThe motor couldn\u2019t handle the weight, and halfway into the journey it stopped working,\u201d Bilal recalled. \u201cThe next thing we knew, the boat had capsized and we were all in the freezing cold water.\u201d\n\nHis wife grabbed on to two of their children and attached their life jackets to his. He took the other child, but neither of them could swim and the strong current caused them to drift away from one another, he said.\n\n\u201cWe were in the water for over two hours before the coast guard came, and one by one, the people around us died.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBilal\u2019s son, Ibrahim, 6, started vomiting blood and his daughter lost consciousness, but the family survived. His cousin\u2019s three young children, who were also on the boat, were among the 18 passengers who died.\n\n\u201cDeath has become our destiny,\u201d said Kholoud, Bilal\u2019s wife. \u201cEither you die in Syria from shelling or you die at sea.\u201d\n\nAt least they survived. The full extent of the humanitarian crisis can be seen at Izmir\u2019s largest morgue, which recently exceeded capacity and is expanding its facility to make more room. Pictures of the deceased migrants show a majority of the victims to be children, some as young as 4 months.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe hardest part of this job is receiving the children,\u201d an official at the morgue said without giving his name because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. \u201cThey are at the age when they should be splashing about in the sea and playing, but instead their lifeless bodies are being washed up ashore one by one.\u201d\n\nHe explained that once the bodies of drowned migrants arrive at the morgue, they are kept for 15 days to allow families time to claim them. If they are not identified within that period, the forensics department carries out an autopsy and records the DNA.\n\nEach body is bathed and shrouded, in line with Islamic rites, before being sent to the cemetery where the imams carry out a full Islamic funeral.\n\n\u201cWe decided to give the migrants their own cemetery to make the identification process as easy as possible, even after the bodies are buried,\u201d Mr. Altan, the imam, said. \u201cWe have a whole system in place for the families to identify the bodies for up to 100 years.\u201d\n\nEuropean Refugee and Migrant Crisis\n\nThe four imams who work at the cemetery carry out an average of five funerals each a day, for Turkish citizens and migrants. They say that they are haunted by the number of unidentified migrant burials they have carried out in the past year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI broke down when I buried a 3-month old baby,\u201d Mr. Altan said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself. It\u2019s hard to accept, because these deaths can be prevented by politicians, but they won\u2019t stop and it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d\n\nAfter a three-day storm here, hundreds of migrants flocked to various departure points across the coast, desperate to leave before the next wave of bad weather. Qamar, a mother of three, clutched her 5-month-old baby as she stood by the window of a cafe, her eyes fixed on the sea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m terrified for my children, but this is a gamble we have to take,\u201d she said. \u201cMany people die, but many more make it. God will decide what happens to us.\u201d", "summary": "Increased patrols by the Turkish coast guard, plummeting temperatures and stormy seas \u2014 all factors that officials believed would lead to fewer crossings \u2014 have seemed to have little effect on the numbers.
