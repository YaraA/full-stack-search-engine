{"title": "A New Generation\u2019s Anger Resounds From a Packed Plaza in Paris", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/world/europe/france-nuit-debout-protests-paris.html", "body": "The French movement was born in anger at the government\u2019s attempt to overhaul France\u2019s ponderous labor code, in hopes of making it easier for employers to hire and provide jobs for just the kinds of young people who have now occupied the square. But the government\u2019s proposals also made it easier to fire.\n\nTo say that the plan backfired is an understatement. The answer from the younger generation trying to elbow its way into the work force was simple: We don\u2019t want what you are offering; we want what our parents have, and then some.\n\nAll through March students and unions took to the streets to demonstrate. The protests spread to the provinces. The government quickly backed down, gutting its own plan.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOur youth feel neglected by society,\u201d Prime Minister Manuel Valls mused carefully in an interview with the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration. \u201cNuit Debout is expressing this, in its own way.\u201d\n\nThe concessions were quick in coming. Fearful of an unbudging 25 percent youth unemployment and a permanent mobilization in the streets, the government two weeks ago called in student union leaders and agreed to spend upward of 400 million euros (about $450 million) in subsidies, taxes and allowances aimed at helping young people find work.\n\nHigh school graduates looking for work will now get government help for four months. Temporary work contracts \u2014 the bane of new entrants to the job market, since they represent most hires \u2014 will be taxed, to encourage more employers to hire people permanently. (The effect so far has been the opposite: Employer associations are infuriated.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDissatisfaction with the government, a hit film with a French super-boss as its target that was inspired by the American documentary maker Michael Moore, and the capital\u2019s floating cast of permanent protest organizers helped congeal the new movement.\n\nNuit Debout\u2019s organizers say they are not organizers, and the man anointed its \u201cmaster thinker\u201d in the French news media \u2014 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lordon, a left-leaning economist at France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research \u2014 scoffs at the idea.\n\n\u201cIt would be claiming a position of authority, and that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a \u2018master thinker.\u2019 They are producing ideas in every direction. They don\u2019t have a leader or a spokesman.\u201d Nuit Debout, he added, was practicing \u201chorizontal democracy.\u201d\n\nAmong the rank and file, that sentiment is shared. Andrea, 27, who was working in the \u201cLogistics\u201d tent at the Place de la R\u00e9publique, refused to give her last name \u2014 in the style of Nuit Debout\u2019s organizers \u2014 because she said she did not want to be singled out as a leader.\n\nBut she described the evolution of the movement. \u201cAfter one of the demonstrations, we said, \u2018Let\u2019s not go home,\u2019 \u201d she explained.\n\nStarting as a reaction against the labor-code overhaul, the protest organizers pondered the question: \u201cHow can we make them scared?\u201d said Andrea, who said she was also on Nuit Debout\u2019s \u201clegal team.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is pleased, of course.\n\nA luminary of the right-wing opposition, Brice Hortefeux, is furious that Paris\u2019s mayor allows the continuing mass protest when France is still under a state of emergency after the terrorist attacks in November. \u201cNight, standing up, government, standing down!\u201d he fumed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

A headline in Le Figaro on Thursday read: \u201cGovernment paralyzed in the face of Nuit Debout.\u201d\n\nIts economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, a former banker despised by France\u2019s left for being too pro-capitalist, announced he was forming his own political movement, as his colleagues in the government grumbled about him anonymously in the press.\n\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, facing near-certain defeat in elections next year, told television interviewers that \u201cthings are getting better,\u201d which only provoked derision in the news media and on the streets.\n\nThe president\u2019s soothing words were not enough to clear the Place de la R\u00e9publique, nor has a sometimes heavy police presence hovering in the background.\n\nFor now, the movement\u2019s daily twists and turns are chronicled anxiously on the left and the right as if it were a pop star: \u201cNuit Debout Thinks About Its Future,\u201d was the front-page headline in Lib\u00e9ration last weekend.\n\nThat followed headlines the movement made when it expelled to jeers and spittle the right-leaning philosopher Alain Finkielkraut, or appeared to have too many bearded leftist teachers and not enough workers, or was not appealing enough to people in the beleaguered suburbs.\n\nWhile they try to make up their minds or decide their next moves, the participants seem to be having too good a time to leave, just yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an agreeable movement. It shows we\u2019re still living in a democracy,\u201d said Emmanuel Colas, 22, a computer software expert, watching the action recently on the side. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes me love France. There are loads of people here. It\u2019s not going to change things radically. But all these people are showing they love liberty.\u201d\n\nOn a rare temperate evening the appeal seemed obvious. \u201cThey are attempting another way of doing politics,\u201d said Florent Chappel, an engineer at the Housing Ministry. \u201cIt\u2019s stimulating; it\u2019s a taking-hold of conscience. A sort of vitality, a will to re-enchant the world.\u201d", "summary": "The French movement was born in anger at the government\u2019s attempt to overhaul France\u2019s ponderous labor code, in hopes of making it easier for employers to hire and provide jobs for just the kinds of young people who have now occupied the square.
