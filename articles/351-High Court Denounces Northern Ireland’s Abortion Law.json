Abortions are permitted only in cases where a woman\u2019s life is threatened or where there is a permanent or serious risk to her well-being.\n\nEmployees at hospitals in Northern Ireland face life in prison if convicted of carrying out an illegal procedure, and hundreds of women in Northern Ireland travel to Britain, primarily England, every year for abortions. More than 800 women did so in 2013, five of them under the age of 16, the court was told.\n\nThe case was brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.\n\nIn delivering the ruling, Judge Mark Horner said that there was no political will to change the law, and that current legislation was compounding the trauma experienced by victims of rape and incest.\n\n\u201cShe has to face all the dangers and problems, emotional or otherwise, of carrying a fetus for which she bears no moral responsibility and is merely a receptacle to carry the child of a rapist and/or a person who has committed incest, or both,\u201d Judge Horner said in delivering the ruling, which took more than 90 minutes.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, the law is enforcing prohibition of abortion against an innocent victim of a crime in a way which completely ignores the personal circumstances of the victim.\u201d"}
