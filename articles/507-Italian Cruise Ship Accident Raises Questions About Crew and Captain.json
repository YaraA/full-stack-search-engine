The couple was found inside a cabin, said Luca Cari, a spokesman for the Italian fire brigade that rescued them.\n\nLater, firefighters rescued the ship\u2019s purser by helicopter, hoisting him strapped to a stretcher. The purser, Manrico Giampedroni, 57, from the northwestern region of Liguria, had a broken leg.\n\nDivers searching submerged cabins found the bodies of two elderly men, one from Spain and one from Italy, both wearing life jackets, said Cmdr. Cosimo Nicastro, a coast guard spokesman. The deaths brought the number of people confirmed dead to five.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmong the people still missing were 11 passengers and 6 crew members, said Enrico Rossi, president of the Tuscany region. The United States State Department said Sunday that 120 Americans had been on board and all but 2 had been accounted for.\n\nThrough the day, Italian fire brigades circled the massive ship, which lay on its side like a beached whale, with a wide gash just below the waterline and a rock jutting through its hull. The firefighters tapped the hull and listened for any responses from people trapped inside.\n\nRescuers were focusing their efforts on the part of the ship still above water. \u201cThe likelihood that we can find somebody alive in the underwater cabins is very low, so we are aiming at the ones possibly trapped above water,\u201d said Mr. Cari, the fire spokesman.\n\nSo far, his crews had searched only a quarter of that area, parts of which are blocked by debris. He said the sunken portion of the ship would be inspected through the porthole windows during the night by divers with flashlights.\n\nVideo\n\nOn the tiny island of Giglio, some residents had tended to survivors through the night on Friday, offering hot tea and dry clothes. At Mass on Sunday morning at the Giglio Porto church, a priest placed a life jacket, a rope and a rescue helmet on the altar to honor the dead and missing.\n\n\u201cGiglio will no longer be the same,\u201d said Don Lorenzo, the priest. \u201cLet\u2019s us all pray together now for our souls.\u201d\n\nWhile the investigation continued, residents, many of whom are sailors, had little doubt about the cause of the accident, saying the captain had tried to thread a narrow passage between the rocks that was too small for the 114,500-ton ship.\n\n\u201cWe used to get kind of close to the shore to show off its beauty, to entertain passengers,\u201d said Demetrio Mattera, 75, a former cruise ship sailor here. \u201cBut never so close.\u201d"}
