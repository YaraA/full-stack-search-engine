Ms. Merkel called the clashes and anti-immigrant protests \u201cshameful and offensive.\u201d\n\nPledging to \u201cdo everything possible to make clear that Germany helps where help is needed,\u201d she said that when Parliament reconvened in September, legal changes would be made to help cope with the influx of asylum seekers.\n\nGermany\u2019s ministry for migrants and refugees has already decided to allow any Syrians reaching the country to apply for asylum, even if they have already been registered in another European Union member country. (Asylum seekers must normally apply for recognition as a refugee in the country where they entered the bloc, according to European Union law.)\n\nMs. Merkel has been a target of criticism from opposition politicians and from the general public over her handling of the migrant crisis. A campaign on social media under the hashtag #Merkelschweigt, which translates to \u201cMerkel stays silent,\u201d denounced what many see as her lack of a clear stance against the attacks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, President Joachim Gauck visited a refugee reception center in a western Berlin neighborhood, where he praised the engagement of Germans who have donated their time and energy to welcome the arrivals and help them adapt.\n\n\u201cIt is important to me that Germany recognizes the helpful efforts of these hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d Mr. Gauck said. \u201cThis is the clear answer to the agitators and arsonists. We will tell them, \u2018You do not represent us. We will not tolerate this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe violence has continued, however, with the police in the northeastern German city of Parchim reporting that two people with knives had been arrested after entering a refugee home in the city late on Tuesday. The same night, a man threw a burning object at a planned home for 56 refugees in the eastern city of Leipzig, causing a mattress to catch fire, the police reported.\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s cabinet approved a measure on Wednesday to double the amount of funding for the care and processing of asylum seekers to 1 billion euros, or about $1.15 billion. Responsibility for processing refugee applications falls to the country\u2019s 16 states and their various municipalities, but with 800,000 people expected to apply for refugee status in Germany this year, local governments are straining to accommodate the influx.", "summary": "Yet many countries, including Germany, are struggling to process the number of asylum seekers, leading to unrest and difficult conditions at overcrowded reception centers. \u201cGiven what we have all been forced to see here, I would like to recall that the humane and dignified treatment of every individual who comes to us is part of Germany\u2019s national identity,\u201d Ms. Merkel said after visiting the center in Heidenau, near Dresden, that was the site of violent protests over the weekend.
