She moved to the city from Bulgaria a year ago, she said, and within two days she had found an apartment and a job, as a chef in a vegetarian restaurant.\n\n\u201cI have never felt pushed away,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s very welcoming.\u201d\n\nBut she and many other Londoners are feeling very odd and alienated these days, as the reality of the vote sinks in and they wonder what will happen to their city if the divorce from the European Union goes through. Much of the Leave vote turned on a desire to limit immigration and restore \u201cBritish values,\u201d while London prides itself on its ability to attract and absorb outsiders.\n\nThree million of its eight million residents were born in other countries. One hundred languages are spoken in the city. London just elected its first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, whose parents moved to the city from Pakistan in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cLondon is like the capital of Europe, and it\u2019s the biggest financial capital in the world,\u201d said Alexandra Lewis, 19, a college student in Bristol. Her London high school had students from all over, she recalled, and the British-born were in the minority.\n\nLondon, she said, \u201cneeds the connections with Europe much more than the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nThe referendum spurred demonstrations, anguish and anger across the capital, as well as dreams that the city could somehow detach itself and form its own state. A freelance writer in London, James O\u2019Malley, started a petition calling for \u201cLondependence,\u201d an idea that had already begun to waft around Facebook. To his surprise, more than 175,000 people quickly signed the petition.\n\nMr. O\u2019Malley had thought up the petition as a jokey protest, he explained in an article in The Daily Telegraph. He does not really think London should become a city-state like Monaco or Singapore or begin issuing its own currency, for instance. But he does support increased autonomy.\n\n\u201cIf Scotland gets to make its own laws to reflect its own unique politics, why not the capital?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe all know \u2014 and the referendum made clear \u2014 that London has very different politics to the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe mayor, Mr. Khan, agrees. Many of the city\u2019s affairs are still controlled by the national government, and he has limited authority compared with the mayor of, say, New York. Mr. Khan said he would begin pressing for the same sort of devolved powers that the national government has granted to Scotland and Wales.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of all Londoners, I am demanding more autonomy for the capital \u2014 right now,\u201d Mr. Khan said in a speech last week. \u201cMore autonomy to protect London\u2019s economy from the uncertainty ahead, to protect the businesses from around the world who trade here, and to protect our jobs, wealth and prosperity.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

He and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, issued a statement saying they would \u201cbuild far stronger alliances between cities across Europe and around the world.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of ways London might distance itself from Brexit, \u201cshort of building a moat around the city,\u201d Parag Khanna argued in Foreign Policy magazine. \u201cThere is a wide spectrum of federalist arrangements available to the city, on a continuum ranging from unity to devolution to autonomy to outright independence.\u201d\n\nBut just as the vote has set city against country, it has set neighbor against neighbor within the city. There are really many Londons. One is rich, cosmopolitan London, the London of the financial district, of wealthy areas like Mayfair, Hampstead and Kensington, of people who can afford to travel across Britain, Europe and the rest of the world, of immigrants who have prospered.\n\nAnother is the London of longtime residents like Charmaine Williams, 55, a government social worker. Ms. Williams said she had not seen any advantages to European Union membership, only more people coming from Eastern Europe and using London\u2019s already stretched public services. So she voted yes to Brexit.\n\n\u201cThey should fix things at home before they try to fix everyone else,\u201d Ms. Williams said.\n\nA series of devastating budget cuts in recent years under the government\u2019s austerity plans has taken a toll on her work, she said.\n\nThe Brexit question is complicated, said Ms. Lewis, the college student. To denounce those who voted to leave as ignorant and shortsighted, she said, is to think you are smarter and more enlightened, to pit the city not just against the rest of Britain but also, in a way, against itself.\n\nShe does not want to feel that way, yet she cannot shake the sense that London \u2014 or, at least, her London \u2014 is truly different from everywhere else.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be seen as superior, or trying to lecture them about what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel that I\u2019m apart from the rest of the country.\u201d", "summary": "Much of the Leave vote turned on a desire to limit immigration and restore \u201cBritish values,\u201d while London prides itself on its ability to attract and absorb outsiders.
