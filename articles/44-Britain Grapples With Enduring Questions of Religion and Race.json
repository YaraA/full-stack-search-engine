Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. instead.\n\nBut the dispute touched deeper chords here about whether Britain can better control its borders and defend itself from terrorism from within or outside the European Union.\n\nMany of those who favor a British exit, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d argue that only outside the European Union can Britain truly control its borders and limit immigration. But behind the anxiety about immigration is not only fear of losing jobs to foreigners, but of potential terrorist acts carried out by Muslim extremists with European Union citizenship who have gone to Syria to embrace jihad and then have returned to Europe and its freedom of travel.\n\nThat freedom is limited by Britain\u2019s refusal to join the Schengen passport-free zone, meaning that all foreigners who wish to enter Britain can be checked. But it is also true that one or more of the men responsible for the November terrorist attacks in Paris, reportedly including the apparent ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, were able to come to Britain the previous summer without difficulty.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of those anxieties have surfaced in what has become a nasty campaign to succeed Mr. Johnson as mayor of London. In both the exit debate and the mayoral race, it is the side that is thought to be losing that has ratcheted up the rhetoric, at times verging on racism and Islamophobia, that has upset many Britons.\n\nThe Labour Party candidate for mayor, Sadiq Khan, has been attacked by his Conservative opponent, Zac Goldsmith, for previous appearances alongside Islamic extremists \u2014 criticism repeated by Mr. Cameron in Parliament.\n\nThe contrast between Mr. Khan, 45, and Mr. Goldsmith, 41, is stark. Mr. Khan, the son of Muslim immigrants from Pakistan, was raised with seven siblings in a public housing unit with three bedrooms. His father drove a London bus, and his mother was a seamstress.\n\nMr. Goldsmith lived in an 18th-century mansion; attended Eton (where he was thrown out for smoking cannabis); and inherited a fortune from his billionaire father, the tycoon Sir James Goldsmith.\n\nWere Mr. Khan to succeed in the May 5 election, he would be the first Muslim to lead the city that dominates Britain\u2019s economic, cultural and political life, and where nearly one in eight residents is Muslim.\n\nBackground on \u2018Brexit\u2019\n\nBut his past as a human rights lawyer and activist has been highlighted by Mr. Goldsmith, who describes Mr. Khan as a \u201cthreat to London,\u201d accusing him of \u201cappalling judgment.\u201d Mr. Goldsmith has suggested that by speaking on the same platform as those with radical views or who had been accused of supporting terrorists, Mr. Khan gave tacit support to extremism.\n\nIn response, Mr. Khan has defended his commitment to human rights. He claims that Mr. Goldsmith wants to divide communities and accuses him of targeting voters, especially Indian voters, along ethnic lines during a \u201cdesperate, negative campaign\u201d intended to inflame anxiety about Muslims.\n\nMr. Cameron recently joined the argument, telling Parliament that Mr. Khan had appeared publicly nine times with Suliman Gani, an imam who Mr. Cameron claimed \u201csupports I.S.,\u201d referring to the Islamic State.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Khan has acknowledged contacts with Mr. Gani, a constituent. But Mr. Khan said that his support for plans to legalize same-sex marriage prompted Mr. Gani to campaign against him, and that Mr. Khan helped remove Mr. Gani as an imam.\n\nMr. Gani called the allegation a \u201csmear on my good name\u201d and described the Islamic State as a \u201cterrorist and inhumane organization.\u201d He also released a photograph of himself alongside Mr. Goldsmith.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Khan acknowledged that the accusations may have done him damage. \u201cIf I have given the impression, somehow, by being a human rights lawyer that somehow I have similar views to people I abhor, that would be something that I would regret,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

The party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been criticized for not doing enough to stamp out anti-Semitic views in the party.\n\nThe difficulty is defining the line between anti-Semitism and principled support for Palestine, opposition to Israeli settlements in occupied territory and \u201canti-Zionism.\u201d\n\nMr. Corbyn, who has been a fierce critic of Israel, has spoken out against anti-Semitism in the party, but critics say he has not taken tough enough action to expel those who evince it.\n\nThe same issue has come up again recently with the election of Malia Bouattia, 28, as the first black Muslim woman to lead the National Union of Students.\n\nFor her supporters, her election is a victory for diversity and radical politics. But Jewish students\u2019 groups are alarmed, citing her criticism of the influence of \u201cZionist-led media,\u201d her description of her Birmingham University as \u201csomething of a Zionist outpost\u201d because of its active Jewish organizations and her talk at a meeting that was advertised with a poster featuring Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah.\n\nWithin a few hours of her victory, students at Cambridge called for a referendum on whether their union should quit the national body, describing her election as \u201ca horrifying message to Jewish students.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Bouattia has denied any anti-Semitism and has offered to meet with her critics.", "summary": "That comment provoked furious claims that Mr. Johnson, often mentioned as a potential successor to Prime Minister David Cameron, was making a smear based on Mr. Obama\u2019s race in order to undermine his arguments in favor of Britain remaining in the bloc.
