But the situation in Greece shows how quickly such vigilante activity can expand as a government is either too preoccupied with the financial crisis or unable or disinclined to deal with the problem. Greece\u2019s new prime minister, Antonis Samaras , has said he wants to put an end to the \u201cinvasion\u201d of illegal immigrants, but \u201cwithout vigilantism, without extremism.\u201d Yet, as attacks mount even against legal immigrants, he has addressed the violence infrequently.\n\nPhoto\n\nNo country willingly tolerates a large population of illegal immigrants, and Greece, a gateway for migrants from Africa and Asia , has long had more than its share. Its border with Turkey is regarded as the most porous in Europe, and European laws require countries to return illegal migrants to the country from which they entered the European Union .\n\nWhile that law is suspended in Greece pending a court case, many remain trapped here because of paperwork problems, with no job or means of integrating. They wind up settling in rougher neighborhoods, deepening trends of poverty, crime and drug dealing, and unleashing a wave of popular discontent for Golden Dawn to ride.\n\nThreats, beatings and vows by Golden Dawn followers to \u201crid the land of filth,\u201d sporadic problems in recent years, have become commonplace since the party claimed 18 of Parliament\u2019s 300 seats in the elections last month, even after Ilias Kasidiaris, the party\u2019s spokesman, repeatedly slapped a female rival during a televised debate.\n\nWhile some attackers are being arrested, Human Rights Watch and other groups accuse the Greek police of increasingly looking the other way when confronted with evidence of violence, and even standing by while the beatings are going on. All of this, the report by Human Rights Watch says, is \u201cin stark contrast to government reassurances.\u201d\n\nThe report further states that illegal migrants \u201cwere routinely discouraged from filing official complaints,\u201d and that \u201cthe police told some victims they would have to pay a fee to file a complaint.\u201d In addition, it says, the police told some victims to fight back themselves.\n\n\u201cWe have hundreds of reports from people who are beaten while policemen were standing there doing nothing,\u201d said Thanassis Kourkoulas, the spokesman for Expel Racism, an immigrant support group. He said officers had been accused of assaulting immigrants in police stations and of giving the telephone number of Golden Dawn to citizens who called with complaints about crime and immigrants.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven a former police union chief, Dimitris Kyriazidis, recently accused police officials of turning \u201ca blind eye to extreme-right groups that are affiliated to Golden Dawn and which are running amok across the country.\u201d A Greek police spokesman, Christos Manouras, strongly denied any official tolerance of attacks on immigrants or any links to or collaboration with Golden Dawn. \u201cIt is not even up for discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cPolice officers are always on the citizens\u2019 side and make anguished efforts every day to tackle whatever problems may arise and to boost security.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, Golden Dawn\u2019s allure is seeping more into the mainstream amid reports of rising crime in areas where poor illegal migrants are concentrated. In Parliament recently, Golden Dawn\u2019s nominee for a deputy speaker position was backed by 41 lawmakers, an indication of either support or tolerance from major political parties.\n\nArmed with promises to restore jobs and order, the group is increasing its presence even in some middle-class areas. Burly black-clad men who hew to nationalistic and xenophobic slogans offer protection to older people, the poor and Greek business owners.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As the crisis devours business, he has grown exasperated with illegal Pakistani and African immigrants who make money selling fake designer purses outside his door.\n\n\u201cThey are killing jobs for Greek people,\u201d Mr. Papadeas said as he stood under a gilt-leaf painting of the Madonna. \u201cThey scare customers away, and they engage in criminality. I\u2019m not racist, but something needs to be done.\u201d\n\nHe said he almost asked Golden Dawn to \u201cclean the streets\u201d but hesitated as reports of its methods proliferated. His family cares for a skeletal Kenyan immigrant, Omar, whom he said the group beat savagely one day. \u201cStill,\u201d Mr. Papadeas said, \u201cI\u2019m very tempted to call them because the police are nowhere to be found.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nAs Golden Dawn tries to expand its sphere of influence, many Greeks are growing alarmed by what they see as echoes of ultraright ideology in a country that resisted Nazi occupation during World War II . In response, some communities are forming antifascist countermovements, turning once-abstract ideological differences into a street-level struggle.\n\nSo far, rights groups say, the protests have been peaceful. \u201cBut we\u2019re afraid something could go wrong one day if the violence continues,\u201d said Marios Augoustetos, a graphic designer who is involved in Expel Racism.\n\nMr. Kasidiaris, the Golden Dawn spokesman, denied accusations of vigilantism, including charges of beatings and extremism. \u201cThis is not serious stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s science fiction, a screenplay and an urban legend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNevertheless, the drumbeat of threats and attacks against immigrants continues to gain force, victims and rights groups say. Marco Moheb, 30, a legalized Egyptian immigrant, said he was attacked in May near a police station in Kalithea, a middle-class suburb.\n\nThe police had jailed his nephew for walking without identification papers, he said. When Mr. Moheb delivered them, he said, the police photographed him and warned him not to return through the main square. He said he ignored the advice because alternate routes were too long, and minutes after he left the station he was surrounded and beaten by 12 men, he said, some of them wearing shirts with the Golden Dawn insignia, leaving him hospitalized with a concussion . \u201cIt was like it was arranged,\u201d Mr. Moheb said.\n\nAt a high school blocks from where the episode occurred, students and teachers said Golden Dawn had reached into schools. Recently, several male students sympathetic to the group left their classrooms and beat a passing dark-skinned mail carrier, said Elena Siozou, 16, a student. \u201cPlanting violence in young people is the worst thing someone can do,\u201d she said.\n\nBack in Nikaia, Mr. Irfan, the hair salon owner, said immigrants were thinking of ways to protect themselves and their families. \u201cI love this country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want someone to kill me.\u201d\n\nHe is thinking of leaving if the situation worsens. \u201cBut even if every immigrant were kicked out, would that solve Greece\u2019s economic problems, create jobs or bring higher salaries or pensions for Greeks?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the crisis that\u2019s destroying jobs, but we are getting the blame.\u201d", "summary": "They wind up settling in rougher neighborhoods, deepening trends of poverty, crime and drug dealing, and unleashing a wave of popular discontent for Golden Dawn to ride.While some attackers are being arrested, Human Rights Watch and other groups accuse the Greek police of increasingly looking the other way when confronted with evidence of violence, and even standing by while the beatings are going on.In Parliament recently, Golden Dawn\u2019s nominee for a deputy speaker position was backed by 41 lawmakers, an indication of either support or tolerance from major political parties.As Golden Dawn tries to expand its sphere of influence, many Greeks are growing alarmed by what they see as echoes of ultraright ideology in a country that resisted Nazi occupation during World War II .He said he ignored the advice because alternate routes were too long, and minutes after he left the station he was surrounded and beaten by 12 men, he said, some of them wearing shirts with the Golden Dawn insignia, leaving him hospitalized with a concussion ."}
