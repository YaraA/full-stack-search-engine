One poll, conducted over the Internet and also not random, showed supporters of independence in a clear lead. That poll \u201ccomes with a substantial health warning,\u201d John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, wrote on his blog, citing a small polling sample. \u201cThe finding, while not wholly disregarded, should clearly be viewed with caution.\u201d\n\nSome polls indicate that at least 6 percent of potential voters say they are undecided, which could make a difference.

Though the voting age in Scotland is normally 18, this referendum allows those age 16 and over to vote. And as a reflection of the importance of the question, 4.3 million people are registered to vote \u2014 97 percent of those eligible. Turnout is expected to be much higher than that of a normal local or general election.\n\nThe final weekend of campaigning brought thousands of people onto the streets of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Rival leaders worked across the country to persuade undecided voters. The pro-independence \u201cyes\u201d campaign vowed a get-out-the-vote effort with 35,000 volunteers delivering 2.6 million leaflets.\n\nThe leader of the \u201cno\u201d campaign, \u201cBetter Together,\u201d warned Scots about the economic dangers of independence and talked up a shared history, full of wartime sacrifice.\n\nThe campaign had been led by a former Labour minister, Alistair Darling, who said that as many as 500,000 people are still undecided, and that one million jobs are at stake. But as the panic has grown among British leaders about the prospect of Scottish independence, the former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, has taken the lead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlex Salmond, head of the Scottish National Party, said on Sunday he was confident that independence would win, and he hoped for \u201ca substantial majority,\u201d so that he could work to unite Scots after a divisive and sometimes nasty campaign.\n\nMr. Cameron has said that if Scotland does vote for independence, he would not resign. But he serves at the pleasure of the Conservative Party, which is already deeply riven over Europe and immigration. The party is also angry with Mr. Cameron for not having won the 2010 election outright, and having to govern in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn Scotland, the Sunday Herald, which backs independence, filled its front page with photographs of \u201cyes\u201d voters under the headline, \u201cNow is the time .... you are the generation.\u201d\n\nAnd while aides to Queen Elizabeth II, who is also queen of Scotland, insist she is strictly neutral on such a vexed political issue, Prince Harry, her grandson, made his feelings clear. Presiding over the international Invictus Games in London, for those wounded in the military, he said he would like the next Games, in 2016, to remain \u201cin the U.K. \u2014 maybe Glasgow, maybe Sheffield.\u201d", "summary": "The vote is a single-question referendum about independence after 307 years of union with England, and despite serious concerns about the financial and employment impact of going it alone, the opinion polls over the weekend only heightened the uncertainty about the outcome.The leader of the \u201cno\u201d campaign, \u201cBetter Together,\u201d warned Scots about the economic dangers of independence and talked up a shared history, full of wartime sacrifice.But as the panic has grown among British leaders about the prospect of Scottish independence, the former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, has taken the lead.Alex Salmond, head of the Scottish National Party, said on Sunday he was confident that independence would win, and he hoped for \u201ca substantial majority,\u201d so that he could work to unite Scots after a divisive and sometimes nasty campaign.In Scotland, the Sunday Herald, which backs independence, filled its front page with photographs of \u201cyes\u201d voters under the headline, \u201cNow is the time .... you are the generation.\u201d"}
