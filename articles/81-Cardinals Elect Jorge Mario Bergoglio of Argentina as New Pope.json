He is also the first non-European pope in more than 1,200 years and the first member of the Jesuit order to lead the church.\n\nIn choosing Francis, 76, who had been the archbishop of Buenos Aires, the cardinals sent a powerful message that the future of the church lies in the global south, home to the bulk of the world\u2019s Catholics.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank you for your embrace,\u201d the new pope, dressed in white, said from the white balcony on St. Peter\u2019s Basilica as thousands cheered joyously below. \u201cMy brother cardinals have chosen one who is from far away, but here I am.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Italian as he blessed the faithful, Francis asked the audience to \u201cpray for me, and we\u2019ll see each other soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood night, and have a good rest,\u201d he concluded, in a grandfatherly, almost casual tone.\n\n\u201cHabemus papam!\u201d members of the crowd shouted in Latin, waving umbrellas and flags. \u201cWe have a pope!\u201d Others cried, \u201cViva il Papa!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was like waiting for the birth of a baby, only better,\u201d said a Roman man, Giuliano Uncini. A child sitting atop his father\u2019s shoulders waved a crucifix.\n\nFrancis is known as a humble man who spoke out for the poor and led an austere life in Buenos Aires. He was born to Italian immigrant parents and was raised in the Argentine capital.\n\nThe new pope inherits a church wrestling with an array of challenges that intensified during his predecessor, Benedict XVI, including a shortage of priests, growing competition from evangelical churches in the Southern Hemisphere, a sexual abuse crisis that has undermined the church\u2019s moral authority in the West and difficulties governing the Vatican itself.\n\nBenedict abruptly ended his troubled eight-year papacy last month, announcing he was no longer up to the rigors of the job. He became the first pontiff in 598 years to resign. The 115 cardinals who are younger than 80 and eligible to vote chose their new leader after two days of voting.\n\nPope Francis spoke by telephone with Benedict on Wednesday evening, said a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi. He called it \u201can act of great significance and pastorality\u201d that Francis\u2019 first act as pope was to offer a prayer for his predecessor.\n\nThe Rev. Thomas Rosica of Canada, another Vatican spokesman, recalled meeting Cardinal Bergoglio a decade ago during preparations for World Youth Day in Canada, and said the cardinal had told him that he lived very simply, in an apartment Buenos Aires, and sold the archdiocese\u2019s mansion.\n\n\u201cHe cooks for himself and took great pride in telling us that, and that he took the bus to work\u201d rather than riding in a car, Father Rosica said.\n\nPresident Obama was among the first world leaders to congratulate Francis in a message that emphasized the pope\u2019s humble roots and New World background.\n\n\u201cAs a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us, he carries forth the message of love and compassion that has inspired the world for more than 2,000 years \u2014 that in each other we see the face of God,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a message released by the White House.\n\n\u201cAs the first pope from the Americas,\u201d the president added, \u201chis selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day.\u201d\n\nA doctrinal conservative, Francis has opposed liberation theology, abortion, gay marriage and the ordination of women, standing with his predecessor in holding largely traditional views.\n\nAs archbishop of Buenos Aires beginning in 1998 and a cardinal since 2001, he frequently tangled with Argentina\u2019s governments over social issues. In 2010, for example, he castigated a government-supported law to legalize marriage and adoption by same-sex couples as \u201ca war against God.\u201d\n\nHe has been less energetic, however, in urging the Argentine church to examine its own behavior during the 1970s, when the country was consumed by a conflict between right and left. In what became known as the Dirty War, as many as 30,000 people were disappeared, tortured or killed by a military dictatorship that seized power in March 1976.\n\nIn a long interview with an Argentine newspaper in 2010, Cardinal Bergoglio defended his behavior during the dictatorship. He said that he had helped hide people being sought for arrest or disappearance by the military because of their political views, had helped others leave Argentina and had lobbied the country\u2019s military rulers directly for the release and protection of others.\n\nBefore beginning the voting by secret ballot in the Sistine Chapel on Tuesday, in a cloistered meeting known as a conclave, the cardinals swore an oath of secrecy in Latin, a rite designed to protect deliberations from outside scrutiny \u2014 and to protect cardinals from earthly influence as they seek divine guidance.\n\nThe conclave followed more than a week of intense, broader discussions among the world\u2019s cardinals about the problems facing the church and their criteria for its next leader.\n\n\u201cWe spoke among ourselves in an exceptional and free way, with great truth, about the lights but also about shadows in the current situation of the Catholic Church,\u201d Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn of Vienna, a theologian known for his intellect and his pastoral touch, told reporters this week.\n\n\u201cThe pope\u2019s election is something substantially different from a political election,\u201d Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn said, adding that the role was not \u201cthe chief executive of a multinational company, but the spiritual head of a community of believers.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Benedict was selected in 2005 as a caretaker after the momentous papacy of John Paul II, but the shy theologian appeared to show little inclination toward management. His papacy suffered from crises of communications \u2014 with Muslims, Jews and Anglicans \u2014 that, along with a sex abuse crisis that raged back to life in Europe in 2010, evolved into a crisis of governance.\n\nCritics of Benedict\u2019s secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, said he had difficulties in running the Vatican and appeared more interested in the Vatican\u2019s ties to Italy than to the rest of the world. The Vatican is deeply concerned about the fate of Christians in the war-torn Middle East.\n\nThe new pope will also inherit power struggles over the management of the Vatican bank, which must continue a process of meeting international transparency standards or risk being shut out of the mainstream international banking system. In one of his final acts as pope, Benedict appointed a German aristocrat, Ernst von Freyberg, as the bank\u2019s new president.\n\nFrancis will have to help make the Vatican bureaucracy \u2014 often seen as a hornet\u2019s nest of infighting Italians \u2014 work more efficiently for the good of the church. After years in which Benedict and John Paul helped consolidate more power at the top, many liberal Catholics also hope that the new pope will give local bishops\u2019 conferences more decision-making power to help respond to the needs of the faithful.\n\nThe reform of the Roman Curia, which runs the Vatican, \u201cis not conceptually hard,\u201d said Alberto Melloni, the author of numerous books on the Vatican and the Second Vatican Council. \u201cit\u2019s hard on a political front, but it will take five minutes for someone who has the strength. You get rid of the spoil system, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThe hard things are \u201cif you want a permanent consultation of bishops\u2019 conferences,\u201d he added.\n\nFor Mr. Melloni, foreign policy and the church\u2019s vision of Asia would be crucial to the new pope. \u201cIf Roman Catholicism was capable of learning Greek while it was speaking Aramaic, of learning Celtic while it was speaking Latin, now it either has to learn Chinese or \u2018ciao,'\u201d he said, using the Italian world for \u201cgoodbye.\u201d\n\nAhead of the election, cardinals said they were looking for \u201ca pope that understands the problems of the church at present\u201d and who is strong enough to tackle them, said Cardinal Miloslav Vlk, the archbishop emeritus of Prague, who participated in the general congregations but was not eligible to vote in a conclave.\n\nHe said those problems included reforming the Roman Curia, handling the sex abuse crisis and cleaning up the Vatican bank.\n\n\u201cHe needs to be capable of solving these issues,\u201d Cardinal Vlk said as he walked near the Vatican this week, adding that the next pope needs \u201cto be open to the world, to the troubles of the world, to society, because evangelization is a primary task, to bring the Gospel to people.\u201d\n\nThe sexual abuse crisis remains a troubling issue for the church, especially in English-speaking countries where victims sued dioceses found to have moved around abusive priests.\n\nOn Wednesday, news reports in California showed that one cardinal elector, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the former archbishop of Los Angeles; the archdiocese; and a former priest had reached a settlement of almost $10 million in four child sex abuse cases, according to the victims\u2019 lawyers.\n\nBecoming pope also has a human dimension. In one of his final speeches as pope before he retired on Feb. 18, Benedict said his successor would need to be prepared to lose some of his privacy."}
